But recently, our collective interest in intelligent timepieces has spiked, and we have more and more powerful wrist-worn computers to choose from than ever -- whether made by startups with record-setting Kickstarter campaigns or the biggest names in consumer electronics. Of course, the biggest name of all, Apple, had yet to release one of its own. Well, the Watch has arrived, and its maker has loftier aspirations for it than the smartwatches preceding it. Apple's Watch isn't some utilitarian gadget -- it's jewelry, an object of lust, not only for what it can do, but also for how it looks. I'm not a watch person. Haven't worn one regularly since high school (I'm 33 years old now), and have never been enamored with the likes of Rolex or Longines. But the Apple Watch is, of course, much more than a mere time teller, and the company expects to sell a lot of these things to people like me -- you don't build a $700 billion company selling niche products, after all. The question is: Why would someone like me want one?

Most of the Watch's features can be categorized as nice to have (at best) or superfluous (at worst). As such, if you're not enamored with the Watch's appearance, it's probably not compelling enough to buy one. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware For the uninitiated, there are two sizes (38 or 42mm) and three Watch models: Sport, Watch and Edition. The entry-level Sport model starts at $349 and is made of aluminum, while the high-end Edition starts at $10,000 and is crafted of 18-karat rose or yellow gold. Apple loaned me a 42mm stainless steel Watch model ($549) with a bright, lime green Sport Band ($49 when sold separately) and a Link Bracelet ($449). In keeping with its aspirations to luxury jewelry and with Apple's usual obsessive attention to detail, the Watch case I received is constructed of machined, cold-forged steel polished to a high gloss. Its OLED screen on top and heart rate sensor on the bottom are sheathed in sapphire crystal, a material familiar to any luxe timepiece aficionado. (Note: Sport models make do without the sapphire protection.) The \"Digital Crown\" on the right edge is machined and polished too, as is the button with an ever-so-slightly chamfered edge alongside it. All of these elements are fitted together perfectly, with uniform gaps and nary a blemish to be found. The result is a watch that looks the part it's been cast to play -- assuming you dig the aesthetics of a rounded rectangle parked on your arm. It's the finest construction of any smartwatch I've seen, and none of the others are particularly close (second place: ASUS ZenWatch). More importantly (for Apple), it doesn't feel ridiculous to compare its build quality to something made by Tag Heuer or Cartier. The Sport Band is made of a pliable, soft-touch material called fluoroelastomer and can be had in white, blue, pink and black in addition to the green I received. The Link Bracelet's made of brushed stainless steel (a Space Black Stainless Steel Watch and matching bracelet are also available, though the black bracelet isn't available for purchase separately). There's a plethora of other straps available for the Watch made of metal and leather, as well. While I'm not wild about the color of the Sport Band I've been using, the green cuts a striking image on my wrist, and has garnered my Watch far more (favorable) attention on the street than when I've worn the metal bracelet. As you might expect, the rubbery Sport Band is the more comfortable of the two, and even though it's a more casual look, I am impressed with its fit and finish; there's not a seam to be found on the thing, which keeps it looking and feeling premium (for a rubber strap). Meanwhile, the Link Bracelet is a marvelous bit of engineering, with a unique quad-hinged clasp that latches and releases with rifle-bolt precision. It also has links that can be removed with a simple button press, which makes fitting the bracelet a relatively painless process. Pressing the release button while pulling on the appropriate links required more fiddling than I expected, but it also gets easier the more times you do it. The bracelet is comprised of a single band of horizontal scales, which sets it apart visually from the three or four vertical bands of links in most other watch bracelets. The effect reminds me of the scales you find on the belly of a snake, and I dig the simplicity. When combined with the polished steel Watch case, however, the brushed finish on the bracelet looks incongruous to my eye. Not to the point of distraction, but for a company that so sweats the little things like Apple does, I'm surprised that such a choice was made. At least it matches the bracelet in its precision construction, and the two fit together almost seamlessly. Getting started #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-197206{display:none;} .cke_show_borders #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-197206, #postcontentcontainer #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-197206{width:570px;display:block;} try{document.getElementById(\"fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-197206\").style.display=\"none\";}catch(e){} Setting up the Watch is straightforward. Upon powering it up for the first time, it'll prompt you to pick a language, then open up the Watch app -- which is included with iOS 8.3 -- on your iPhone 5 or later. Tap the 'Start Pairing' option on your Watch and a dancing point cloud (think of it as a beautiful QR code) appears. Point your phone's camera at the Watch's screen, and once the point cloud forms itself into a circular rosette, presto! You're paired. Then, you'll need to agree to the terms and conditions, link up your Apple ID, create a Watch-specific passcode and let it sync all of the compatible apps and info with your iPhone. The whole process takes less than 10 minutes. Apple's Watch display is an OLED unit which, in the 42mm version has a 390 x 312 resolution that performs well in just about any lighting condition. Colors are vibrant; blacks are inky; and it's viewable in direct sunlight, despite washing out (as is the case with every screen I've ever used in such conditions). The default mode for that screen is off, but it wakes up when you either touch it or twist your wrist so the Watch thinks you're looking at it. Much digital ink has been spilled about the split-second delay between raising your wrist and seeing the time, and it is noticeable, but I found the slight impediment didn't bother me. The bigger issue is when the first arm motion fails to trigger the display, which forces you to either repeat the process or tap the screen to wake it up. Should you have more than one Watch band to choose from, swapping them is a similarly easy affair. On the underside of the Watch sit two-flush mounted buttons that serve to release each side of the band, and those buttons need only be depressed slightly, if deliberately, to release. Sliding the ends out of the channels milled into the top and bottom edges of the Watch in which they reside isn't hard, although doing so smoothly took a few tries before I got the hang of it. Also, re-inserting the Link Bracelet requires sliding the tip of one side in before seating the other and pushing them both in simultaneously. Once you feel a muted \"snick\" on both sides, your band of choice is secure. The mechanism is brilliant in its simplicity and execution, and makes swapping straps a far simpler process than the pin system on your standard watchband or a trip to the jewelers. Given the wide selection of straps Apple is offering out of the gate (and with more to come, no doubt), this feature is of greater importance than you might think. Any wearable device aspiring to be fashionable has to look good, and the ability to tailor colors and styles to taste so easily is key to the Watch's appeal. (And, in what I'm sure is a completely unintended side effect, this portends greater commercial success -- buying multiple bands makes less sense if you have to head to the nearest jeweler to change them.) But tailoring the physical look is only part of the equation. Apple has built in digital personalization options, too. The company has put together a user guide that comprehensively elucidates all that the Watch can do, so for the purposes of this review, I'll stick to the highlights. In use Generally speaking, the modes of interaction on the Watch's user interface are straightforward, if not always intuitive. In keeping with its primary function, your homescreen is, naturally, a watch face, with the app launcher cloud hidden a layer below. Accessing it is a mere press of the Digital Crown away. Press it again and you're taken back to your watch face. I found it helpful to think of depressing that crown as a sort of analogue for the iPhone's home button, as double-clicking it also takes you straight back to the last app you've used. Scrolling through options and zooming in and out with that little knob made perfect sense from the start -- I'm all about reducing fingerprints on shiny gadget surfaces, and the crown helps curb those smudges. Another unique bit of UI comes in the form of Apple's new Taptic Engine, a linear actuator that delivers haptic feedback. Far from a mere buzz or vibration, the engine delivers more detailed and nuanced tactile feedback, that in effect is not unlike Immersion's HD haptic technology. Differentiating between the sensation of the different sorts of taps and rumbles it provides isn't easy at first, but the more I felt the feedback, the more attuned I became. Aside from the watch, app tray and individual applications, the Watch comes with a feature called Glances. A swipe up on the watch face drops you into a carousel of widgets for various apps and functions to let you get a quick look at battery life, the weather, or scores from teams you follow. You can add and subtract Glances in the companion iPhone app, though the only one I really found useful was a status screen that shows if the Watch is connected to your phone and lets you toggle airplane, do-not-disturb and silent modes. You can also ping your iPhone if you've misplaced it. While the UI does take some getting used to, I settled into using the Digital Crown/touchscreen combo after a couple of days, and after a week, using the Watch became second nature. Timekeeper The Watch comes with 10 faces preloaded, and each can be adjusted to varying degrees. There's also a creation engine that lets you make and save variations of those faces for quick access. To swap or tweak one, you'll need to utilize Force Touch, Apple's recently introduced tech that enables the Watch's display (and the new MacBook's trackpad) to distinguish a light tap from a hard press. Jamming your finger into the screen isn't necessary, but you do need to apply significant pressure for the Watch to recognize what you're trying to do. Upon force pressing, the Watch gives you a horizontal carousel of the available faces. Swiping left and right gets you where you want to go, and any faces that can be customized have a button telling you so beneath them. Tap that button, and again, swiping right and left navigates the modes of adjustment. There are two main ways to tailor the faces: first, color. Wind the crown from top to bottom, and the hue of the words, numbers and watch hands change from salmon pink, to purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red and finally, white. Next, you can adjust a series of widgets on the faces, called complications in watchmaking parlance. Depending upon the face chosen, you've got three to five complications to work with. Tapping on a given widget lets you change it, and turning the crown rolls through the options. These include: date, calendar events, moon phase, sunrise and sunset times, weather, stocks, activity summary, alarm, timer, stopwatch, battery charge and world clock. Fans of simplicity can also turn any and all complications off. Additionally, the Motion face lets you choose among beautiful animations of different butterflies, flowers or jellyfish, while the Chronograph lets you change the watch face itself to black, navy, brown, forest green, dark gray or parchment color. Two of the faces I found most appealing, Solar and Astronomy, don't support such modding. They are, however, interactive and dynamic. Astronomy lets you swap among views of the Earth, the moon and the solar system (and spinning the crown lets you zoom forward and backward in time, spinning the celestial bodies and the sun's shadow accordingly). Solar displays the sun's position in the sky via a parabolic arc and horizon line and similarly, rotating the crown slides it along that arc. As it does so, the corona emanating from the sun changes to emulate the lighting of dawn, dusk, high noon and all other times before and after solar midnight. Communicator Some notifications on the Watch are actionable -- such as archiving Gmail messages -- though most are simply informational. Each is accompanied by a short pop or ding and/or a bit of haptic feedback. Both the sounds and vibrations can be turned on and off individually to suit your tastes or differentiate between types of notifications. Should you miss an alert when it first comes through, the next time you check the Watch, a small red dot appears on screen (or not, if you choose to turn that feature off) letting you know. A swipe down puts you in the notification tray, and if you want to dismiss all of them at once, a simple Force Touch does the trick. Plenty of others have complained about a lack of granular controls for notifications, but I didn't find it to be a problem. Really, having notifications mirror behavior from the iPhone or simply switching them off was all the control I needed. It's just a matter of figuring out what sorts of pings you want on your wrist: either just the important stuff, or the full fire hose of digital info. You can make and take phone calls, send and receive text messages or use Apple's Watch-specific Digital Touch comms technology to send finger paintings, taps, animated emoji and even a facsimile of your heartbeat to your closest friends. Using the Watch to take calls is a middling-to-poor experience, though being able to mute an incoming call by covering the Watch is a handy feature. In a quiet, private place, it's a \"good enough\" sort of thing, with mediocre audio at limited volume being pumped out of the Watch's speaker. In public? Forget about it. Aside from the obvious lack of privacy and inconsiderate nature of forcing those around you to endure your conversation, you can't hear what the person on the other end is saying when there's any sort of ambient noise. The novelty of talking and listening to my wrist dissipated after just a few calls. Messaging is, by far, the most useful of the Watch's communication abilities. Using the app, you can receive, reply to and send texts, and Apple's made replying to messages, in particular, even easier than on an iPhone. See, the Watch provides a list of (mostly) contextually relevant replies you can simply tap to use instead of typing out a response. You can also use Siri to dictate text replies or send audio messages -- the voice dictation mostly works well, but plenty of times, there's an interminable delay (sometimes of 15 seconds or more) between when I'd speak my reply and when Siri would recognize it. Still, I found messaging via the Watch a feature worth having, as it was often more convenient to deal with texts there than on my phone. Apple's made much ado about its Digital Touch technology, which, in theory, provides a more personal way to communicate. The tech enables you to tap, draw pictures or scribble words on the Watch screen and have it mirrored on your friend's Watch, even if it's a world away. You can also send your heartbeat by pressing and holding two fingers against the screen for a few seconds. In order to digitally touch someone, they also need to be added to your Friends circle in the iPhone app. In practice, I found it difficult to find the appeal of this mode of communication. I'm a poor artist; my handwriting looks like chicken scratch; and nobody would ever accuse me of being a romantic. Plus, I only had a couple of other Watch owners available in my contacts with which to experiment. Fitness and health tracker Despite my svelte frame, I'm no workout warrior. In fact, I'm one of the laziest people I know. (I will not apologize for this. Gormans are naturally a tall and skinny people.) Because of this, I greatly appreciate Apple's multi-pronged, relatively frictionless approach to activity tracking. When first firing up the app, it prompts you to input your sex, age, weight, height and general activity level in terms of daily calorie burn. The app uses this information to recommend daily movement and exercise goals that can be adjusted manually as well. The app tracks you three ways using the Watch's accelerometer: Move, Stand and Exercise. The aim is to give a comprehensive look at your daily activity and motivate you to stop being such a slothful meatbag. Move is a calorie counter. Stand tracks how sedentary you are on an hourly basis (and prompts you to get up for at least one minute out of every hour). Exercise keeps up with how much time you've spent on any activity as or more strenuous than a brisk walk, with the aim of getting 30 minutes of exercise each day. I can't say the Activity app has made me become more active, yet, but it has made me mindful of my activity level (or lack thereof) -- and therefore I aspire to be more active. Baby steps, right? There's also a separate, more comprehensive Workout app that integrates with the Activity app. The app lets you choose from a set list of types of exercise (walking, biking, elliptical, rowing machine, etc.). It uses that information, plus the accelerometer and heart rate sensor in the Watch, along with the GPS and WiFi in your iPhone to measure distance covered and (if you have an iPhone 6) elevation gained and lost. All those elements working in concert enable the Watch, according to Apple, to compute a more accurate estimate of your calorie burn during workouts. Navigation, payments, music and more There are a few other miscellaneous features of the Watch that are of particular value, I found. First among these is Maps. Issues with Apple Maps itself aside, the implementation of it on the Watch is quite useful, especially when used in tandem with the iPhone. While you can search for locations using Siri on the Watch, I found it preferable to map my routes using my phone and then let the Watch handle telling me where to go. It does so with visual cues and haptic feedback. The tap pattern is different for right and left turns, though apparently my tactile perception is pretty weak at this point. I've yet to tell the two apart by feel alone. I imagine they will become easier to differentiate as I grow attuned to the sensations. Apple Pay is also, of course, a part of the Watch experience. You add credit cards through the iPhone Watch app -- and even if your iPhone already has Pay activated, you'll need to re-add your card for the Watch -- and you must have a four-digit Watch passcode enabled. Using Pay is easy. Once you're set up, press the lone button on the Watch twice and your available credit cards pop up on screen. Choose the one you want; hold your wrist near the reader until you hear the beep; and you're good to go. The Watch also lets you store up to 2GB or about 250 songs on board, though you'll need a Bluetooth speaker or headphones to actually, you know, listen to those tunes. Lastly, a word about third-party Watch apps. I've only tried a handful of the over 3,000 available, but the ones I have used are buggy and slow. I'm chalking this up to them being built for a wholly new software platform and developers need some time to optimize them. I therefore don't find it necessary or useful to spend time evaluating them here. I will say that it bodes well for Apple to have such a huge catalog of apps at launch, and I expect to see more and better software in the months to come. Battery life I'll admit, coming into this review, I expected that having to charge the Watch nightly would be a chore. I was wrong. Because of the nifty magnetic induction-charging disc and the fact that I'd never sleep wearing a Watch anyway, charging it up each night just isn't a big deal. (Though having to pack one more charging cable in my bag when I travel is certainly an irritation). As for battery life, well, I've made it through every day with at least 15 percent and sometimes over 50 percent of charge left when I hit the sack. Most importantly, I never once found myself worrying about the Watch running out of juice and never had to use the power reserve mode (which turns the Watch into a timepiece only) to make it through the day. Do I wish that the thing could last for days or weeks without a charge? Of course I do, but state of the art for smartwatch battery life is no more than a day -- maybe two -- and the Watch is in line with that despite packing a 205mAh battery just two-thirds the size of most of its competitors. The competition Mostly, the Watch's competition comes from a plethora of Android Wear devices. When comparing software, the Watch does most everything that Wear does and more. Sure, Google Now 's contextual suggestions and voice recognition give it an edge over Siri, but the Watch's customizable faces, with their nifty complications, are far more useful. Plus, Dick Tracy fans are sure to love the Apple timepiece's abilities as a phone. Yes, Samsung's Gear S also makes calls, and matches the Watch Sport's $350 price, but it's huge, ugly and lacks app support due to its devotion to Tizen. The Moto 360 ($180) and LG G Watch R ($249) appeal to the circular-watch crowd, but both are masculine in appearance and are too chunky for those with feminine or dainty wrists. ASUS' ZenWatch is only $200 and comes closest to the Apple Watch in terms of attractive design, but its massive screen bezel takes away from an otherwise handsome stainless steel body. Really, if you're smartwatch shopping, it boils down to the age-old question about the phone in your pocket: iOS or Android? Because if you want a Watch, you better be comfy as a resident in Apple's walled garden. Wrap-up I don't think the Watch is for me. While I appreciate the thoughtfulness, quality and ingenuity of the hardware design, it's just not my style. Also, getting a Watch means locking one's self into an iPhone universe, and while it's an excellent handset, I harbor an affinity for Android phones. Plus, I rely heavily upon Google calendar and Gmail web apps both for work and personal purposes. Because of that, I can't take full advantage of the Watch's capabilities without switching to Apple's calendar and email client. And that's not happening. However, there are plenty of folks picking up what Apple's putting down, as evidenced by the estimated million Watch pre-orders Apple received. It's a well-rounded wearable that handles notifications as well as any other smartwatch, has comprehensive activity tracking skills and the cachet of being the hottest device on the planet (for now). If you're firmly on team iPhone, are willing to pay a premium for an intelligent timepiece and can handle charging it on a nightly basis, the Watch is for you. The bottom line is: The Watch is the nicest smartwatch available, but it's more status symbol than wearable revolutionary. Most of the Watch's features can be categorized as nice to have (at best) or superfluous (at worst), and because of that, if you're not enamored with the Watch's appearance, it's probably not compelling enough to buy one.

Last year's Surface Pro 3 was the software giant's most compelling implementation yet of its hybrid laptop/tablet concept. Now we have the Surface 3, the third entry in its cheaper Surface lineup. And while it may look similar to its predecessors, it's actually a completely different beast. It's a $499 Surface tablet that can actually run all of the Windows programs you're used to, not just Windows 8 apps. And to Windows RT, the stripped down version of Microsoft's OS that previously powered the non-Pro Surface tablets, all I have to say is: So long, goodbye. Don't let the door hit you on the way out! By giving up on Windows RT, Microsoft has finally managed to make a decent cheap Surface. Gallery | 19 Photos Microsoft Surface 3 review + See all 19 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 79 Microsoft Surface 3 Pros The lightest Surface yet Extremely versatile as both a tablet and laptop Runs all Windows software Stylus support is a nice bonus Cons Keyboard is another $130 Entry model has only 2GB RAM Not powerful enough for anything beyond basic computing Summary Microsoft's Surface 3 is the purest distillation of its hybrid tablet/laptop concept yet. It packs in a healthy amount of functionality for its $499 price, though be ready to pay another $130 for its keyboard. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware No, there aren't any major surprises when it comes to the Surface 3's hardware. It has the same silver magnesium alloy case with smooth chamfered edges, which gives it a smooth, premium feel in your hands. And of course, there's the iconic kickstand, which can now click into three positions, one step beyond the Surface 2. It's not nearly as versatile as the Surface Pro 3's fully customizable kickstand (which has no distinct positions), but it's enough to make the Surface 3 fit comfortably on your lap in many different orientations. This time around there's also support for Microsoft's pressure-sensitive stylus, something that's always been available on the Surface Pro series, but never the plain Surface line. Don't take my lack of surprise as a negative, though -- the Surface 3 is still incredibly well-designed, with an attention to detail you don't find on most laptops and tablets. Even today, after testing all five previous Surface devices over the past few years, I'm still impressed with Microsoft's craftsmanship. Now that it's finally running software you'd actually want to use, the Surface 3 might make more people recognize Microsoft's design chops. On a purely hardware level, the Surface 3 is the fullest realization of Microsoft's original Surface dream: a portable tablet that can do double-duty as a laptop. It features a new Intel Atom x7 processor, which lets it run traditional Windows apps, unlike the previous Tegra 4 chip. At 1.37 pounds and 0.34 inch thick, the Surface 3 is also a tad lighter and thinner than the Surface 2, which clocked in at 1.49 pounds and 0.35 inch thick. The two tablets still feel very different, though. The Surface 3 adopts the 3:2 screen aspect ratio from the Surface Pro 3 for its 10.8-inch screen, which makes it resemble a sheet of paper more than the wide 16:9 displays on previous Surfaces. And while that means the Surface 3 will show black bars when watching movies, the new proportions make it far more balanced to hold as a tablet. The previous Surface's wide screen just felt more awkward when held in one hand -- especially in portrait mode. The Surface 3 might make more people recognize Microsoft's design chops. Compared to the 1.76-pound Surface Pro 3, the Surface 3 is noticeably lighter and better-suited to being used as a tablet. But the Pro model makes for a much better ultraportable laptop, given its vastly superior hardware. That's to be expected, but it's a reminder that anyone considering the Surface 3 needs to think hard about how, exactly, they plan to use it. #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-454998{display:none;} .cke_show_borders #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-454998, #postcontentcontainer #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-454998{width:570px;display:block;} try{document.getElementById(\"fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-454998\").style.display=\"none\";}catch(e){} Alongside the Surface 3's edges, you've got a full-sized USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, headphone jack and a micro-USB port for charging (no more proprietary cables!). And of course, there's the usual power button and volume rocker, as well as a microSD card slot underneath the kickstand (something Microsoft's included in past models). Again, there aren't many surprises, but I grew to appreciate the Surface 3's ability to charge over micro-USB. While it comes with a USB power adapter, you can also plug the Surface 3 into just about any micro-USB charger (or even another device with a USB port). Unless you trek out into the middle of nowhere, there's little chance you'd find yourself stranded without the ability to juice up the Surface 3. If you're the type who enjoys taking photos with your tablets -- something I'll never understand -- you'll be pleased to know the Surface 3 also sports a new 8-megapixel rear camera. That's a step up from the 5MP shooter on the Surface 2, which we found to be fairly disappointing in our review. There's also a 3.5MP front-facing camera, which should be far more useful. Once again, you'll have to buy one of Microsoft's $130 Type Covers separately if you actually want a keyboard. And, let's face it, there's no reason why you'd want to buy the Surface without the Type Cover. Since the beginning, Microsoft's positioned its unique keyboards as expensive accessories -- because the Surface is, after all, a tablet. The problem with that logic, though, is that Microsoft also wants it to be seen as a laptop replacement. And trying to sell a laptop without a keyboard is like trying to sell a car without a steering wheel (no, Google's self-driving cars don't count). It's just not going to happen. Microsoft is so eager to compete with the iPad's price that it's practically lying to consumers about the Surface's true cost. That may have been excusable at the start -- maybe -- but at this point it just feels gross. Trying to sell a laptop without a keyboard is like trying to sell a car without a steering wheel. Just like before, the Surface 3's Type Covers latch onto the tablet with a strong magnetic clip. But, taking another cue from its bigger brother, it also angles up slightly, which makes it more stable while on your lap. Microsoft has created a new Type Cover to fit the Surface 3's smaller frame, but you can also attach any of the previous Surface keyboard cases if you've got them lying around (though they will hang over the tablet's edges a bit). There's no new Touch Cover (which doesn't have physical keys) for the Surface 3, which may be a sign Microsoft is ready to give up on that whole concept. But given just how thin and capable it's been able to make the Type Cover, I don't expect anyone will mourn the inevitable death of the Touch Cover. Gallery | 26 Photos A look at the Microsoft Surface 3 + See all 26 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Even though the Surface 3's Type Cover is smaller than the Pro version, I found it easy to type on, with a decent amount of feedback from the keys. It's slightly more difficult to balance on your lap when it's connected to the Surface 3, but it was still comfortable enough for me to type up most of this review. Display and pen input Microsoft managed to cram some nice displays into the last round of Surface devices, and that trend continues with the Surface 3. It features a 10.8-inch LCD with a 1,920 x 1,280 resolution that's bright, crisp and colorful. It's not as sharp as the iPad Air 2's Retina screen, or the Quad HD screens in Samsung's Galaxy Tab S line, but it's a fine display for extended reading, photo viewing and even watching movies (I particularly enjoyed using the Surface 3 to catch up on my Comixology queue). But if you have issues reading small text, take note: The Surface 3's generous resolution will make some websites and programs hard to use. Be prepared to bump up the text size in your system settings and browser. As is usually the case with LCDs, the Surface 3's display fares well indoors, but loses its luster outdoors. It's still usable -- you can easily make out text and photos -- but you'll have to get through plenty of reflectivity to get anything done. It's hard to fault the Surface too much when this is a problem you'll face with most tablets and laptops, even those significantly more expensive. For what it's worth, the Surface Pro 3 performs much better in direct sunlight. It makes a strong case for including pressure-sensitive stylus support in more tablets. For the artistic crowd, adding support for the Surface Pen is a wise move. It's the same stylus that's included with the Surface Pro 3, and it relies on that device's N-trig digitizer. Unfortunately, Surface 3 users have to shell out an additional $50 to get it, but since it's a fairly niche product, it makes sense for Microsoft to keep it separate. After pairing it over Bluetooth, you can click the top button of the Surface Pen to open up a new OneNote file and start scribbling your thoughts. Click it again, and it gets sent to your OneDrive cloud storage. And just as with the Surface Pro 3, you can even wake up the computer from sleep by clicking the Pen's top button, which brings you right to a blank OneNote page. When it comes to putting the Pen to the screen, the Surface 3 feels about as good as its Pro sibling. That is to say, it's a pretty smooth experience. There wasn't much lag between hitting the screen and getting something to show up, and there's a decent amount of paper-like resistance against the screen. It certainly won't make you forget you're drawing on glass, but it makes a strong case for including pressure-sensitive stylus support in more tablets. The biggest problem with the Surface Pen? There's no place to hold it on the Surface 3. The Type Cover for the Surface Pro 3 at least gives you a slot to tuck the Pen away.

They were perpetually underpowered, but their diminutive size and cheap price made them ideal for being secondary portable computers. So I was surprised at just how capable the quad-core Atom x7-Z8700 chip in the Surface 3 is. It runs at 1.6GHz, but it can bump up to 2.4GHz in bursts. The Atom x7, which was announced at Mobile World Congress, also balances that speed with intelligent power management. Because of that, the Surface 3 doesn't even need a fan to stay cool. Overall, the Atom x7 feels like a step up from the previous generation of Atom processors we see in Chromebooks. I was able to run Firefox and Chrome, both with multiple windows and plenty of tabs, along with Spotify and Skype without any significant slowdown. Launching new apps felt speedy, and I didn't have any issues moving between the apps and swiping around Windows 8's interface. The only thing I had to keep an eye on was complex web apps like TweetDeck eating up too much RAM in Chrome -- but that's something I also have to deal with on my desktop and MacBook Air. And as you can tell from the benchmarks above, the Surface 3's disk speeds can't compare to more powerful laptops, so it won't be much of a media-creation machine. Mostly, I enjoyed the fact that I could use the Surface 3 like a normal Windows computer. I wasn't restricted to Windows 8 apps and pre-installed Office apps like the Surface 2 and Surface RT, and that goes a long way toward making it more useful. I missed simple things on the Surface 2, like the speediness of Chrome, my library of Steam games and editing photos quickly with Paint.Net. As a tablet, the Surface 3 was easy to hold as I caught up on Saga with the Windows 8 Comixology app. Microsoft's OS still holds back it's true tablet potential, though -- there still aren't many great Windows tablet apps, and using the Surface in tablet mode on the desktop is as awkward as ever. The Surface 3 has its limits, of course -- 4K YouTube streams were a stuttery mess, and it's not nearly powerful enough to run graphics-hungry games. But that's no surprise since it's toting an Atom chip. And since the Surface 3's screen tops out at just above 1080p, you won't be viewing 4K files on it anyway. Gone Home, a first-person indie game that doesn't need much horsepower, loaded up quickly, but it was only playable at a 720p resolution. And even then, it was still kind of choppy. 4K YouTube streams were a stuttery mess, and it's not nearly powerful enough to run graphics-hungry games. My experience with the Surface 3 might be much different than yours, though. Microsoft sent me the $599 model with 4GB of RAM -- the bare minimum you'd want in any computer these days -- and 128GB of storage. The entry-level $499 Surface 3 only has 2GB of RAM, which means it'll be far less capable when it comes to juggling multiple apps. Given just how cheap RAM is these days, you'd think Microsoft would just bite the bullet and include more memory by default. The Surface 2 performed decently with only 2GB of RAM, though, but that machine couldn't run traditional memory-hungry Windows software. On the storage front, the Surface 3 is a significant upgrade over its predecessor, which only offered 32GB and 64GB options. The Surface 3's 64GB and 128GB options are far more palatable for an actual computer -- you'll have room for a slew of programs, as well as music and video files. Tablet Battery Life Microsoft Surface 3 9:11 Microsoft Surface 2 14:22 iPad Mini 3 13:45 Dell Venue 8 7000 series 12:11 HP Spectre x360 11:34 iPad Air 2 11:15 Microsoft Surface RT 9:36 Nexus 9 9:10 Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 8:56 Sony Xperia Tablet Z 8:40 HP Stream 8:17 Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro 7:36 HP Slate 7 7:36 Microsoft Surface Pro 3 7:08 Samsung Chromebook 2 (11-inch) 7:00 HP SlateBook x2 6:34 (tablet only) / 8:49 (keyboard dock) Microsoft claims you'll get around 10 hours of battery on the Surface 3, which is more than the nine hours and 11 minutes I saw in our standard battery test (looping an HD video at 65 percent brightness until it loses power). That's a big step down from the Surface 2, which lasted a whopping 14 hours and 22 minutes in our tests. Still, it was able to keep up with me for most of a workday, starting at 9 AM and finally losing charge around 4 PM. Configuration options and the competition On top of the 64GB $499 and 128GB $599 options, there are also LTE-equipped Surface 3 models on the horizon starting at $599 with 64GB of storage. But don't forget, you've also got to add the $130 Type Cover if you want a keyboard and another $50 for the stylus. That puts the entry level Surface 3 at $680 with all of its accessories. And, for the first time, there's also a $200 docking station for the low-end Surface, which includes four USB ports, a Mini DisplayPort, and Gigabit Ethernet. Sure, the Surface 3 could be seen as an iPad Air 2 competitor. They start at the same price (sans the Type Cover), and they're both aiming at the 10-inch tablet market. But you could just as easily see it as a more functional alternative to mid-range Chromebooks like Samsung's $400 Chromebook 2, which can only run apps within Google's Chrome browser. It's also a more powerful option than cheap Windows laptops like HP's $200 Stream, which are the centerpiece of Microsoft's plan to take on Chromebooks. And, of course, the Surface 3 is basically just a stripped-down version of the Surface Pro 3, which starts at $799 without a Type Cover (though you'd likely end up spending around $1,000 if you bump up the specs). As I mentioned above, you should think hard about how you're going to use the Surface 3 before committing. If you just want a cheap web-browsing computer, go for a Chromebook instead. If you're mainly concerned about getting the best tablet experience, get the iPad Air 2. And if the Surface 3 sounds underpowered, consider saving up for the Surface Pro 3 (or its eventual successor, which could land in the next few months). Wrap-up I can't recommend the Surface 3 to everyone, but it's the first $499 Surface that I can recommend to someone. And that's more than I can say for the Surface 2 and RT. It's a machine that's capable of doing a lot -- within limits. And come the eventual Windows 10 upgrade, which will be freely available to all Windows 7 and 8 users later this year, it will only get better. I can't recommend the Surface 3 to everyone, but it's the first $499 Surface that I can recommend to someone. Even if it's not for you, the Surface 3 shows that Microsoft's vision of a single device that can serve as both tablet and laptop isn't a mere pipe dream. The company is learning from its mistakes -- ahem, Windows RT -- and it's continually doubling down on what makes the Surface lineup great. The big problem for Microsoft? It still doesn't have a killer, must-buy Surface. And that leaves it open to being usurped. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: hybrid tablets, microsoft, mobilepostcross, review, Surface, Surface 3, tablets, video \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21172606 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21172606\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/microsoft/surface/3/\"> Microsoft Surface 3 </a> Microsoft Surface 3 64GB 128GB LTE Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/microsoft/surface/3/\" title=\"Microsoft Surface 3 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 2 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Tablet Operating system Windows (8.1) Screen size 10.8 inches Storage type Internal storage (64 GB, Flash), Memory card Camera (integrated) 8\u00a0megapixels Maximum battery life Up to 10 hours Released 2015-05-05 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Features 10 Display 9 Battery life 8 Ease of use 9 Storage capacity 8 Design and form factor 9 Portability (size / weight) 10 Durability 9 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

To add steam to the Alcatel OneTouch Watch hype train, the company's design brass went as far as telling our own Richard Lai that the company's gunning to be the Zara of the wearable world. Not a style guru? Essentially, Alcatel's been trying to cook up a fashion-forward smartwatch without a price tag that'll make your wallet groan. At $150, I'd argue the end result fulfilled the latter half of that equation more than the former, but the bigger question is whether Alcatel's first attempt at a wearable (running its own homebrew software, no less) is actually worth a damn. Well, after having spent a full week with the Watch lashed to my wrist, I'm unconvinced. Gallery | 36 Photos Alcatel OneTouch Watch review + See all 36 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 64 Alcatel OneTouch Watch Pros Works with iOS and Android Impressive battery life USB charging port built into strap $150 isn't terrible for a smartwatch Cons Wrist strap is\u00a0hefty, uncomfortable Sometimes struggles to stay connected May never get third-party apps Summary This is Alcatel OneTouch's first stab at making a smartwatch, and it's obvious the company's not drawing from a vast pool of experience. Despite the goal of delivering a polished, attractive smartwatch with a reasonable price tag, the Alcatel OneTouch Watch feels eagerly amateurish at best and just poorly thought out at worst.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware It's usually only high-end smartwatches that get circular screens, but Alcatel's eager to prove you don't have to shell out gobs of cash for a wearable that looks like a traditional watch. It's not hard to see where the company cribbed its design cues from, either. From the round body hewn partially of stainless steel, to the occlusion that obscures the bottom of the 1.2-inch screen, to the single crown button lodged on the right edge, the Watch looks more than a little like the Moto 360. I can't fault Alcatel for those external similarities -- the 360 is easily one of the most attractive wearables out there -- but the design team dropped the ball on a few key details that kept the Watch from looking and feeling as nice as it could. The design team dropped the ball on a few key details that kept the Watch from looking and feeling as nice as it could. Take that chassis for instance. I dig the mostly metal build and the fact that it's water- and dust-resistant up to the IP67 standard, but the rear of the Watch's body is made of chintzy, easily marred black plastic. Hardly a dealbreaker, but it feels cheap and out of place here. It'll sound a little persnickety, but the font Alcatel used to highlight the 12 and 6 o'clock hours is really bothersome too. I can't quite place what typeface it used, but my gut says it's something incredibly generic like Arial Black. What really gets me is that a slightly crisper, classier face (or even just a typeface change) would've made the Watch look so much more sophisticated -- instead, it feels like Alcatel phoned this part in. What's worse, the strap is just lousy. My review unit came with a stiff, dark gray resin band with red trim (there's also a fetching white model up for pre-order), and hardly anything about it'll make you want to wear it for any serious amount of time. The dense material makes for some sweaty, uncomfortable wrists, and the locking clasp you'll use to adjust the band's fit is both initially confusing and tricky to open unless you've got sturdy nails. Thing is, the band also doubles as the Watch's charging system so there's no way to swap it for something a bit more comfortable. Forget separate cables or wireless charging docks -- the end of that rigid plastic strap flips up to reveal a full-size USB jack that slips into your laptop or wall charger, like one of Nike's old FuelBands. I've been wondering if we'd ever see this in a proper smartwatch, but the stiffness of the jack makes it really hard to slip the fastening loop over it. That wouldn't be such a big deal if the charging end of the wristband wasn't so prone to popping loose when that fastener isn't firmly holding it in place. Sigh: a great idea marred by poor execution. It's not all bad, though, I promise. The Watch is powered by an STMicroelectronics STM429 chipset and a surprisingly long-lasting 210mAh battery keeps things humming along (the Moto 360 has a 320mAh battery, for comparison'). The screen, while relatively low-res at 240 x 204, is bright enough to withstand some harsh spring sunlight. I'd have loved to see an ambient or auto-brightness mode that kicked the screen into a low-power state so I didn't have to paw at a button whenever I wanted to see the time, but Alcatel was clearly keeping costs down. Even so, there's a gyroscope, altimeter, accelerometer, heart rate monitor and an NFC radio lurking in that 10.5mm thick body; would adding a light sensor really have been that difficult? Software Alcatel's body of work is made up mostly of Android smartphones, so it was a surprise to hear that the company didn't throw Android Wear on its first smartwatch. Instead, it runs a proprietary OS that, while intentionally limited in functionality, still manages to play nice with both iOS and Android devices running the simplistic OneTouch Move companion app. I spent my week with the Watch (come up with the catchier name next time, y'all) paired alternately with an iPhone 6 and a Galaxy S6 Edge, and to its credit, it performed just as well on one as it did on the other. Granted, sometimes that meant the Watch was equally lame on both platforms, but hey -- at least it was consistent. Sometimes that meant the Watch was equally lame on both platforms, but hey -- at least it was consistent. Once you fire up the Watch for the first time and blaze through the dead-simple setup process, you're left looking at, well, the time. Pressing and holding the watch face brings up a selection screen that gives you three total choices: a digital readout, a minimalist analog display and a slightly more ornate analog look with on-screen hour indicators that reach out to touch the ones painted directly on the face. You'd be right to think that's not very thrilling, but digging into the companion app lets you swap background colors and images for a little extra character. The colorful grid of app icons you'll swipe through after tapping on the display is almost reminiscent of Windows 8's Start Screen, but only about half of them actually count as apps -- the rest are system settings like screen brightness and airplane mode that didn't get lumped into a separate menu. And the rest? The weather app gives you current conditions plus high and low temperatures for the next five days, while an included activity tracker monitors your daily step counts and calories burned. You can measure your heart rate, use the Watch as a compass or stopwatch, locate your phone and even control music playing on your handset. All pretty de rigueur for a smartwatch these days. Meanwhile, swiping up from the bottom of the screen opens a notification shade and, tapping on the \"6\" brings you back to where you just were. And, well, that's all the thing does. At the time of writing, there is no extensibility, no extra software you can install, nothing to help the Watch weasel its way into your life. Alcatel spokespeople said back at CES that they were seeding devices to developers in an effort to jumpstart development of fresh, new apps, but we'll have to wait and see how that shakes out. There's good reason to don your skeptic hat, though -- if a developer needs to devote time and energy to making a killer app for a wearable platform, you'd better believe it'll be one people have already embraced. The whole iOS/Android agnosticism thing is great in that it potentially doubles Alcatel's market for the Watch, but I wonder how many app makers will bother giving this thing a shot. In use I realize I've been harsh on this thing so far, but know this: Questionable design aside, the Watch does most of what it set out to do without too much fuss. Using a doodad on your wrist to count steps can be tricky, but watching the counter tick upward in time with my steps down Broadway was reassuring... even if the count was several hundred steps off compared to the Withings Activit\u00e9. That's no great sin though -- there's plenty of motivational value in a \"broad strokes\" look at your movement. Speaking of tricky, heart rate monitors can be iffy when you cram them into smartwatches and the Watch is no exception. I could be sitting dead still and breathing normally, but my readings would jump from 62 beats per minute to 145 within the span of a minute or two. Cheapo sensor, or heart attack waiting to happen? My money's on the former. To my utter shock, using the Watch as a remote shutter button for my phone's camera was the simplest, most impressive trick Alcatel brought to the table. The interface consists of a single button to snap a photo and it just worked every time. Bravo. Just forget about changing focus from your wrist, though. Too bad the built-in music-control app doesn't fare nearly as well. Cycling through tracks with a quick left or right swipe is simple enough, but waiting for the volume level to catch up to where my finger was placed took ages. When everything's synced up properly, the experience can be almost peachy. The issue is, the Watch is pretty lousy at connecting to your phone again if you spend too long out of range. Actually, you don't even need to be all that far away -- I've seen it fumble the connection while sitting right next to my iPhone on a couch. Either way, you probably won't notice the problem until a blue bubble pops up on the display asking you to launch the OneTouch companion app again to re-forge the bond between devices. Oh, what's that? You were expecting an important message? Hope you weren't counting on your wrist to buzz, then. Occasionally, fetching an updated weather forecast will take so long you'll wonder why you didn't dig your phone out of your pocket to start with. When everything's synced up properly, the experience can be almost peachy. My beef extends well beyond just connectivity issues, by the way. The built-in accelerometer usually does a fine job of lighting up the screen when you bring your wrist up to your face, except when it just doesn't. It usually sorts itself out after a little while, but as I write this sentence, it's been over an hour since the motion-sensitive display feature stopped working and I have no idea why. I also spent one Sunday on an 11-mile traipse around town and racked up something like 23,000 steps. My phone died midway through the day and I thought nothing of it until I finally got the thing to a charger after midnight. All of the day's movement data? Nowhere to be found. Since there's no way to view information older than a day on the Watch itself, all of the ego-swelling statistics from that day seem to have disappeared forever. It's these little technological lapses that turn a potentially serviceable smartwatch into something that needs coddling. No thanks. If the Watch has a single saving grace, it's the 210mAh battery tucked away in there. Alcatel claims the average user can squeeze between two and five days out of the Watch before it needs to charge again, and thankfully that's roughly what I've seen over the past week. Even with brightness cranked all the way up and notifications pouring in like a tidal wave, I couldn't get the Watch to die before a full 48 hours had passed. Three to three and a half days was the average amount of time it took to fully kill this thing, and with a little forethought (and a lot of airplane mode), the Watch could easily hit four of five days before officially giving up the ghost. The competition The Watch is nothing if not a curious little beast, thanks to its cross-platform predilections and more-or-less \"premium\" design. If you're not absolutely dying for a color screen, but still want a wearable that feels like something your grandfather and not your kid cousin would wear, consider the Pebble Steel. It's a touch more expensive at $199, but you get an e-paper display that'll sip on the battery for up to a week and a crazy amount of third-party apps and support. If you're willing to give up on iOS compatibility (for now, anyway) some of the less expensive Android Wear watches might be more up your alley. Google's online store dropped the price of a non-customized Moto 360 to $165 since a new one is very clearly hurtling toward store shelves, making it the cheapest Wear watch you can buy new in-box right now. It doesn't come close to delivering the sort of battery life I squeezed out of the Watch, but the huge boost in functionality makes it worth a nightly trip to a power outlet. On the flip side, if you're more concerned about owning a fitness-focused wristwatch that doesn't look like something out of a Playskool vision of the future, the $150 Withings Activit\u00e9 Pop should do nicely. What it lacks in features it makes up for with effortlessly good looks and a battery you won't have to worry about for months. Wrap-up Here's my smartwatch philosophy in a nutshell: The best ones do exactly what you need them to when you need them to, and then fade away into the background when it's all done. When everything works the way it's supposed to, Alcatel OneTouch's Watch manages to hit that threshold. It's not the most handsome, nor the most thoughtfully designed wearable, but at least its functional. Too bad, then, that the occasional moments of data loss, flaky connections and sometimes screwy basics make the Watch feel like something you have to take care of. Rather than adding convenience to your life, Alcatel's first wearable borders on being burdensome. I don't doubt that the company's ironing out some kinks and prepping firmware updates to clean up the experience down the line, but man -- talk about a lousy first impression. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: alcatel, alcatel onetouch, Alcatel OneTouch Watch, AlcatelOnetouch, onetouch, review, smartwatch, tcl, watch, wearable \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21172290 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21172290\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/alcatel-onetouch/watch/\"> Alcatel OneTouch Watch </a> Alcatel OneTouch Watch Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/alcatel-onetouch/watch/\" title=\"Alcatel OneTouch Watch reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 0 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Other Screen size 1.22 inches Dimensions 1.65 x 1.65 x 0.41 in Weight 2.12 oz Announced 2015-01-05 see all specs \u2192 There are not any reviews for this product yet.

If you needed any proof that those days are over, just a take peek at the Turbo's considerable heft and generous curves. This isn't one of those anorexic phones that some companies keep churning out, and that's a welcome change; after all, the Turbo's more ample dimensions are put to good use here. For one, they make the handset feel reassuring to hold, with that prominent curve helping the Turbo nestle into your palm. And the second, arguably more important reason? To accommodate those precious innards, which include a speedy quad-core 2.7GHz Snapdragon 805 chip, 3GB of RAM and that tremendous 3,900mAh battery (Motorola says it'll net you around 48 hours of continuous use on a charge, but we'll revisit that claim later on). Anyway, yes, the Droid Turbo feels great, except for maybe the gummy-feeling volume rocker/SIM tray combo. Too bad it doesn't look nearly as good. Between that wide swath of ballistic nylon and the teensy raised Droid logo on the phone's bum, the Turbo looks like miniature luggage from behind -- a Stuart Little-sized suitcase, if you will. The front is somehow even less visually interesting, though that changes when the 5.2-inch Quad HD screen comes alive. Other than that, though, there isn't much to look at: just a wide speaker grille sitting above the 2-megapixel front-facing camera, and the capacitive touch buttons baked into the bezel beneath the screen. Android purists might wail in favor of on-screen buttons, but they're plenty responsive and light up evenly when the going gets dim. The only other bit of flair is a slim band of shiny plastic that runs around the screen, though it has a nasty tendency to chip without much provocation. I'll be the first to admit my bag has plenty in common with a junkyard, but even storing it a few times in one of the emptier pockets was enough to mar the finish. Sure, this might not sound like a huge deal, but it's mighty obnoxious when the rest of the phone feels like it's meant to take a licking. Display and sound The Moto X and the Droid Turbo both sport 5.2-inch AMOLED screens, but that's where the similarities end (much to the chagrin of X owners, I'd wager). That's because the panel Motorola used on the Turbo runs at Quad HD (or 2,560 x 1,440, if you haven't already committed it to memory), making it one of the most pixel-dense displays you'll find on a smartphone. The effect, as you'd imagine, is pretty stunning. Your stories, your videos, your apps; they're going to look just lovely. That said, a screen like this will make you all too aware that the internet is peppered with low-res images and icons, so be ready to shield your eyes whenever you come across them. Skype is a good example of this visual discrepancy in action: Your messages will look crisp, while emoticons will be tiny since they're so low-res. At some point, though, you've got to wonder when (or even if) enough will be enough. Do all those extra pixels crammed into each linear inch really make a difference? We're getting to the point where the inability to distinguish one pixel from another is just a given, so all the other factors suddenly become more important. The Turbo's Super AMOLED panel, for instance, can oscillate between bright, punchy colors and sumptuous blacks. The downside is that images and video take on a slightly warm cast (Sutton Foster look distinctly tanned in one of my test videos), which won't be everyone's cup of tea. Viewing angles are solid too, if not the best I've come across, and even at maximum brightness, the Turbo's screen still doesn't light up the night with quite the same vigor as the Moto X. Ah, but here's the rub! That screen might lend itself well to your video collection, but the single-speaker setup isn't going to thrill you. Frankly, this part's a little frustrating -- even the budget-priced Moto G has a pair of front-facing speakers, while the clearly higher-end Turbo has to make do with one less driver. The end result is audio that's plenty loud, but cramped and muddy, without much distinction between channels. That's not to say the speaker's bad, per se; it's on par with most of the speakers in other smartphones, which is to say they get the job done and don't aspire to much more. Keep a pair of headphones handy and you'll never have to worry about it. Software If you've handled a Motorola phone in the past year, you've probably noticed that the company doesn't like futzing around with pure Android when it doesn't have to. Thankfully, that philosophy hasn't changed, so we're treated to almost the same, nearly stock version of Android 4.4.4 that graced the Moto X... except without the lovely Google Now Launcher preloaded. That also means Motorola's thoughtful add-ons like Moto Display and Moto Actions have made the leap to the Turbo, too, so waving your hand over a darkened screen will still give you a sense of who or what is trying to get your attention at any given moment. Always-on voice commands? Those are here too; I trained my Turbo to respond to, \"Hey Turbo, you there?\" and the system seems just as sensitive and responsive as ever. If you read my Moto X review, you'll know that in addition to helping the Turbo feel almost like an assistant waiting to do my bidding, Moto Voice is also a lifesaver when you occasionally forget where you put the thing. It was even eager enough for my voice that it responded from underneath a pile of gym clothes in my hamper, saving from it from a few rounds in the spin cycle. So what's actually different here? Uh, not much. The biggest addition to the mix is Motorola's Droid Zap feature (though iOS and Android users can download it from their respective app stores) -- the sorta-neat tool lets you fling photos and videos to people nearby or onto a Chromecast if you've got one hooked up. Droid owners can set up distinct regions called Zap Zones to speed up the sharing even more; once activated, you're basically broadcasting every photo you take to a pre-selected group of people. It's a neat enough tool (not to mention an easy one to use), but I just haven't been able to stick with it. After all, you've got to coax your buddies to download yet another iOS or Android app to really use the feature, and it's not like there's a shortage of ways to share photos anyway. Finally, of course, all of Verizon's trademark red bloatware is present and accounted for. You can expect to see 16 apps (some useful, some trash) taking up space in your app launcher, but you can at least disable them from the settings menu if you're itching to tidy up. Camera The Moto X's lackluster 13-megapixel camera might've been one of its biggest failings, and it's clear that Motorola wasn't about to let that happen again. That would explain why the Turbo instead packs a 21-megapixel rear shooter with a wide f/2.0 lens, a combination that's just utterly, staggeringly better than what its poor cousin has to offer. The full-resolution photos I snapped looked crisp and vivid, though not to the point where I'd worry the shots were technically inaccurate somehow. That said, low-light performance wasn't much to write home about -- smartphone cameras have historically been pretty lame when the lights start to dim and it wasn't long at all before I started noticing grain creeping into my shots. At least Motorola's HDR mode is surprisingly solid when it comes to eking a little extra depth and verve out of those dim photos. All told, though, the Droid Turbo produced livelier and more detailed shots than the Moto X, and occasionally captured a few shots I preferred over those I took with an iPhone 6 Plus. Gallery | 10 Photos Motorola Droid Turbo sample shots + See all 10 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Front-facing cameras are rarely anything to get fired up over, and the 2-megapixel shooter buried in the Turbo's forehead doesn't buck that trend. Your shots will be more than enough to swap on Instagram (or Tinder, if that's more your speed), but don't expect anything extravagant. On the plus side, the Turbo fares way better when it comes to video: The 1080p and 4K test footage I captured throughout the week was crisp, attractive and well-exposed, even if switching focus from one subject to another took a little bit of work. All that 4K video you're bound to start shooting looks great on the Turbo's hi-res screen, too. As you'd expect, Motorola's dead-simple interface is back in full effect, too. Haven't used it before? No worries: All it takes to snap a shot is a single touch on the screen, which is great for firing off photos in a jiffy. That does mean that the seemingly standard tap-to-focus action isn't enabled by default, so you'll probably want to swipe into the settings to handle that (or tweak your flash, HDR and resolution settings for that matter). Trust me: Unlike the Moto X before it, the Droid Turbo can focus on something new in a flash, so getting that extra bit of control to help it understand what to focus on is worth it. And if there's one potential issue with Motorola's camera app, it's that you might not have enough control -- still, that's nothing a quick trip to the Google Play store won't fix. Performance We'd be looking at one hell of an anticlimax if the Droid Turbo were a laggy piece of junk, but the thing definitely lives up to its name. I mean, of course it would. There's a 2.7GHz quad-core Snapdragon 805 running the show, paired with 3GB of RAM, an Adreno 420 GPU and a software stack that more or less stays out of the way (I can only imagine how buttery it'd feel running Android 5.0). I spent the past week trying to push this thing to the limit, by cooking up one obnoxious stress test after another, but I ultimately couldn't detect so much as a hint of lag or visual slowdown while flicking through menus, bouncing between open applications and popping in for a quick zombie smash in Dead Trigger 2... though that last bit does get the Turbo running a little warm. Make no mistake: The Turbo has enough oomph to take on anything else currently on the market, to say nothing of your to-do list. Oh, and in case you were curious, that long speaker grille up front helps make the thing perform well as an actual phone -- call quality was crisp and clear, though folks on the other end occasionally thought my voice sounded a little muffled. What more do you need? Oh, benchmarks? Here you go: Motorola Droid Turbo Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Moto X (2014) iPhone 6 Plus Quadrant 2.0 23,706 24,425 22,721 N/A Vellamo 3.0 3,803 1,808 2,093 N/A 3DMark IS Unlimited 20,030 20,692 19,568 17,902 SunSpider 1.0 (ms) 807 793 787 388 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 18.1 18.8 11.9 18.2 CF-Bench 48,861 43,234 39,018 N/A SunSpider: Lower scores are better. Unsurprisingly, the Turbo puts up numbers that are either in line with, or a notably better than, the Moto X did earlier this year. It goes round for round with Samsung's Galaxy Note 4 (which we collectively thought was the best big smartphone you can buy) too, but that's even less of a shock since they both have the same Qualcomm silicon thrumming away under the hood. Now, about that battery. Motorola likes to say you can squeeze a full 48 hours out of the Turbo on a single charge, and I don't doubt it. What really matters is the quality of that experience; after all, eking crazy longevity out of your phone doesn't mean much if you only get to use it as a glorified pocket watch. During my week of testing, the Turbo's battery routinely stuck with me for two full working days at a time, or about 18 hours of on-and-off phone calls, email replies, tweets, YouTube videos and the occasional Songza jam session. As someone who has to basically coddle his iPhone for most of the day, using the Turbo was a revelation: I could finally stop worrying about how much battery I had left to do something and instead just get it done. In our standard video stress test (say it with me: HD video looping indefinitely with screen brightness set to 50 percent), the Turbo stuck it out for just under 14.5 hours before it finally gave up the ghost. That's a good four hours more than what the Moto X could achieve, and a just over an hour more than what we got out the Galaxy Note 4 and its significantly smaller battery. And what happens when the Turbo does die? If you've got the included (and large) Turbo Charger handy, you can revive the battery and charge it nearly 20 percent in about 15 minutes. Motorola says that's enough to get you about eight hours of use before it bites the bullet again, a statement that my testing mostly jibes with. It all depends on how you use the phone, of course, but I spent closer to 10 hours using the Turbo as a mobile hotspot and checking the occasional Hangouts message with plenty of standby time in between.

Let's lead off with the most obvious alternative: the top-rated Moto X. What the thing lacks in battery and camera upgrades, it makes up for in sheer style; for a price, you can customize one to hell and back. Price is probably going to be a big consideration for you too since the base-level, 32GB Droid Turbo will run you $200, or double what the 16GB Moto X does. That gulf shifts a bit if you choose the wooden or leather finish for an extra $25, but we're still looking at a hefty difference between a great smartphone and its modified successor. Not a fan of the Turbo's hyper-masculine Droid aesthetic? Or Motorola in general? Fair enough. In that case, consider LG's G3: It too has a Quad HD screen (even if it's bigger and a hair less crisp at 5.5 inches), and the company carefully dialed back the high-octane obnoxiousness of its older software efforts. Performance hounds won't complain too much about the 2.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 chip, even if it's not quite as powerful as the Turbo for the same price. We were also big fans of Sony's Xperia Z3v, too -- it costs the same as the G3 and the Droid Turbo, and doesn't have the same brilliant screen as they do, but it's a powerful (and waterproof) package with a terrific camera to boot. And if you absolutely need an unlocked Droid Turbo, you could try scouting out a Moto Maxx. It's a nylon-clad, fully unlocked version of the Turbo so it's fully free of bloatware (and all of Verizon's garish red), but there's a rub: It's only technically available in Brazil and Latin America for now. Bummer? You bet, but I doubt that'll stop at least some of you from taking the plunge anyway. Wrap-up The Droid Turbo is frustrating. It's objectively better than the Moto X in most of the ways that matter: Its battery is tremendous (if not as amazing as Verizon claims); the screen is lovely; and the camera is actually worth using. Some might say this is the phone the Moto X should've been in the first place, and I can't argue with that. Still, as ridiculous as it sounds, the Turbo is severely lacking in the charm that made the X so pleasant, and that shouldn't be discounted. Go to a store. Play with both. You'll see what I mean. The fact that only Verizon customers can currently buy such a great phone doesn't help matters either. Here's what it boils down to: The Droid Turbo is an undeniably great device and probably the best carrier-exclusive phone since the days of, well, the original Motorola Droid. It won't win any awards for design or sound quality, but that won't make anyone who already bought a Moto X feel better. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: droid, droidturbo, mobilepostcross, motorola, review, turbo, uk-reviews, verizon, verizonwireless \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20990023 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20990023\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/droid/turbo/\"> Motorola DROID Turbo </a> Motorola DROID Turbo Buy from $149 * Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/droid/turbo/\" title=\"Motorola DROID Turbo reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 3 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android (KitKat [4.4]) Screen size 5.2 inches Internal memory 32 GB Camera 21\u00a0megapixels Carriers (US) Verizon / Alltel Released 2014-10-30 see all specs \u2192 9.3average user rating Reception and call quality 8.7 Display 10 Battery life 9.3 Camera 10 Ease of use 8 Design and form factor 9.3 Portability (size / weight) 9.3 Media support 9.3 Durability 9.3 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $149.99 on contract Buy now $649.99 + tax & shipping Buy now No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

That might make it sound like it's the third iteration in a line of gadgets, but really, it's the first. That's because even though this is Sony's third smartwatch (fourth if you count the Sony Ericsson LiveView), it's actually Sony's first that comes with Android Wear. Both the original SmartWatch and the SmartWatch 2 ran Sony's own proprietary platform, which, while Android-friendly, didn't have nearly the same reach as Google's Android Wear. It's great that Sony has finally seen the light, but the SmartWatch 3 has arrived remarkably late to the party, letting rivals like Motorola, LG and Samsung gain ground. On the other hand, the SmartWatch 3 is currently the only Android Wear option with a built-in GPS radio, allowing for more precise workout tracking. Which, as it turns out, could be enough to help Sony stand apart from the pack. Gallery | 31 Photos Sony Smartwatch 3 review + See all 31 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 76 Sony SmartWatch 3 Pros Built-in GPS is ideal for runners and other athletes WiFi and NFC make this more future-proof than other Android Wear devices Relatively long battery life Display is easy to read in direct sunlight Cons Drab design Screen isn't as vibrant as on some other smartwatches Not many Android Wear apps currently make use of the GPS, WiFi or NFC Summary Sony's latest smartwatch won't be for everyone, what with its dull design and muted screen. Still, this is currently the only Android Wear device with a built-in GPS radio, making it a smart choice for runners and other athletes interested in tracking their pace and distance. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware While some Android Wear watches like the Moto 360 and the ASUS ZenWatch make attempts at being stylish, Sony's SmartWatch 3 seems to have given up that notion entirely. Its square watch face, in combination with a rubber strap, definitely gives it more of a sporty, utilitarian look than a fashionable one. Worse still, the band that encapsulates the watch makes the 1.6-inch display seem larger than it is. Indeed, while the bezel surrounding the screen is relatively small, it appears so much thicker when worn in the strap, giving it an unfortunately chunky appearance. Yet, the fit is not altogether uncomfortable. The flexible strap is coated in what feels like a soft-touch velveteen material, and the weight of the core watch unit is only 39 grams (with the strap, it's about 66 grams). It's relatively easy to take on and off thanks to a simple metal clasp, which you can adjust to fit the size of your wrist. The watch might jostle around a bit when you're running, but on the whole I found it pleasant enough to wear on a daily basis. The SmartWatch 3's wrist strap comes in a few different colors: white, black, pink and green. To swap them out, simply push the watch unit out of its rubber enclosure; it should pop out without much effort. That's easy enough, but this does mean that the SmartWatch 3 isn't compatible with standard 22mm straps, so you're stuck with whatever bands Sony offers. Unlike a lot of other smartwatches, Sony's latest doesn't need a proprietary charging dock or cradle. It actually has a micro-USB port housed right in the watch itself, over on the backside, covered by a removable rubber stopper. Though portable charging docks generally contribute to slimmer and more streamlined designs, I actually really like that the watch has this built-in port. If it means not having to carry around yet another thing with me when I travel, I'm all for it. I do recommend popping the watch out of its rubber strap before plugging in the charging cable, however, because it's rather awkward otherwise. If you want the watch to survive a dunk in the pool, you should definitely keep that micro-USB port sealed. Once covered though, the SmartWatch 3 is IP68-rated for dust and water resistance, which means it can withstand submersion in up to 4.9 feet of water for 30 minutes. That's a touch better than the IP67 rating for most other watches like the Moto 360 and the LG G Watch R, which can supposedly be submerged in up to a meter (3.28 feet) of water for half an hour. Though you'll be doing most of your navigation via the watch's touchscreen display, the SmartWatch 3 does have a physical button on the side for when you need to quickly wake it up (or put it back to sleep). You can also hold it down as a shortcut to the Settings menu. The button sits slightly above the surface of the strap and has a nice give when pressed. Internally, the SmartWatch 3 makes use of a rather beefy 1.2GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor along with 512MB of RAM, plus 4GB of built-in storage so that you can load it with apps and music from Google Play. Other sensors include an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a compass. Of course, it also has Bluetooth, which you can use to pair with your phone, or connect to a set of headphones. As I noted earlier, the SmartWatch 3 is also the first Android Wear device to have built-in GPS, which I'll return to in much greater detail in just a moment. It's also said to have WiFi and NFC capabilities on board, but as Android Wear doesn't quite support those two functions just yet, I wasn't able to test them. Still, it's comforting to know that the SmartWatch 3 is future-proof in this regard -- something I can't say about most earlier Android Wear devices. Display While the design of the SmartWatch 3 might not exactly dazzle you with its style, its display is something else. It's not round like some of the fancier Android Wear options and it's a hair smaller too, but its clarity more than makes up for it. The 1.6-inch screen has a 320 x 320 resolution, which amounts to a pixel density of 283 ppi, making it one of the sharpest panels you'll find on any Android Wear device. I had no problems reading text, even on such a small display. I did, however, find the colors to be a bit muted and the whites to be a little yellow. Suffice it to say, it's not quite as stunning as the OLED screen we saw on the LG G Watch R. In exchange for some dull colors, though, a transflective LCD screen makes the SmartWatch 3 easy to view in direct sunlight. I left it on auto brightness most of the time, and thanks to the ambient light sensor, I was able to tell time and find out what song was playing with a quick glance, regardless of how bright it was outside. Like most other smartwatches, the SmartWatch 3 packs an internal accelerometer that lights up the screen whenever you lift it to meet your eyes. This, however, takes a second or so longer than I would like. Normally, this isn't a big deal, but when I was out and about, running errands, it got a little annoying.\nIn use In a sign that Sony is finally coming to its senses, the SmartWatch 3 is blessed with Android Wear and not some proprietary Sony operating system like its previous smartwatches. That means if you've read any of our reviews of previous Android Wear devices -- or maybe even own one yourself -- you probably already know how to use the SmartWatch 3. But perhaps you could use a refresher, so here's a brief primer. You'll need an Android phone to get started (obviously), at which point you'll need to download the Android Wear application. From there, it's just a matter of pairing the watch with the phone by following the onscreen instructions. Interestingly, I wasn't prompted at all to install any additional software like some of the other Android Wear watches (the Moto 360, for instance, requires Motorola Connect, while the ZenWatch wants you to have the ZenWatch Manager installed). As for navigating the watch itself, here's how it works: From the default watch face, you can swipe down to reveal the date, battery life information and gain quick access to mute, Theater Mode (where it shuts down the display) and the settings. Whenever you get a notification, you can swipe up take a peek, and then swipe right to dismiss it or left to get a further look at it. Pressing down on the default watch face lets you swap out different watch styles. It's all fairly intuitive and you should have no problems navigating it if you're at all familiar with smartphones. If you'd rather not go through the trouble of finger-swiping, you can also give voice commands thanks to the watch's built-in microphone. Simply say, \"OK Google,\" and it'll bring up a short list of eligible voice commands. You can tell it to do all kinds of things, like set a reminder, send a message or find directions, and it'll do so. Voice recognition can be a little spotty -- I sometimes had to repeat myself once or twice -- but it worked pretty well most of the time. As I mentioned up top, the most distinguishing feature of the SmartWatch 3 is that it's the first Android Wear device with built-in GPS. This is a very important feature for runners, who often like having GPS in their watches to track their distance, route and pace. In previous Android Wear devices, you still had to lug your phone around with you in order to get that geolocation data, which can be a pain if you want to run with as little burden on you as possible. The SmartWatch 3, on the other hand, lets you keep track of your run completely phone-free. Of course, this only really works if you use a running app that taps into the built-in GPS function of Android Wear. There aren't too many of these available right now, but thankfully one of the more popular ones, RunKeeper, updated its app to take advantage of it. I simply downloaded RunKeeper on my phone and it automatically synced the app to my watch. I then left the office to go on a brief walk, leaving my phone safely in my desk drawer. Before I took off, I told the RunKeeper app on the watch to start tracking the workout, and it did. When I came back and reconnected the watch with my phone, it automatically transferred the route, along with the pace and distance information, to the RunKeeper website. In short, the SmartWatch 3's GPS function works as advertised, and I can imagine it being a popular feature among runners and joggers. While the SmartWatch 3 also has a pedometer for counting steps, it curiously doesn't have a heart rate monitor like on the Moto 360 or ASUS ZenWatch. We've had mixed experiences with these optical heart rate sensors in the past, but omitting it completely in a supposedly sports-oriented watch seems like a big oversight. That said, the fact that the SmartWatch 3 includes two other uncommon features (WiFi and NFC) could make up for it. We just have to wait for the supported apps to arrive. Performance and battery life With a 1.2GHZ quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor along with 512MB of RAM, the SmartWatch 3 performs beautifully. I experienced little to no lag when navigating around the watch, and voice commands took no time at all to register. As I mentioned earlier, the accelerometer did seem a little slow to act when attempting to light up the watch with an elbow raise, but on the whole, performance was good. Battery life, however, is where the SmartWatch 3 really shines. It packs in a 420mAh battery, which is the biggest battery we've seen yet in an Android Wear watch. The rated longevity is somewhere around two days. In practice, I found this to be mostly accurate. I left notifications on for Twitter, Facebook and my calendar appointments; used GPS to track the occasional walking route; listened to a few songs on repeat (which I loaded onto the watch via Play Music); and used voice commands extensively throughout the day. The watch kept trucking along for about a day and half before it started begging to be plugged in. When I switched over to Airport Mode and kept the display off for the rest of the day, it lasted almost a full 48 hours. Under what I'd consider moderate to heavy use, that's quite impressive.\nThe competition The smartwatch space is getting increasingly competitive, which makes it all the more important for newcomers like the SmartWatch 3 to stand out. Thankfully, it does. It's certainly not as stylish as the Moto 360, LG G Watch R or ASUS ZenWatch, and it doesn't have the sort of unique circular display you'll find on the first two. At $250, the SmartWatch 3's price is priced on par with the competition too; the 360 and G Watch R cost $250 and $299, respectively, while the ZenWatch rings in at a more affordable $200. But what the SmartWatch 3 lacks in style, it makes up for in features. It has built-in GPS, which is great for runners and outdoor enthusiasts, and other goodies like WiFi and NFC mean that the SmartWatch 3 is far more future-proof than any of the other Android Wear devices on the market. Further, its battery life is relatively good, lasting a whole day longer than rivals like the ZenWatch and the Moto 360.\nWrap-up Sony's SmartWatch 3 certainly isn't for everybody. It's dull compared to its rounder, sexier rivals; its strap is made out of rubber rather than leather; and the display is not as bright or vibrant as others. But if you care more about function than form, the SmartWatch 3 suddenly looks a whole lot more interesting. For runners in particular, built-in GPS is a great feature that lets you leave your phone at home. It also has WiFi and NFC, making it more future-proof than the competition. It also eschews the need for a charging dock thanks to a built-in micro-USB port and has a battery life that makes it one of the longest-lasting smartwatches on the market. No, you shouldn't get the SmartWatch 3 if you want a watch to impress people at a cocktail party. But if you want one that's more suited for fitness, this is absolutely worthy of consideration. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android wear, androidwear, mobilepostcross, review, smartwatch, SmartWatch 3, smartwatch3, sony, sonysmartwatch3, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21123267 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21123267\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android-wear/\"> Google Android Wear </a> Google Android Wear Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android-wear/\" title=\"Google Android Wear reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Type Mobile / embedded OS Source model Open Released 2014-07-07 see all specs \u2192 7average user rating Ease of use 8 Speed 4 Configurability 2 Ecosystem (apps, drivers, etc.) 10 Openness 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 0 Moto 360 Pricing 0 Smartwatch that keeps the calendar locally? 2 Best Must Have Apps For Android Wear Talk about the Google Android Wear with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/sony/smartwatch/3/\"> Sony SmartWatch 3 </a> Sony SmartWatch 3 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/sony/smartwatch/3/\" title=\"Sony SmartWatch 3 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 2 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Other Operating system Android Screen size 1.6 inches Storage type Internal storage (4 KB, Flash) Released 2014-11-11 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Features 10 Display 8 Battery life 10 Ease of use 8 Storage capacity 9 Design and form factor 8 Portability (size / weight) 9 Durability 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 2 What running apps works with the GPS? 0 Smartwatch/Fitness band for snowboarding 2 Is the display Gorilla glass?

Even Apple, champion of the small screen, has finally caved to the trend. Over the past few years, however, some of the major smartphone players have taken to creating \"mini\" versions of their top handsets to satisfy those who still crave a smaller device. While these petite imitations benefit from shared design and branding, their hardware specifications are usually no match for the flagships they mimic. Sony does things a little differently, though, shunning the \"mini\" moniker and preserving as many high-end features as possible in its smaller devices. Case in point: the new Xperia Z3 Compact, which crams the best of the 5.2-inch Z3 into a 4.6-inch body, and is basically everything you could want in a smaller smartphone. Gallery | 27 Photos Sony Xperia Z3 Compact review + See all 27 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 88 Sony Xperia Z3 Compact Pros Incredible battery life Top-tier performance Flagship design and build quality Reduced in size, but not capability Cons Poor low-light camera performance Sony's Android skin feels antiquated Summary Smartphones that are small in size, but big on performance are a dying breed. With the Xperia Z3 Compact, you get the all the care and attention Sony gave the bigger Z3, just in a more petite package. That includes an elegant design, a (mostly) good camera, strong computing power and spectacular battery life. The Z3 Compact is simply the best small Android smartphone on the market at the moment.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware The Xperia Z line hasn't changed much since Sony revealed the original flagship Z handset nearly two years ago. In fact, the vast majority of Sony devices in recent history have followed the same, strict design language. Thus, the Z3 Compact is essentially a rectangular block with pillowed perimeters, like most of its brethren. In this respect, the Z3C won't be everyone's cup of tea, with its hard, serious lines being a far cry from the sexy curves of HTC's One series, to name just one example. If you're a fan of Sony's blocky styling, however, then the Z3C is certainly a well-executed model of that. The Z3C doesn't have any one, standout design feature, but as always, the devil is in the details. The matching tempered-glass panels covering the front and back, the aluminum power key, the metal detailing around the main camera lens and headphone jack -- all reminders you're handling a premium, albeit understated device. Even the branding strewn across the back is pleasingly arranged, with silver Sony and gray Xperia/NFC logos stacked neatly along its length. A small note of the main camera specs also sits between the relatively large lens and small, circular LED flash. There's slightly less going on up front. A small, silver Sony logo sits just above the 4.6-inch display; oblong stereo speakers live near the top and bottom; and the front-facing camera is tucked away in the upper-right corner, with a multicolor notification LED on the opposite side. The only buttons, physical or otherwise, are located along the right-hand edge; you've got a two-stage camera key, volume rocker and power button, all of which are one kind of metal or another. The latter two aren't in what I'd call a standard layout, both being close to the middle. However, the size of the device actually makes the positioning of the power and volume keys rather convenient: right where your thumb instinctively rests when holding it, assuming you're clutching it with your right hand. Along the top edge, you'll find the headphone jack and secondary mic; the primary mic is on the bottom edge, naturally, alongside a strap hole for attaching charms to the thing, or whatever the kids do to their phones these days. The left border is by far the busiest, with two sealed cavities hiding the micro-USB port/microSD slot and nano-SIM tray, respectively. These flank Sony's magnetic charging dock connector, because every phone the company makes apparently must be compatible with these niche accessories. It's definitely the ugliest feature of the handset; it breaks up the \"flow\" of the pillowed border, but it's not so offensive as to spoil the overall look. As I've hinted at before, not every facet of the Xperia Z3 has made the leap to its smaller counterpart. You can spot they're related from a mile off, but where the Z3 is wrapped in a metal frame, the Z3C is bound in a hard, translucent plastic, with the same nylon corner caps adding extra durability to these higher-risk impact zones. Sony calls the transparent effect \"liquid reflection,\" probably because it's an easier sell than \"see-through plastic.\" Some might not like the fact that the premium, metal rim has been omitted from the Compact, but I actually prefer the plastic's added sense of depth, just because it's a little... different. What the Z3C lacks in metal accents, it more than makes up for in build quality. The thing is solid as a rock, and everything is put together with absolute precision -- it kind of has to be to qualify for its IP65/68 waterproof and dustproof rating (that's higher than you'll ever realistically need unless you plan on freediving while on the phone to mom and dad). The serious-looking black model with dark-gray wrapping I've been using complements the tight build nicely, but you can expect the same robustness from the white, minty-green and copper-orange options too. At a glance, the Z3C might not look like the most comfortable device to hold. For starters, there's a thin, sharp rim around the two glass panels on either side of the curved border, and the corners of the device are only slightly off-square. Furthermore, the back panel offers minimal grip, it being slick glass and all. These initial observations are moot, however, because the phone is small enough, at 127 x 64.9 x 8.6mm (5 x 2.56 x 0.34 inches), that you don't need to apply a ton of pressure to these potential problem areas to keep it safely in-hand. The Z3C is slighter heavier than I expected for a phone of this size, at 129g (4.55 ounces), but its weight has no negative impact on usability. It's as easy to hold and operate one-handed as it is to forget about when stuffed in a jean pocket. This basic facet of the everyday user experience is something smartphone manufacturers seem to be ignoring en masse. It's been refreshing to use a smaller device as my daily driver, not because I have tiny hands, but because I believe an emphasis on portability has been lost somewhere in the race for the biggest display. There's obviously a huge demand for big-screen devices, but with the Z1 Compact and newer Z3 Compact, Sony's continuing to cater to those who want a smaller handset without giving up high-end specs. Personally, I prefer having something that's painless to use and carry around in lieu of \"enhanced content consumption,\" or whatever tagline marketers want to use to promote the newest 6-inch monster.

While the bigger Z3 has stuck with a 1080p panel instead of opting to join the QHD clan, the Z3C has a miserly 1,280 x 720 screen, which translates to a pixel density of 319 ppi. I'm kidding: A 720p display is more than adequate for the Compact's size, and you'd struggle to find any meaningful difference if compared with a 1080p screen of the same dimensions (well, maybe a decline in battery life, but that's about it). The panel at play here is an IPS LCD affair, with Sony's Triluminos and X-Reality technologies that promise richer, more natural colors and enhanced contrast. The Z3C (and its bigger brother) are also said to pack a new \"intuitive contrast-enhancement technology\" that kicks in when the handset detects an external source of bright light, but I didn't notice it having any effect in my investigations. The white balance of the panel is spot on as far as I can tell (you can always tweak the default setting in the display menu if you find otherwise). Colors are bold and bright too. However, blacks aren't quite as deep as they could be, but this is common to LCD technology, and it's something OLED screens are inherently better at producing. Viewing angles are decent, even if you do start to lose color saturation past a certain tilt point. All things considered, the Z3C's display is a high-quality one, but it does falter slightly when it comes to sunlight readability. Don't get me wrong: It kicks out enough power to not be an issue in most cases. Still, the glare from the glass covering it isn't entirely eradicated, so I doubt you'll want to dive into YouTube on a lazy afternoon in the park. In other miscellany, the tempered glass covering the display (and the rear of the device) is notably adept at repelling fingerprint oil and grime. It's not completely immune to smudges, of course, but it never gets to that overloaded, slightly sticky point I've experienced on a few handsets (including Sony's own Xperia SP). It took me a while to figure out the nuances of the auto-brightness setting. While it reacts appropriately to changing conditions, it's always anchored to the manual slider setting, meaning it will only adjust within a range of that preset. From a user-experience point of view, I must admit that moving from a 5.2-inch device to the 4.6-inch Z3C brought about a remarkable decline in my touchscreen typing accuracy. But after getting used to a more condensed keyboard layout, I was more or less back to full speed within a few days. Software The Xperia Z3 Compact is running the latest consumer-ready version of Android (4.4.4 KitKat) beneath Sony's proprietary user interface. Thankfully, it's a fairly light skin that doesn't differ all that much from stock Android, which I prefer to some of the heavier manufacturer customizations (*cough* TouchWiz *cough*). But, that also means there's nothing particularly special about Sony's UI. From my point of view, though, it's intuitive and, well, it just works. Anyone vaguely familiar with Android will be able to dive right in, no tutorial required. That said, there are a few gems baked in here, like the easy-access screen-recording feature we told you about in our recent Xperia Z3 review. Overall though, just like the design of Sony's hardware, its software hasn't evolved much over the years either. Thus, the UI does feel a little dated in comparison to, say, the most recent iterations of HTC's Sense skin. The icons for Sony's own apps are drawn in the same 3D style they have been for some time, and are perhaps a bit too cartoony given the Z3C's all-business design. It's a minor quibble, though, and shouldn't be enough to drive anyone away from what's otherwise a superb little handset. Out of the box, every panel on the Z3C's home screen carousel is absolutely sodden in widgets and shortcuts promoting Sony's apps and services, so you'll have to spend a little time organizing this to your liking. The app drawer is just as noisy, but that's kind of expected when Sony creates so much of its software in house. Some of this is what I consider straight-up bloatware, like the preinstalled Kobo, OfficeSuite, AVG antivirus and Garmin navigation apps. Fortunately, you can uninstall these if you have no use for them, but services like Video Unlimited, the Xperia Lounge Sony-centric news app and Lifelog activity tracker are on there for good. You can always just ignore them if they're of no use to you, however. All of Google's services are present, of course, but Sony has its own versions of several key programs. This means there are duplicate music players, video players and photo album apps. No big deal, but coupled with some of the new camera tricks having their own icons now, too, the app drawer is messy to begin with, let alone when you start loading whatever you want onto the device. Additionally, the entire Z3 range (Z3, Z3 Compact and Z3 Tablet Compact) are the first Sony phones to support PS4 Remote Play, a feature previously found only on the PS Vita handheld console. Unfortunately, the app that enables this isn't available until November. I'm disappointed I haven't had the chance to try it out, but honestly, I can't see myself playing the next Call of Duty title in bed on a 4.6-inch screen too often. Camera Since the Xperia Z1, Sony's used the same 20.7-megapixel, 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS sensor across its flagship Z line. The Z3 and Z3 Compact are similarly equipped, with the addition of a new, wider 25mm, f/2.0 G Lens. The pair also share the same 2.2-megapixel front-facing camera, too, which isn't exactly a selfie addict's dream, but perfectly adequate for the odd video call. Before I get on to how the primary shooter performs, a quick walkthrough of Sony's camera app. From the viewfinder, you can quickly adjust settings like scene selection, flash mode, exposure and white balance. One icon opens up a deeper menu that allows you to change everything from image resolution and ISO setting to smile detection and image storage location. Gallery | 23 Photos Sony Xperia Z3 camera samples + See all 23 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") In addition to all these \"quick\" settings, you can jump into the camera-mode menu straight from the viewfinder. The options in here are similarly endless. There's Sony's \"superior auto\" mode, manual mode (you must use this if you want full 20.7-megapixel images), 4K video-recording mode, panorama, burst shot, background defocus, live-to-YouTube broadcasting, ad infinitum. New additions to this lineup include AR fun and effect modes, which let you pepper images with characters, objects and 3D text; Face in mode that creates a picture-in-picture image using both shooters; and Multi-camera mode, which stitches images from two paired Sony devices together. You can download even more, too, through a special store built into Sony's camera app. I'm sure most of these are useful in the right situation, and it means you can make the most out of the 20.7-megapixels you're given, but I find the app horribly cluttered due to the sheer number of modes and settings. I'm not saying the camera app should have fewer features, but there has to be a simpler, more user-friendly way of keeping them accessible without distracting from the primary camera functions. I mentioned the dedicated, physical shutter key in the hardware section, but it's worth revisiting here. The two compression points (first to focus, second to shoot) are very clearly defined, and I preferred them to the on-screen shutter button (you can also bring up the camera app with a long-press of the physical key). Shutter response is near-instant, by the way, so you have a good chance of catching whatever shot you've scrambled to capture. Now onto the primary camera's performance. Long story short, it takes some stunning pictures with perfect color saturation in well-lit conditions, whether you're in the manual mode taking advantage of every megapixel, or using the superior auto mode, which only takes up to 8-megapixel photos. In particular, some of the close-ups I took have an incredible level of detail, beating out one of Sony's NEX mirrorless digital cameras I happen to have. In favorable lighting conditions, the camera really excels, but it's not completely without fault. The automatic white balance setting is extremely accurate, especially when faced with artificial lighting. Occasionally, though, images came out slightly overexposed, meaning the auto-compensator hadn't judged the scene correctly. HDR mode didn't quite live up to my expectations either: It only adds a little extra \"pop\" to images. Low-light performance is disappointing, and all the photos I took in dark conditions came out horribly noisy, with any light sources in the image appearing blown out. The Z3 and Z3 Compact are the only smartphones that currently support an ISO setting of 12,800 (only available in the superior auto mode), which is said to \"take your smartphone to new levels of low light.\" The bigger the ISO value, the grainier you can expect an image to be, and yet my night shots were seriously noisy at ISO values under half that of the maximum 12,800. In manual mode, you can pick your ISO setting from 50 up to 3,200, but low-balling just results in crisper, pointlessly dark photos. Slow shutter speeds also mean you need to have an unnaturally steady hand to get anything other than a blurry mess. I'm not quite sure how Sony's managed it, but the Z3C's camera is fantastic in ideal conditions, and verging on terrible as soon as your available light fades. In some situations, you can use the LED flash to get a much better shot. It kicks out one hell of a blast, though, so anything too close will simply be an outline of white light. Video performance is a similar story. On a bright day or in well-lit conditions, 1080p video at 30fps (it will also record at 60fps) has a lovely amount of detail. Not as good as stills, but almost. Recording moving subjects doesn't result in many dropped frames either, but the autofocus can be jumpy if you're panning around a lot. The Z3C is capable of recording 4K video too, which is gorgeous if slightly overexposed on the default setting. The audio quality here is also worth praising, but again, video performance falls off in poorly lit conditions -- clips become extremely noisy, and any light source looks like an explosion.\n(Full-resolution camera sample images are available here.) Performance and battery life A flagship name should come with flagship performance, which is something other \"Mini Me\" manufacturers don't take as seriously. Like the bigger Z3, the Compact uses a quad-core 2.5GHz Snapdragon 801, except it has 2GB of RAM instead of 3GB on the Z3. There's 16GB of internal storage -- just under 12GB of that is available to the user out of the box -- and a microSD slot ready to receive cards as large as 128GB. I shouldn't really need to tell you that a quad-core 2.5GHz processor is beyond adequate for everyday use. The phone flies when I'm navigating the home screen and menus, or hopping in and out of apps. Web browsing, too, is a delight, with everything loading as fast as your current connection will allow; no tiling or performance hiccups anywhere. Gaming is a similar story. Throw a graphically intensive racer like Asphalt 8: Airborne at the Z3C, crank the graphics settings up to the max and you won't find anything to complain about. I expected as much from a Snapdragon 801, but it's still worth pointing out the Z3C is an absolute beast. Don't let its size fool you into thinking it's anything but a top-tier performer. The Z3C supports basically every connection protocol there is. The GPS module locks on to your location almost instantly, and maintains a solid connection with accurate positioning; the handset also works with Russia's GLONASS and China's BeiDou GPS technologies. It also has every radio you could imagine -- dual-band 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, NFC, WiFi Direct, Miracast, MirrorLink, DLNA and MHL 3.0. There's also a Cat 4 LTE chip (maximum download speeds of 150 Mbps). Actually, if we're being precise, there are two variants of the device: The D5803 plays nice with LTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 20, while the D5833 supports Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 28 and TD LTE Band 40. That makes the D5833 the best SKU for Asian markets, and the D5803 the one European/North American buyers will want to spring for, but be aware that neither model is compatible with Sprint's LTE network. The music-listening experience is far from an afterthought here, with high-resolution audio support and a \"Digital Sound Enhancement Engine\" that promises to upscale compressed files and improve their quality. Paired with Sony's now-standard ClearAudio+ tech, the Z3C makes for a solid portable music player. Songs have a clear, well-balanced tone when played through headphones, and you get an impressive amount of bass coming through, which is something a lot of smartphones struggle with. You'll never want for more volume than the handset can throw out, and if you purchase Sony's MDR-NC31EM headset, you'll also benefit from the phone's integrated digital noise-canceling tech. The stereo speakers on the front of the Z3C are no joke either. You can crank them up to 11 with minimal distortion, but you won't get quite the same depth of sound as you do through headphones. The Z3 Compact runs on a non-removable 2,600mAh battery, which is a lot of juice for a phone this size, especially since a 720p display isn't as power-hungry as a higher-resolution panel would be. Sony could've slyly figured out cold fusion for all I know, though: The battery life is nothing shy of incredible. The company claims the Z3C has a \"groundbreaking two-day battery,\" but I consider this a modest claim, and only true for power users. If your phone tends to sit on your desk at work for most of the day, with you checking the odd email, taking a few calls and doing a bit of farm maintenance in Hey Day, then you're looking at three to four full days of use without needing to recharge. Considering every phone I've used in the past has, at most, made it through two days with relatively frugal use, I'm shocked at what Sony's managed to achieve here. The Z3C's battery life is simply outstanding, and that's without resorting to any of the several power-saving modes available. In Engadget's standard looping video test at 50 percent screen brightness, the Compact lasted an honorable 11 and a half hours before dying. That's only 45 minutes less than the Z3, which carries a much larger 3,100 mAh battery, and is a nod to what you can expect with everyday use. The competition As I've mentioned, if you're hunting for a smaller smartphone with flagship DNA, your options are extremely limited these days. The new iPhone 6 is obviously a direct competitor to the Z3 Compact, but really, your decision between the two is going to boil down to which platform you prefer: iOS or Android. While the iPhone 6 only has a slightly larger 4.7-inch display, it commands a significantly bigger overall footprint than the Z3C due to it being only 6.9mm thick (compared with the Compact's depth of 8.6mm), and thus needing to spread its internal components around. You also need to consider how important battery life is, as well as what you want out of your smartphone's camera. In the Android space, there are really only three phones that come close to the size of the Z3 Compact. They are the HTC One mini 2, Samsung Galaxy S5 mini and the new Galaxy Alpha. Each has its own merits. The One mini 2 has a beautiful aluminum unibody design, but is bigger than the Z3C in every way despite having a smaller 4.5-inch 720p display. HTC's shrunken flagship also has a quad-core 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 processor and 13-megapixel main camera, as well as a smaller 2,100mAh battery. The Galaxy S5 mini is both taller and thicker than the Z3 Compact, with a 4.5-inch 720p screen, quad-core 1.4GHz processor, 8MP camera and 2,100mAh battery. Some of the Galaxy S5's premium features have carried over to the smaller version, like waterproof certification, heart rate monitor and fingerprint scanner. The HTC One mini 2 is a lovely device, especially if you're not down with Sony's design ethos, but the problem with comparing these with the Z3C is that they simply aren't in the same league as the Compact when it comes to computing power and imaging. Samsung's Galaxy Alpha is a stronger competitor. It's one of Samsung's best-looking handsets to date, and carries the same powerful processor as the Z3 Compact. It has a fingerprint scanner and heart rate sensor like the GS5 mini, as well as a 4.7-inch 720p display, but still isn't as impressive as the Z3 Compact is several areas. It only has a 12-megapixel camera, for example, no expandable storage and a fairly meager 1,860mAh battery. It's also much taller than the Z3 Compact, and thus isn't as neat. Furthermore, it's seriously expensive, at around $720 for an unlocked Galaxy Alpha. No US carriers are currently ranging the Z3 Compact, leaving us raw, unlocked pricing to assess its competitiveness (UK pricing can be found here). Sony's recently started selling the Z3C in the US for $530 online, but Expansys currently has the best deal at $510. Newegg will sell you one for $520, GSM Nation for $529 and Amazon's price point tends to fluctuate within the $520/$530 range. Compared with the Galaxy Alpha, the Z3C is obviously the better option, but the HTC One mini 2 and Galaxy S5 mini do come in cheaper than the Compact. As a brief aside, a contract-free iPhone 6 is $649 from T-Mobile in the US, but again, they run different platforms, which I imagine will be the real deciding factor, not price. On Amazon, a One mini 2 retails for around $455, while the S5 mini (LTE version) goes for $430. Both are cheaper than the Z3 Compact, but I would say the $100 or so more you'd pay for Sony's pint-sized flagship is worth every cent, if only for the extra battery life. If you're not after top-of-the-range specs, though, the HTC One mini 2 is a striking device, even if it is bigger than the Compact. Wrap-up Having spent a decent amount of time with the new Xperia Z3 Compact, I can easily recommend it as the best small Android smartphone. Low-light camera performance aside, it's got everything you want in a flagship handset, except maybe a fingerprint sensor or coffee maker, packed into a neat and portable package. Its rectangular design might not appeal to everyone, but it's an extremely well-built device with a certain understated elegance. You've also got yourself a great camera as long as conditions are favorable, and all the power you could possibly need with a quad-core 2.5GHz CPU at its heart. The Z3C's endless battery life is truly something to behold, and compared with competing handsets of a similar size, it's reasonably priced, to boot. The reality is you don't have much choice if you're after a top-spec device that comes in under five inches, but Sony's shown once again that a smaller flagship doesn't necessarily need to be a lesser flagship. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: mobilepostcross, review, sony, sonyxperiaz3compact, uk-reviews, video, xperiaz3compact, z3compact \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20975529 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20975529\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/sony/xperia/z3/compact/\"> Sony Xperia Z3 Compact </a> Sony Xperia Z3 Compact Buy from $382 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/sony/xperia/z3/compact/\" title=\"Sony Xperia Z3 Compact reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 16 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android Screen size 4.6 inches Internal memory 16 Camera 20.7\u00a0megapixels Dimensions 5 x 2.56 x 0.34 in Weight 4.55 oz Announced 2014-09-03 see all specs \u2192 7.7average user rating Reception and call quality 9 Display 9 Battery life 9.4 Camera 8.6 Ease of use 8.9 Design and form factor 8.3 Portability (size / weight) 9.3 Media support 9 Durability 6.8 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 8.5 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $382.93 + tax & shipping Buy now 112 How often do you upgrade your phone? 4 Moto X (2014) vs. Sony Xperia Z3 compact 0 Production Fault Beware the Z3 Compact!

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2015/04/03/hp-spectre-x360-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "April 3rd 2015 at 2:00 pm", "body": " The Spectre x360 is HP's newest flagship notebook. It's also probably the closest you'll get to seeing Microsoft build its own laptop. You see, though the machine has Hewlett-Packard's name on it, HP designed it in close collaboration with engineers from the Windows team, optimizing everything from the fan noise to the screen's color gamut. The result is a well-built laptop with fast performance, long battery life and a nearly bloatware-free version of Windows. And at $900 to start, it undercuts almost all of its rivals. Is there anything not to like? Gallery | 40 Photos HP Spectre x360 review + See all 40 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 88 HP Spectre x360 Pros Attractive, well-made design Long battery life Colorful screen, good viewing angles Comfortable keyboard Fast performance Reasonably priced Cons A bit heavy for a 13-inch laptop, even one with a convertible design Relative heaviness makes it less practical to use as a tablet\u00a0 Touchpad offers a bit too much friction Summary The Spectre x360 is one of our new favorite laptops, thanks to its premium design, fast performance, vibrant screen and comfortable keyboard. It's relatively heavy compared to competing laptops, but it mostly makes up for it with nearly best-in-class battery life.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware HP and Microsoft may have designed one of my new favorite laptops, but they hardly reinvented the wheel in the process. In fact, I think the pair owes at least a little credit to Lenovo, and maybe Apple, too. Think I'm trolling? Consider the evidence. As its name suggests, the x360 has a 360-degree hinge similar to Lenovo's Yoga series that allows the screen to fold back into tablet mode (and Tent Mode, and Stand Mode -- yep, HP even stole Lenovo's names for its different usage modes). Then there's the design. Like the MacBook Air, the x360 is fashioned out of unibody, CNC-machined aluminum, with a wedge-shaped profile that tapers subtly from back to front. It's not a wholesale copy-job, to be sure, but the machine's resemblance to a Mac is unmistakable. HP and Microsoft owe at least a little credit to Lenovo, and maybe Apple, too. Still, HP managed to improve on what's otherwise a tried-and-true formula. Take the hinge, for instance. Though it feels as smooth and controlled as anything Lenovo ever produced, HP's version uses a different kind of mechanism that \"folds into itself\" (to quote what I was told when I first saw it). This allows the machine to be equally thick regardless of whether the screen is in tablet mode or folded shut, like a regular notebook. Speaking of thickness, the machine measures 15.9mm (or 0.63 inch), with the weight coming in at a relatively heavy 1.44kg, or 3.17 pounds on the Quad HD model. In fact, the x360 is actually 3.26 pounds on the full HD version (one panel is thinner than the other). Either way, it feels noticeably denser than a typical 13-inch Ultrabook, and it's definitely heavier than the super-light Yoga 3 Pro. That's irrelevant if you plan to park it on your desk and use it in Stand or Tent mode to watch movies, and it doesn't even really matter when you use the thing as a regular notebook -- it's still easy to tote around in your backpack or shoulder bag. What you might find, though, is that a relatively large, 13-inch PC like this, particularly one this heavy, isn't well-suited for tablet mode. If you do choose to use it that way, I suggest resting it on your lap; holding up a three-plus-pound device gets tiresome after exactly five seconds. On the plus side, at least, a slightly bulkier machine means fewer compromises when it comes to ports. On board, we have three USB 3.0 connections, along with a full-sized HDMI socket, a Mini DisplayPort, an SD card slot, a headphone jack and a volume rocker, for use in tablet mode. That's no small thing at a time when some laptop makers are trying to get away with including just one port. Finally, HP sells Ethernet and HDMI-to-VGA adapters for $30 apiece. (In my first look, I initially said they came in the box, but that's not true; HP just included them gratis for us reviewers.) In addition to that lie-flat hinge, the keyboard and trackpad are also entirely HP's -- and in some ways they're better than the competition, too. The metal buttons have a similar spacious, island-style layout as many rival machines, except the keys have a full 1.5mm of travel, making them much cushier than what I'm used to on Ultrabooks. (Perhaps this is one benefit to having a slightly thicker machine: less of a reason to settle for a flat, lifeless keyboard.) In addition, I appreciate how relatively quiet the buttons are, even despite their springiness. Also, most of the keys are large enough that I can find them by feel, without having to worry about hitting the wrong one. Even the arrow keys -- some of the few shrunken buttons here -- were easy to get to when I wanted to highlight text. What's funny is that although HP teamed up with Microsoft on this, it didn't use one of Microsoft's own \"Precision\" touchpads; instead, it went with a clickpad from Synaptics. Make that an extra-wide clickpad -- the trackpad here has much the same elongated shape as on the Spectre 13, HP's last-generation flagship. When that model first came out, the idea was that people could use so-called touch zones on either end of the trackpad to more easily pull off certain gestures specific to Windows 8 -- you know, like swiping in from the right to expose the Charms Bar. As it happens, the Charms Bar is about to go away in Windows 10 (set to launch in a few months) and so, there are no touch zones here, per se; just one really wide touchpad. HP figured, even if you don't need those zones anymore, you might still enjoy having the extra horizontal space. I have to say I do. In general, the touchpad is reliable; the cursor almost always goes where I intended, and multitouch gestures like two-finger scrolls work well, too. I would prefer a slightly lower-friction touch surface, but if a little more drag means more accurate tracking, then that's fine. Better that than a smooth touchpad that doesn't actually do what I want it to. The x360 comes standard with a 1080p, optically bonded touchscreen, but is also offered with a 2,560 x 1,440 panel for an extra hundred bucks. Unfortunately, I've only had the chance to test the full HD edition, so I can't tell you firsthand just how pixel-dense the Quad HD option is. But I think I can guess, and I bet you can too. If you think the 13-inch MacBook Pro's 2,560 x 1,600 display is gorgeous, you will probably appreciate this as well. As it is, I didn't find myself pining for the sharper panel, especially considering how great the battery life is when you settle for the lower resolution. Thanks to a 72 percent color gamut, the tones here are nice and rich, though not overly saturated. Also, though the viewing angles on this IPS screen aren't perfect, they're wide enough that I could still watch movies and get work done with the screen dipped forward, within a certain range of flexibility. As for audio, the dual speakers on the laptop's bottom side exhibit some of the tinniness I've come to expect from notebooks, but it's no worse than what I've observed on other machines.

Unsurprisingly, then, I observed mostly the same fast performance, including speedy seven-second boot-ups and resume times of less than a second. The benchmarks back this up too, with scores that largely match the XPS 13 (though the jury seems to be out on which is the graphics champ). Wireless performance is another area where HP and Microsoft put their heads together. The machine makes use of a 2x2 802.11ac WiFi radio, though the two companies claim it has stronger range than even similarly configured systems, with wireless throughput not dropping off as quickly in either the 2.4GHz or 5GHz bands. I'm not equipped to test that in any sort of scientific way, but I can say that wireless streaming was fast and reliable, and that the machine was also quick to reconnect after coming out of sleep. If there's one area where the x360 trails its peers, it's disk speeds. Though it does indeed come standard with an SSD (a Samsung-made one, in my case), these are of the slower mSATA variety -- not PCIe-based disks like we're used to seeing on other flagship laptops. That means while its peak read speeds of 555 MB/s are quite healthy, its max writes of 270 MB/s are relatively low. On some rival machines, you might see writes in the 500-and-something-megabytes-per-second range, and then there are outliers like the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, which delivered 1.3 GB/s reads and 643.6 MB/s write speeds. Again, none of that seems to have a negative effect on things like boot and app-load times, but depending on what you're doing and how hard you push the system, you may wish you had some faster transfer speeds. Battery life HP Spectre x360 11:34 MacBook Air (13-inch, 2013) 12:51 Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2015) 11:23 Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, late 2013) 11:18 Chromebook Pixel (2015) 10:01 Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus 8:44 Dell XPS 13 (2015) 7:36 Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro 7:36 Acer Aspire S7-392 7:33 Microsoft Surface Pro 3 7:08 HP rates the x360 for up to 12.5 hours of runtime, depending on the configuration (meaning: The lower-res model lasts longest). Part of that's thanks to a large, 56Wh battery, but HP and Microsoft also pored over the system settings, looking for places where they could make the machine just a little more power efficient. Together, they decided to shut down certain parts of the system when not in use, including the sensors in the hinge that tell the x360 what mode it's in. They also aimed for low fan noise, in part to conserve juice (and I think they succeeded there). Meanwhile, the Quad HD panel uses PSR (Panel Self Refresh) technology, which avoids changing pixels unnecessarily to reduce power consumption. After speaking with an HP spokesperson, it's clear that the QHD model still doesn't get quite the same battery life as the 1080p edition, but perhaps details like that at least help close the gap. Again, I didn't test the higher-res version, so I can't say firsthand. All of this is to say, the battery life really is as long as promised. On the unit I tested, which had a 1080p screen, I very nearly made it to the half-day mark -- 11 hours and 34 minutes of video playback, to be precise. In fact, were it not for my aggressive test settings (WiFi on with brightness fixed at 65 percent), the machine would have lasted even longer. Either way, 11.5 hours is an excellent showing for a laptop this size. The only one we've tested that does better is the MacBook Air. Otherwise, the Spectre x360 manages to slightly edge out the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is in a similar weight class. HP's flagship also far surpasses plenty of lighter-weight Ultrabooks -- machines like the Yoga 3 Pro, Acer Aspire S7, the Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus and Dell's new XPS 13. The Spectre x360 might be heavier than all those systems, but it at least justifies its extra heft with longer runtime. Software Given that Microsoft helped design the x360, it's fair to assume it also runs a relatively clean version of Windows. The operative word being \"relatively.\" My test machine came with Netflix and The Weather Channel, as well as Hearts Deluxe and a few of HP's own apps, like Connected Photo. It also includes a free one-year subscription to McAfee's LiveSafe service. That security coverage is actually pretty useful, though McAfee's desktop pop-ups can be quite annoying (seriously, does it ever learn?). In any case, that little bit of bloatware disqualifies it from being one of Microsoft's Signature Series machine, but it's a clean build nonetheless -- definitely the cleanest I've seen from HP. Additionally, it should go without saying, but the Spectre x360 ships with Windows 8.1, and, like other Windows 8.1 machines, will be eligible for a free upgrade to Windows 10 when it comes out later this year. What's unique in this case is that because HP worked so closely with Microsoft, the x360 is perhaps better optimized for Windows than some of its competitors. For now, most of that optimization has centered on Windows 8.1, but representatives from both camps have indicated to me that after the x360 went on sale, they'd be shifting their engineering resources to focus more on Win 10. Configuration options The Spectre x360 is currently offered in three configurations, priced at $900, $1,150 and $1,400. Starting with the entry-level model, you get the same Core i5-5200U processor I tested here, along with 4GB of RAM and a 1080p touchscreen. Of the three, this is the only one that's customizable, with options to double the RAM ($50), add a Quad HD screen ($100) or upgrade to a dual-core i7 processor ($150). You can also swap out the standard 128GB SSD for a 256GB one ($50) or a 512GB disk ($200). Moving on, the $1,150 model keeps the 1,920 x 1,080 display, but steps up to a Core i7 CPU, 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage. Finally, there's the top-of-the-line $1,400 model, which has a higher-res 2,560 x 1,440 screen and a 512GB SSD (in addition to a Core i7 CPU and 8GB of RAM). That's currently sold out on HP's site, but a company spokesperson says it should be back in stock within the coming weeks. Either way, if you were doing the math earlier, you saw that configuring the base $900 model with tricked-out specs comes to the same price of $1,400, so really, it's not actually \"out of stock\"; you just have to check off more boxes to get it. The competition I've read other tech writers refer to the HP Spectre x360 as a \"MacBook Air competitor.\" That's fair, but also a little lazy: It's a MacBook Air competitor to the extent that every Windows Ultrabook is. The point is, if it's a thin-and-light, high-end laptop you're looking for, you've got lots of options. Too many options, almost. For the sake of not overwhelming you, let's just focus on the best. Perhaps the most direct comparison would be to the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro ($1,249-plus), which also has a 360-degree hinge and flagship specs. At just 2.6 pounds and half an inch thick, it is insanely thin and light, especially for a laptop with a touchscreen and a convertible design. That said, that thinness and lightness come with a couple trade-offs. For one, that compact design is only possible thanks to one of Intel's lower-power Core M processors, which, while perfectly adequate for basic tasks, is not as robust as a fifth-gen Core CPU. Two, there isn't much room for a big battery inside that slim chassis. Indeed, the battery life falls four hours short of what you'll get on the Spectre x360, though it admittedly isn't much better than other skinny Ultrabooks. If you can live without a convertible design, your options become even more plentiful. Our new favorite is the Dell XPS 13 ($800-plus), which crams a 13-inch display into the body of an 11-inch machine, making it way more compact than other machines with the same screen size. At 2.6 pounds, it too is very light for a touchscreen system, and we're fans of its comfy keyboard, fast performance, vibrant screen and surprisingly good audio. My main gripes are that the battery life is merely average, at least if you configure it with a touchscreen, and that if you do want a touch panel, it costs an extra $500. That's because the only touchscreen option has 3,200 x 1,800 resolution; you can't get it with a full HD touch panel, like with the Spectre x360. A shame, that. Other solid options include the Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus ($1,299 and up) and the skinny Acer Aspire S7-393 ($1,300), both of which have been updated with Intel's new fifth-gen Core processors. Lastly, yes, there's the 13-inch MacBook Air, which starts at $999. This, too, was recently refreshed with Intel's Broadwell CPUs, with the battery life still rated for up to 12 hours. As ever, we enjoy the aluminum design (though it's slightly heavier than the competition, at 2.96 pounds), as well as the keyboard and best-in-class trackpad. The biggest trade-off you'll make here is the screen quality: It's the only laptop in the Mac lineup that doesn't have a Retina display; just 1,440 x 900 on the 13-inch model. Wrap-up I asked at the beginning of this review if there's anything not to like about the Spectre x360. Indeed there is: the machine's relative heaviness. At three-plus pounds, it's hardly a clunker, but it is noticeably weightier than other 13-inch machines. Curiously, though, that weight also makes possible so many of the things I like about the laptop. Because the x360 is slightly bulkier than its rivals, it can accommodate a cushier keyboard and a bigger battery, allowing for nearly best-in-class runtime. It also makes room for a ton of ports. If you're shopping in this size class, I'd also suggest you consider a few other models, like the lighter-weight Dell XPS 13, but even then, the specs HP offers for the money are hard to beat. Particularly if you prefer something with a more convertible design, the x360 is a strong -- and reasonably priced -- choice. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: hp, hpspectre, hpspectrex360, microsoft, review, spectre, spectrex360, uk-reviews, x360 \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21159397 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21159397\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/hp/spectre/x360/\"> HP Spectre x360 </a> HP Spectre x360 Core i5 Core i7 Quad HD Buy from $1149 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/hp/spectre/x360/\" title=\"HP Spectre x360 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Type Ultraportable Screen size 13.3 inches Screen resolution 1920 x 1080 Bundled OS Windows (8) System RAM 4 GB Maximum battery life Up to 12.5 hours Weight 3.26 lb Announced 2015-03-01 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Speed and features 10 Design and form factor 10 Battery life 8 Display 8 Durability 10 Expandability 10 Noise 10 Portability (size / weight) 6 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 Displaying prices for model: Core i7-Silver $1149.99 + tax & shipping Buy now $1431.00 + tax & shipping Buy now No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

The Google TV platform it launched four years ago never really took off and the curiously shaped Nexus Q was so beleaguered by its limited functions and high price that it didn't stand a chance. Last year, however, Google finally managed to get a taste of success with the Chromecast, an inexpensive video-streaming dongle that was so simple it eschewed the need for a remote control or dedicated UI. Almost too simple, some would say -- you still need another device lying around to cast content to it and the lack of a UI means it's not quite as user-friendly as a Roku or an Apple TV. Gallery | 23 Photos Nexus Player review + See all 23 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 79 Google Nexus Player Pros Voice search is simple and intuitive Simple card-based interface Google Cast gives it Chromecast-like features Cons Limited storage Search results are limited to Google-related content sources Buggy software Chintzy remote No Ethernet port Summary The Nexus Player is a great, if imperfect, introductory showcase for Android TV. It doesn't have an Ethernet port and suffers from a few bugs, but Android TV's simple interface, intelligent voice search and Google Cast abilities more than make up for it. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") So, Google is taking yet another stab at home entertainment with Android TV, a version of the Android OS rejiggered for the living room. Fittingly, the first Android TV device out of the gate is Google's own Nexus Player, a set-top box made in partnership with ASUS. Unlike the Chromecast, the Nexus Player (and the Android TV ecosystem in general) is squarely going up against the likes of Roku and is also positioned to take on the Amazon Fire TV with its Android-based gaming chops. But can it? Hardware The ASUS-made Nexus Player could essentially be described as a large hockey puck. It's a flat, disc-shaped device with the Nexus logo proudly inscribed on top. Yet, unlike the spherical Nexus Q, the Player is quite inconspicuous. Sure, its slightly unusual circular design might stand out amidst your home theater setup, but its small footprint and compact form factor -- it's barely the size of my hand -- means you probably won't notice it most of the time. Indeed, the only indication that it's powered on is a small LED positioned underneath the unit. That, combined with the fact that the remote works over Bluetooth and not IR, means you could tuck it out of sight and never have to deal with it once it's hooked up. Speaking of which, setup is pretty easy. Simply plug the player into a power outlet, connect it to your TV with an HDMI cable (which is sadly not included) and you're done. There's also a micro-USB port located on the rear, which Google tells us is for developers to use to create and debug apps. If you decide to get a gamepad (which I'll get to shortly), there's also a button underneath the Player that you can press to initiate the Bluetooth pairing process with the accessory. From there, setup is as easy as going through the on-screen instructions: You'll pair your remote, choose your WiFi network and sign in with your Google account. And no, there's no Ethernet port: The Nexus Player is WiFi-only by default. That might not be a big deal for some, but I would've really liked the option; streaming videos over wired connections is typically faster and more reliable than wireless. You could get a micro-USB-to-Ethernet adapter, but that's an additional cost you would have to factor in. On the inside, there's a 1.8GHz quad-core Intel Atom processor plus an Imagination PowerVR Series 6 Graphics 2D/3D Engine, which makes it more powerful than most, if not all, other streaming devices on the market. Navigating through the menus certainly feels zippy enough, and I experienced no noticeable lag when launching apps or playing games. It has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage, though the actual capacity might be less. That isn't a whole lot of space, which means you'll need to be careful not to load too many games on here. The Nexus Player has a dead-simple remote control that's slim, lightweight and home to just a few buttons. It's curved on the sides, so it nestles comfortably in your palm. And, just like the Fire TV's remote, it has a slight groove on the underside for your finger as well. Since the Fire TV is also based on Android OS, it's no surprise that the button layout is similar. There's a voice search button right at the top and a large, circular directional pad underneath. But the similarities end there. Instead of going with the traditional Android navigation controls, the only other keys are a Back button, a Home button (it's the one with the circle on it) and one for play/pause. The remote's overall build quality is a little chintzy, but the buttons have great travel and a nice \"clicky\" feel when pressed. If you'd prefer to use your Android phone as a remote instead, no problem: There's also a handy Android TV Remote Control app in the Play store. I installed it on a Samsung Galaxy S5 and was able to navigate through the menus just like I did with the physical remote. Gamepad The Nexus Player is more than just a streaming box; you can also use it to play games. And while you can certainly play some of them with the regular ol' TV remote, it's much easier to execute killer combo kicks or maneuver hairpin turns on a racetrack with an actual game controller. So, if you so choose, you can purchase the optional Gamepad for the Nexus Player for $40. The ASUS gamepad looks a lot like the Xbox 360's controller, but with a joystick arrangement that's more similar to the PlayStation's. In other words, the d-Pad is on the left; the two analog joysticks are in the middle toward you; and the four face buttons are on the right. Positioned in the center are the back, power and home buttons, while the triggers and shoulder buttons are located on the rear. The buttons aren't nearly as polished as the ones for the Xbox; the aforementioned triggers are on the squishy side, while the d-pad just feels clunky and cheap. Still, it gets the job done most of the time. Software As we saw a few months ago at Google I/O, Android TV has a fairly simple card-based user interface. You'll see a list of recommended titles and recently played shows at the top, and beneath that are your installed apps. YouTube and Songza come preloaded, as well as all the Google Play apps like Movies & TV, the Play store, Music and Games. Underneath that is a list of installed games, and right at the bottom is access to the usual network and display settings. Most apps look the same, with the navigation menu situated on the left and the various options on the right. Gallery | 22 Photos Android TV interface on the Nexus Player + See all 22 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Right at the top of the home screen, however, you'll see a search prompt along with the current time. You could go ahead and click on that button to start a search, but it's far easier to just click on the microphone button on your remote and speak into it -- a small LED on the remote will blink to indicate it's listening. The voice interface works very much like Google Now in that you can ask pretty much any question and it'll try to respond as best as it can. And so I did. One of my questions was, \"Who is Neil Gaiman?\" and it brought up a brief biography (which it'll actually read to you) along with relevant links on YouTube, related movies such as Stardust and Coraline and a list of people who are connected to him. When I asked, \"Who is Doctor Who?\" it pulled up a brief description of the show, a list of current and previous cast members, YouTube links and, of course, a link to the Movies & TV app where you could choose to rent or buy episodes. I also queried \"Oscar-nominated movies 2011\" and it returned with a list of the films that were up for an Academy Award that year. Bear in mind, however, that all of the movies and TV show links that the search feature brings back will undoubtedly lead to Google's own Movies & TV offerings. In other words, you won't find links to Netflix or Hulu or other content sources even if you have those apps installed. That's not entirely surprising given that this is Google's TV platform, but be sure to check that a show or movie is available on those other services before you plunk down your Google Wallet cash for the evening's entertainment. The voice recognition is accurate for the most part, but I did encounter a few occasions when it wouldn't understand me, interpreting \"acted in\" as \"accident\" for example, even after I enunciated the words slowly and carefully. Additionally, sometimes I would ask a question and the light would continue to blink, as if it were waiting for me to finish my query. I had to then press the center circle pad to confirm that I was done. It's clear the voice-input feature, while good, still has room for improvement. Android TV is relatively young, so there aren't too many third-party apps for it just yet. But it does come with the two mainstays -- Netflix and Hulu Plus -- which should satisfy most people. Other entertainment apps include Food Network, PBS Kids, Bloomberg TV, UVideos, TED TV, Crackle, Plex, Red Bull TV, HuffPost Live, DramaFever, AOL On, Dailymotion, Pluto and Madefire Motion Books & Comics. There's also a variety of music apps beyond Google's own to choose from: Vevo, iHeartRadio, Pandora, MusiXmatch and TuneIn. If you're thinking, \"But where's Rdio? Spotify? How about HBO Go?\" then you might be initially disappointed by their absence here. But there's no need to fret, as Android TV also wisely supports Google Cast, which means that any app that can be streamed to the Chromecast can also be streamed to an Android TV device. This means you can continue to use Rdio, Spotify, HBO Go and countless other Chromecast-compatible apps with the Nexus Player. I managed to watch the latest episode of Game of Thrones by selecting the \"Nexus Player\" dropdown in the HBO Go iPad app, and it works just like it does with the Chromecast. As for games, there appears to be quite a number of them available at launch -- I counted around 50, most of which are compatible with the optional Gamepad. I downloaded a few games to test the controller out -- Final Fantasy III, Riptide GP2, Rabbids Big Bang and good ol' Pac-Man. Some of them certainly felt as if they were tablet games shoehorned into a console experience (e.g., commands like \"Touch to start\"), but it wasn't as bad as I thought. Racing the hydro jets in Riptide GP2, for example, felt just as quick and responsive as most console racing games, with good graphics and no noticeable lag. Yet, I did encounter a few problems where an app would crash or I would lose connection with the controllers. I would just be tinkering with a game's display settings, for example, and it would stall. Once when I was playing Rabbids, I lost Bluetooth connectivity with my Gamepad controller entirely. I'm not sure whether to blame the hardware or the software here, but suffice to say that the fit and finish of Android TV is not quite done. The competition The Nexus Player's most direct competitor is Amazon's Fire TV, which also costs $99. It offers a nearly identical feature set, except that Amazon promotes its own content, while the Player is all about pushing Google Play. Amazon's Fire TV seems to have a more robust game library from the outset, and it does have Ethernet while the Player doesn't. However, the Player has a huge ace up its sleeve with Google Cast and a long list of Chromecast-compatible apps, which seems to be growing all the time. When you throw in the wider Android ecosystem into the mix and the potential for lots more apps and games over time, it tips the scales in favor of the Nexus Player. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Roku 3 and the Apple TV, the two other set-top juggernauts on the market. The $100 Roku 3 is perhaps the most formidable in terms of pure content selection -- it supports video content from both Google Play and Amazon along with a whole host of providers that make the lack of Chromecast compatibility acceptable. It also has an Ethernet port, which the Nexus Player lacks, and the remote control has a headset jack. Yet, it doesn't offer quite the same gaming experience and it doesn't have that neat voice search feature that both the Fire TV and the Nexus Player have. The Apple TV, which also costs $99, is on another planet altogether, with an ecosystem all its own. If you're an iTunes addict, you would do wise to stick to the Apple TV no matter what. Additionally, if you have an iPhone or an iPad, you can stream content to it over AirPlay, which is essentially its answer to the Chromecast. But if you like the option of a game library or a video source from Google or Amazon, Apple TV is certainly not for you. Last, but certainly not least is Google's own Chromecast. The $35 dongle does offer huge bang for the buck; the ability to cram in so many streaming services in a tiny, affordable package is very attractive. But, as I mentioned up top, it can be considered almost too simple -- there's no real UI and you do need an external device to stream to it. In a way, the Nexus Player is like the Chromecast on steroids -- it combines all of its functionality with a real set-top interface, gaming features, access to Google's own Play store and more. Is that worth the extra $64? I certainly think so. Wrap-up The Nexus Player is a fantastic, if flawed, introduction to Android TV. Yes, it has a few bugs and it doesn't quite have the app library that its competitors have. The gaming experience also seems completely secondary, as none of the currently available titles are that compelling and most don't appear to be configured with the television in mind. Also, Android TV might not sit well with you if you're not a big consumer of content from Google's Movies & TV library. But if you are, or if you're at least open to the idea, then the Nexus Player is a very compelling proposition. As I mentioned above, Android TV essentially makes the Nexus Player a grown-up Chromecast. You can stream content to it just like you would with the $35 dongle thanks to Google Cast, but you also get an actual, well-designed user interface, a real remote control, a pretty good voice search interface and the entire Android ecosystem for not that much more. While I hesitate to recommend the Nexus Player due to some chintzy hardware and the lack of Ethernet, Android TV is a platform worth keeping an eye on.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/12/19/msi-gt72-dominator-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "December 19th 2014 at 2:00 pm", "body": " The last time I saw MSI's Dominator laptop, I was sick of it. There wasn't anything wrong with it, but at the time, the product name belonged to the GT70: a powerhouse gaming machine that hasn't evolved much since its introduction in 2012. Back then, I loved the machine's heavy chassis, superb keyboard and excellent sound -- but over time, the machine's aesthetic trappings began to bore me. Someone at MSI must have felt the same way: Earlier this year, the company released the GT72, a new Dominator with a whole new design. Soon after, it relaunched the machine with NVIDIA's latest graphics architecture. OK, MSI, let's see if you can make me fall in love again. Gallery | 21 Photos MSI GT72 Review + See all 21 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 85 MSI GT72 Dominator Pros New, improved design Screaming game performance Great speakers, keyboard and display Decent battery life (with GPU switching) Cons Annoying trial software pack-ins Trackpad has no tactile boundaries Summary The GT72 take everything that was great about its predecessor and wraps it into a new, more attractive package. The result is a well-built, ridiculously powerful gaming rig that lives up to the \"Dominator\" name.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Look and feel On a conceptual level, the new Dominator isn't all that different from its predecessors: It still features a large 17-inch display and a wide, heavy chassis, plus enough power to make the average gaming laptop blush. Still, its design feels less dated. It's a study in matte black aluminum with few visual flourishes. The front edge (and the top of the screen lid) comes to a wide-pointed peak with red accents and a subtle crimson paint peers out from behind the speaker grille. LED lighting behind the keyboard adds a little optional color, but overall the Dominator doesn't overdo it in the aesthetics department, and that's a good thing. The GT72 still fits the overbearing profile of a 17-inch gaming laptop, but it is a little smaller than the previous Dominator. The new design's 16.85 x 11.57 x 1.89-inch frame is noticeably thinner than the GT70's 2.17-inch chassis. It still weighs a solid 8.33 pounds, but at least it makes good use of its size: Four USB 3.0 ports run down the left side of its frame, accompanied by a quartet of audio jacks and an SD card reader. Two more USB connections and an optical drive live on the right edge of the machine, followed by all the other usual suspects on the rear: a power adapter, Ethernet jack, HDMI output and two DisplayPort plugs, just in case you want to rock a three-monitor setup. MSI's original Dominator featured a parade of physical media keys that lived just north of the keyboard. This switchboard went through a handful of overhauls as the years went on, crowding the edge of the chassis with WiFi toggles, disc-eject buttons, brightness controls and other unnecessary redundancies. The GT72's control deck is simpler. Five buttons run down the left edge of the machine's keyboard, and they're all useful. There's a power key, of course, but also a button that switches between discrete and integrated graphics (this requires a reboot); a \"cooler boost\" fan overdrive mode; a shortcut that launches the Dominator's game-streaming software; and a keyboard backlight toggle. Keyboard and trackpad Speaking of the keyboard, I'm happy to report that MSI is still using SteelSeries to power its backlit keys. It's a physically satisfying keyboard, with simple, island-style key caps that fall with a short, but soft depression. Even so, most of its magic happens behind the scenes. The included SteelSeries Engine software suite allows the user to create custom macros, and then program those macros to any button on the keyboard's surface, effectively making it a 100 percent reprogrammable typewriter. You can also customize the backlight with countless color combinations and even create statistical reports that highlight which keys are used most frequently during a timed play session. Useful features if you want them, but invisible if you don't. I can't ask for much more. Technically speaking, there isn't anything wrong with the GT72's touchpad. Its large, smooth surface accurately reads my finger's movements and translates them into the exact on-screen action I intended to execute. Its physical buttons depress with a satisfying, tactile response. The pad's boundaries are defined by a thin LED glow that nicely matches the backlight of the machine's keyboard -- but still, I don't like it. It's an issue of form versus function. While technically functional, visually appealing and objectively fine, the Dominator's pad is impossible to locate by feel alone. It's not just flush with the palm rest; its surface is the surface of the palm rest. I accidentally dragged my finger off of the touch surface on multiple occasions while using the Dominator, and it was frustrating every single time. Display and audio Large, gorgeous displays are the saving grace of most oversized gaming laptops, and the Dominator has never been an exception to that rule. The GT72's screen is a strong LCD with few caveats. Sharp visuals and vibrant colors are the standard here. Games look great; Blu-ray discs are a joy to watch; and there's very little to complain about. If I were to nitpick, I'd say that it loses contrast if you view it from harsh, impractically low angles, but that's true of most displays. The Dominator series has a history of offering great audio, and that tradition lives on with the GT72. Like its predecessors, this machine boasts Dynaudio speakers and, as always, they sound great. Loud, clear sound pumps from the laptop's speaker bar. It's among the best audio you can get on a laptop without plugging in a pair of headphones. The machine's sound is augmented by Sound Blaster Cinema software as well, with distinct modes for gaming, music, cinema and voice. That said, you won't need to touch it: The GT72's equalizer pretty much manages itself.

Is it ridiculously powerful, too? Of course it is. The spec list for my $2,400 review unit is practically a cheat sheet for building an overwhelmingly powerful mobile gaming rig: a 2.5GHz (3.5GHz with Turbo Boost) Intel Core i7-4710HQ CPU, 16GB of DDR3L RAM, a 128GB boot drive, a second 1TB drive for game installs and NVIDIA's latest GPU -- an 8GB GeForce GTX 980M. It's not even MSI's most tricked-out configuration, but it's close -- and has more than enough power to shrug off anything my game library could throw at it. Fancy yourself a round of Battlefield 4? You'll be clocking over 100 frames per second on ultra high visual settings if you turn V-Sync off. More of a Call of Duty fan? No problem: Advanced Warfare runs at a steady 81 fps on \"extra\" detail with 2x supersampling enabled. Not everything I played pushed triple digits, but I couldn't find a single game that didn't run at a respectable clip. Maxing out the visuals in Titanfall will run the game at 44 fps, but you can easily kick that above 60 fps by tweaking the anti-aliasing settings. The Witcher 2, meanwhile, racked up 38 fps on ultra with Ubersampling enabled (and 90 fps without). The only game that stuttered was Ryse, which actually ran at 57 fps on its maximum default settings, but sometimes fell into the low 20s with supersampling turned on. This kind of performance usually turns laptops into PC gaming hotplates, but the GT72 actually stays fairly cool under pressure. It took almost 20 minutes of fast-paced multiplayer action before I felt the heat of the Dominator's frame on my lap, and it never reached the point where I was uncomfortable. Turning the machine's \"cooler boost\" function on will kick its internal fans into overdrive and drive the temperature down a bit further, too. I never reached a point where I needed to use this feature, but I often did anyway: A cool laptop is a happy laptop. Battery life MSI GT72 Dominator 3:09 (discrete GPU) 4:38 (integrated GPU) Razer Blade 14-inch 6:24 MSI GT70 Dragon Edition 4:34 Razer Blade (2014) 4:27 Razer Edge Pro 3:40 ASUS ROG G751 3:40 Razer Blade 2.0 3:29 MSI GT70 Dominator (2014) 3:21 MSI GS60 Ghost 3:13 Alienware 14 3:07 Alienware 17 2:55 At first blush, the GT72 Dominator Pro seems to have short run time: Our standard video-looping test drained the battery in just three hours. That's a mediocre showing for a high-end gaming laptop with a beefy GPU -- and not nearly enough to justify using the rig more than six feet away from a wall outlet. Fortunately, better battery life is just a reboot away: Pressing the Dominator's dedicated GPU-switch button (on the left) puts an integrated Intel HD Graphics 4600 in charge of visuals. It won't be able to play games until you switch back to the discrete NVIDIA GPU, but now the machine can run for over four and a half hours unplugged. Perfect for web browsing and general computing tasks. Software There's nothing better than booting up a new laptop to a blank, unmolested installation of Windows. It's satisfying -- no bloatware, no trial software to uninstall and no garbage apps -- but it's not an experience you'll get with the GT72 Dominator. The machine certainly isn't the worst offender in terms of pack-in software, but an advertisement to activate (read: purchase) Norton Security will never be the first thing I want to see when I start a new machine for the first time (and no, Norton, I don't really want to get my \"Norton Toolbar\" back either). Most of the software here isn't too bad. NVIDIA's GeForce Experience is naturally installed as part of the GPU's software suite and there are applications for controlling the keyboard backlight, macro keys and an MSI-sourced app to track system performance, temperature and hotkeys. There's also a six-month trial of XSplit Gamecaster. Normally, a game-streaming trial wouldn't bother me, but the GT72 has a hardware button dedicated to that trial software. If you don't buy it, that button loses its utility. That's awful. Configuration options and the competition The $2,400 GT72 2QE I'm reviewing here (Intel Core i7-4710HQ, NVIDIA GTX 980M graphics and 16GB of RAM) isn't the most expensive Dominator MSI offers, but it's not that different from the product's higher-end configurations either. Adding $250 will score you an additional 8GB of RAM and a pair of 128GB SSDs arranged in a RAID 0 configuration (that's 256GB of combined space). Another $350 (for a total price of $3,000) will double that SSD boot disc again and bring you to 32GB of RAM. If you're looking for a little more power or a slightly smaller price tag, you've got options there too: MSI sells a $3,400 variant with a 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-4980HQ CPU, and will upgrade the SSD storage to a full terabyte for an additional $500. Alternatively, you could pay as little as $2,000 for a Dominator more closely matching our review unit, but you'll have to settle for a downgraded 6GB NVIDIA GTX 970M GPU and only 12GB of RAM. Still not what you want? Search around: Sites like iBuyPower can tweak and customize the rig beyond MSI's stock configurations. As always, there are plenty of alternative PC gaming powerhouses available if you know where to look. Folks into MSI, but not sold on the GT72's new chassis may want to look at the GS60 Ghost -- it can be built to match the GT72's lower-end configuration in both price and specifications, but is somehow less than an inch thick. Last year's Dominator might be a compelling option too: The GT70's design may be outdated and its internals may represent the best of last year, but it'll still run almost anything you throw at it (and cost hundreds less, to boot). Looking for NVIDIA's latest GPU from a different manufacture? It can be done, but you'll have to walk off the beaten path. GTX GeForce 970M and 980M equipped-laptops can be had from Maingear, AVADirect, Gigabyte and Digital Storm in dozens of configurations -- from the modestly priced $1,600 Clevo P150SM-A to Digital Storm's $4,021 Behemoth. If you're willing to put in some leg work, there are plenty of options. If you want my advice, though, take a look at the ASUS ROG G751: it's a close match to the GT72 in both price and specifications (an Intel Core i7-4710HQ CPU, 32GB of DDR3 RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M graphics with 4GB GDDR5 and a $2,499 price tag), and features a unique, classy design. Wrap-up Objectively, there was never anything wrong with the original GT70 Dominator. Sure, I grew tired of its design, but it still featured top-notch internals, excellent speakers, a solid keyboard and a great screen. The GT72 took all of those elements and wrapped them in a new skin. Now, MSI has a new Dominator -- one with better heat distribution, a (slightly) thinner profile, notably better battery life and, of course, a fresh, modern design. It's a lot of little things, and it's enough. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: Dominator, gaming laptop, gaming laptops, gaminglaptop, gaminglaptops, GT72, GT72 Dominator, gt72dominator, MSI, MSI GT72, MSI GT72 Dominator, MSIGT72, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21118200 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21118200\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/msi/gt72/dominator/\"> MSI GT72 Dominator </a> MSI GT72 Dominator Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/msi/gt72/dominator/\" title=\"MSI GT72 Dominator reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Type Gaming Screen size 17 inches Screen resolution 1920 x 1080 Bundled OS Windows Pointing device Trackpad Video outputs DisplayPort (Mini connector), HDMI Announced 2014-07-10 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Speed and features 10 Design and form factor 6 Battery life 8 Display 10 Durability 8 Expandability 10 Noise 8 Portability (size / weight) 4 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

The company that, for all intents and purposes, invented the DVR has, after 14 years, released one specifically designed for people who don't want to pay for a TV subscription. If you look past the marketing, the $50 TiVo Roamio OTA is actually the same as the standard-edition Roamio, but with a nonfunctional CableCARD slot and no option for Lifetime Service. So, is this the one box a cord-cutter needs? Just as important, is the price right? Gallery | 9 Photos TiVo Roamio OTA review + See all 9 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 76 TiVo Roamio OTA Pros Low initial cost No cable subscription required Streaming options and four OTA HD tuners Same software and accessories as the regular Roamio Cons $15 monthly service fee, with no Lifetime Service option No HDMI-CEC Summary TiVo's latest is the best over-the-air DVR ever made, but the $15 monthly service fee (combined with the lack of a Lifetime Service option) means you're trading a low upfront price for some high long-term costs. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware and remote On the outside, the TiVo Roamio OTA is identical to the standard edition. Same 3.7-pound, 14.3 x 7.4 x 1.9-inch box with an external power supply. Same recording indicator and power LEDs. The same WiFi (802.11a/b/g/n), Ethernet and port selection (USB, coax input, optical and analog audio out). It even requires the same $15 composite breakout cable if you prefer not to use HDMI. No HDMI-CEC either; again, just like other TiVos. It also comes with a 500GB hard drive, four tuners and the ability to expand via eSATA. Unlike its more expensive sibling, though, these tuners only capture over-the-air signals. The ability to tune into ATSC content is a strong suit here -- I didn't have any problem picking up broadcast channels in my area with a $15 RCA antenna or a more expensive one from Mohu Leaf. The box itself is physically appealing, with its glossy piano-black plastic, faceless TiVo guy and textured gray material. I appreciated TiVo's industrial design efforts when I first reviewed the Roamio Pro, and the fit and finish is just as welcome on the new OTA edition. I've always disliked external power supplies and while I've learned to live with them, I haven't stopped complaining about the accompanying tangle of wires. Unlike the Pro, the OTA doesn't feature MoCA, but that can be overcome with a $50 accessory adapter (with yet another external power supply). The OTA also doesn't have an integrated TiVo Stream (like the Plus and Pro do), so streaming to your mobile devices will run you another $130. The stubby peanut remote (as I like to call it) is the same as on the rest of the TiVo Roamio lineup. That means it's RF instead of IR, doesn't have a backlight and can only be programmed with IR codes of TVs and audio/video receivers from an included database. It can't learn to control your TV and AVR using your existing remotes, though. I'm not still holding out hope that TiVo will release an accessory remote with a backlight and the ability to learn, but without a slide-out keyboard, like back in the Series3 era. One small, but very useful feature that the Plus and Pro have that the lower-end Roamio DVRs don't is the remote finder. I can't tell you how useful I've found it to press a button on my Roamio Pro DVR and listen for the TiVo theme music to help me locate my missing remote. Software The TiVo Roamio OTA is also identical to its big brothers when it comes to software. It's every bit as fast, with the same features and the same third-party apps like Netflix and Hulu. Still, I'd like to take this opportunity to review the new features added to the Roamio lineup since I reviewed the Roamio Pro over a year ago. The two big additions are ones I've been complaining about as long as I can remember. The usefulness of the boring default Season Pass settings added in the spring 2014 release can't be overstated. I only wish I could get back all the time I've spent over the years setting every single Season Pass to keep all my recordings and to only record new episodes. Now, there's no longer a need to do this manually every time. It works exactly as you'd expect, in fact, but is limited to a few essential settings: record new and reruns, new only or everything; keep at most a number of episodes or all; and start or stop recording on time or add up to five minutes on either end. I'm not sure why TiVo didn't include the ability to choose a default \"keep until\" setting; maybe next year. The more interesting new feature came this summer and was quite overdue. Now the \"My Shows\" view makes it easier to sort through terabytes of recordings. In particular, a customizable third column lets you filter by category, as well as find episodes you didn't quite have time to finish. And the fact that it's configurable to the point it can be disabled completely means it's pretty much a complete win. Still, TiVo hasn't been successful at changing the way I find things to watch. The company has done some great things with What to Watch Now to help make the various viewing options slightly less overwhelming. This new third column in the UI improves things too, but I can't help but think there's more work to be done. It may be as simple as combining these two features into one. Perhaps a list view of What to Watch now (as opposed to icons) with the same configurable categories. I'm not sure, really, but the bottom line is: I like the direction TiVo is going in here and look forward to even more options for sifting through all that content. I'd be remiss if I didn't address the remaining standard-definition menus on the TiVo Roamio lineup. It seems some of the TiVo faithful are very upset that the time and care hasn't been taken to redesign every single menu of the TiVo experience in HD. But as a self-proclaimed HD snob, I can't say I agree. I understand it may annoy people when the UI switches back and forth, but at the same time, TiVo has to make difficult resource-allocation decisions; redesigning barely used UI elements is clearly not the best use of TiVo's time. Every new feature and setting is designed with HD in mind and it's surely just a matter of time before every menu gets the HD treatment -- it's only been four long years. The cord-cutter proposition The question TiVo hopes to answer is if the Roamio OTA will appeal to the estimated 7.6 million US households that don't subscribe to cable. Netflix, Hulu and the like get lots of credit for enabling people to watch TV without paying big bucks for a premium cable or satellite subscription. That means, though, that the antenna remains your best friend if you're a frugal TV fan. And just because you choose not to spend your hard-earned money subscribing to bunch of channels, that doesn't mean you don't want the 21st century luxury of a DVR. There's no shortage of startups attempting to fit this need, but unfortunately, when it comes to DVR functionality, most aren't even as good as the original TiVo from almost 14 years ago. Simple.TV, Channel Master, Tablo and others are doing their best, but are mostly just realizing how difficult it is to create a robust DVR platform. In particular, reliability, fit, finish and usability are usually second to content -- all areas where TiVo excels. Then again, though TiVo was one of the first to offer Netflix streaming almost six years ago, the company has fallen behind in more recent years with many, many missing options like: WatchESPN, Vudu, HBO Go, Amazon Prime, Epix, Crackle and CinemaNow. To be fair, not all of these will appeal to cord-cutters, as services likes WatchESPN and HBO GO require a cable subscription to watch (and who would ever borrow their friend's sign-in info?!). But the absence of Vudu and Amazon Prime are pretty glaring; I can only hope the rumors of these services coming to TiVo are true. Until that happens, though, you might be unlikely to get down to one box; you might additionally need a Roku, Fire TV or Apple TV. Then there are all those network apps, which would offer a good backup, in the event that your OTA setup lets you down. Even with the streaming options that TiVo does offer, there's room for improvement. Some of the streaming apps on TiVo aren't as good as the versions available on Roku and other boxes, with Pandora being one major example. Accessing these streaming services isn't as easy as it is on other boxes, but that has a lot to do with the fact that TiVo is a DVR first and a streamer second. On top of that, the user experience isn't as cohesive as the ones that the Xbox and Apple TV deliver since TiVo's streaming apps aren't customized to match the TiVo experience. Ultimately, the biggest problem with TiVo is the price. At $699 with Lifetime Service, the standard TiVo Roamio isn't exactly a low-cost solution and so TiVo hopes that it can entice cord-cutters with essentially the same box (for someone with no interest in paying for cable) for $50, plus $15 a month. The problem is the service charge, which almost no one believes is worth the price of a Netflix and Hulu subscription combined. The service, of course, is little more than a way for TiVo to subsidize the price of the hardware and provide people with a low upfront cost. But without a Lifetime Service option, you'd have to really be missing the big picture to go with the cord-cutter edition -- it takes about three and a half years at $15 a month to catch up to the $699 price of the standard Roamio with Lifetime. Wrap-up The TiVo Roamio OTA is interesting. Marketing a box to those who don't want to pay for cable while at the same time selling boxes to cable companies, and to customers of cable companies, is like walking a tightrope -- one I think is manageable. The real problem is that while I believe the TiVo Roamio is the best over-the-air DVR ever available, the low upfront cost isn't worth the higher total cost of ownership (the standard Roamio works with OTA or cable and is cheaper after three and a half years when you buy Lifetime Service). Then again, if you want a DVR without a cable subscription, the Roamio OTA is virtually your only option. What's more, it's not like you can completely replace it with a Roku or Apple TV; either way, you're going to sacrifice some content. An OTA DVR, for example, has access to live NFL on CBS each Sunday, but TiVo doesn't have nearly as many apps as either Roku or Apple. Given that, we'll say this: If you're interested in cutting the cord, but you're not ready to shell out hundreds up front on a regular TiVo box with Lifetime Service, then $50 to get started (plus $15 per month) isn't a terrible deal. But that's not saying much. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: hdpostcross, review, Roamio, RoamioOTA, TiVo, tivo roamio ota, TiVoRoamioOTA, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20971703 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20971703\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/tivo/roamio/\"> TiVo Roamio </a> TiVo Roamio Buy from $145 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/tivo/roamio/\" title=\"TiVo Roamio reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 2 </a> Prices Discussions Type High def DVR HD recording capacity 75 hours Number of digital tuners 4 Video outputs HDMI (1\u00a0outputs) Video services Netflix, Amazon, Video-on-demand Dimensions 7.4 x 14.4 x 1.8 in see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Ease of use 10 Design and form factor 10 Storage capacity 8 Expandability 9 Other features (networking, etc.) 8 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $145.00 + tax & shipping Buy now $159.99 + tax & shipping Buy now $199.99 + tax & shipping Buy now 54 Is TiVo really worth the money? 4 What is the next consumer tech gadget to fade into the past?

That review will need to wait until next month. What we have here is the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display. For all intents and purposes, it's the same one we last tested in late 2013, except for one important thing: It swaps out the old trackpad in favor of a pressure-sensitive \"Force Touch\" pad that responds differently depending on how hard you bear down on it. (A hard-press on the skip button in QuickTime, for instance, will let you fast-forward at warp speed.) In addition, the new MBP brings all the spec upgrades you'd expect in a system refresh, including faster SSDs, fresh graphics and Intel's latest Core processors. At $1,299-plus, it's priced the same as before, and since the design and Retina display haven't changed, you're likely to enjoy it as much as you did the last-gen model. I can't promise you'll love the new touchpad, though. Gallery | 19 Photos Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display review (13-inch, 2015) + See all 19 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 89 Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2015) Pros Gorgeous screen Long battery life Good graphics, even faster SSD speeds Comfortable keyboard Cons New trackpad takes getting used to; Force Touch gestures aren't that useful Discrete graphics still not an option on the 13-inch Pro The machine isn't any thinner or lighter than it was a year and a half ago Summary The refreshed Retina display MacBook Pro brings faster performance and longer battery life, along with the same stunning screen and comfortable keyboard. This time around, though, Apple also traded in its already-best-in-class trackpad for a new, pressure-sensitive one. While it's almost as comfortable to use as its predecessor, we're not convinced these new touchpad tricks were worth making the switch. That said, the 13-inch Retina MBP remains one of the few laptops of this size that offers such long battery life and this kind of\u00a0graphics clout. \u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware (but mostly the trackpad) If you already own a recent MacBook Pro, or have even futzed around an Apple Store, then you know what to expect here. The new MBP, like so many before it, is constructed from a seamless block of machined aluminum, with springy, well-spaced keys and a crisp 2,560 x 1,600 display, framed by a thin, barely there bezel. As before, the machine measures a slim 0.71 inch thick, though Apple is listing the weight as slightly heavier this time around: 3.48 pounds, as opposed to 3.46. Big whoop. Around the edges, you get the same selection of ports: two USB 3.0 connections, a full-sized HDMI socket, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, an SD card slot and a headphone jack. Nope, no USB Type-C ports like on the new MacBook -- at least not this time around. Oh, and the aluminum lid and chassis are still scratch-prone. With that, I am done talking about the MacBook Pro's hardware. Except for the new trackpad, of course. I have plenty more to say about that. For starters: What a risky thing for Apple to do, replacing the touchpad that's already the best in its class. Reviewers like it; users seem to like it. So what's the problem? If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? Right. Except for the fact that the Force Touch pad can do things the Mac regular trackpad can't. I already gave the example of pressing down on the skip keys in QuickTime to rewind or fast-forward at 60x speed. But there are other use cases: You can use the \"Force Click\" in Safari to get Wikipedia previews and word definitions. You can annotate in Mail and Preview. Speaking of Mail, you can Force Click on an address and see it in a pop-up map. You can also use it in Finder to preview files. And those are just built-in Mac apps; developers can build this feature into third-party apps as well. Before I get into the utility of all this, though, allow me to take a step back and explain how this thing works. Though it's about as spacious as the one on the old model, the new Force Touch pad does away with the old-school \"diving board\" -- the hinge mechanism that makes it easier to press down on the bottom portion of a touchpad than on the top. In fact, the trackpad here doesn't have any buttons; there's nothing to depress when you bear down with your finger. Instead, Apple fools you into believing you're clicking something. How? With the use of a \"Taptic Engine\" -- a bunch of wires coiled around a magnetic core that provide vibrating haptic feedback to match whatever you're doing onscreen. It's so convincing, in fact, that I would sometimes forget it wasn't a normal trackpad -- until I turned the machine off, anyway, and was left with a stiff piece of glass. That said, these \"button presses\" don't feel like using a touchpad on other MacBooks. If you're coming from an older model, as I am, you'll notice the new trackpad feels shallower; even though Apple makes it feel like you're clicking something, your finger isn't \"pressing down\" as far as it normally would. This was an adjustment for me, but I found a few ways to get past it. First off, I turned on the \"tap-to-click\" option in the settings, which helped me avoid \"clicking\" when it initially felt too weird. (To be fair, I always have tap-to-click enabled on my own Mac, so this didn't feel like much of a workaround for me.) Secondly, there's also an option in the settings to adjust the click pressure. Moving it from \"medium\" (the default) to \"light\" also helped soften the learning curve. Mostly, though, it just took time. After two days with the Force Touch pad, I was more or less used to it. Heck, if I weren't switching back and forth between the new Pro and my own MacBook Air, I might have adjusted even sooner. But back to my original question: Was this all worth it? Do the benefits of a pressure-sensitive touchpad outweigh the inconvenience of taking away the one people are used to? I'm not convinced they do. In Safari, at least, the novelty wore off quickly, particularly since it often took me several tries to get it right. Sure, it's cool to be able to Force Click on a word and be able to see a dictionary definition or a Wikipedia preview, but because I never fully got the hang of the gesture, it was far easier to just open a new browser tab and do a quick Google search. In that respect, the Force Touch pad didn't change my habits. Same with Finder: When you Force Click on a thumbnail to preview it, the actual \"preview\" is still small, unless you give it a second, harder press at which point it stretches to a fuller size. I'd still prefer to use a keyboard shortcut: hitting the space bar to open a much larger preview. I did enjoy the super-fast fast-forwarding, though. For me, at least, that might be the best and most practical reason to have a pressure-sensitive trackpad. Even so, the Force Touch feels like just another nice-to-have feature; I don't mind that it's there, and I ultimately got used to it, but it's also not something I particularly needed. It's certainly not essential on the level of the Retina display, which basically spoiled the lower-res MacBook Air screen for me and many other users. Every Mac should have a Retina panel; the Force Touch trackpad I can take or leave at this point. Performance and battery life OS X benchmarks Geekbench Xbench Battery life 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display (early 2015, 2.7GHz Core i5, Intel Iris 6100) 6,293 (32-bit) / 7,062 (64-bit) 487 11:23 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display (late 2013, 2.4GHz Core i5, Intel Iris graphics) 6,288 (32-bit) 428 11:18 13-inch MacBook Air (mid 2013, 1.3GHz Core i5, Intel HD Graphics 5000) 6,021 (32-bit) 304 12:51 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display (late 2012, 2.5GHz Core i5, Intel HD Graphics 4000) 6,812 (32-bit) 378 6:07 13-inch MacBook Pro (mid 2012, 2.5GHz Core i5, Intel HD Graphics 4000) 6,817 (32-bit) 368 6:51 13-inch MacBook Air (mid 2012, 1.8GHz Core i5, Intel HD Graphics 4000) 6,195 (32-bit) 321 6:34 The refreshed MacBook Pro arrives not long after Intel started shipping its fifth-generation Core processors, code-named \"Broadwell.\" As you'd expect, then, the Pro comes with your choice of new Core i5 and i7 chips, though only dual-core for now, as Intel hasn't released its quad-core Broadwell processors yet. Also not surprising: The performance boost is in many ways a fairly modest one. When Intel first announced these chips, it said we should only expect a 4 percent gain in productivity-oriented tasks. So it makes sense, then, that the MacBook Pro's results in general-performance benchmarks are only marginally better than they were a year and a half ago. Armed with a 2.7GHz Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, I saw less than a 100-point difference in tests like Geekbench and Xbench. That said, Broadwell promises some bigger gains in graphics -- after all, a whole two-thirds of the die area is dedicated to graphics. In particular, according to Intel, Broadwell machines should deliver a 22 percent improvement in 3D graphics benchmarks, and up to 50 percent faster video-conversion time. And the new MacBook Pro actually does most Broadwell machines one better: As before, it uses the chip maker's high-end \"Iris\" solution, instead of the usual Intel HD graphics. Given that the MBP is mainly intended for prosumers and creative pros, I decided to test the Iris 6100 graphics by loading up Final Cut Pro with a handful of 4K clips. Aside from one dropped frame -- brought on by trying to add a transition -- video playback was smooth. In fact, I was usually able to add effects in real time without causing any hiccups or slowdowns. In gaming, meanwhile, I saw a slight bump in Batman: Arkham City (the same game I used to test the late 2013 model), with frame rates rising from 32 fps to 33. Not really surprising, that: The Pro was never intended as a gaming machine, per se. Battery life Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2015) 11:23 MacBook Air (13-inch 2013) 12:51 HP Spectre x360 11:34 Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, late 2013) 11:18 Chromebook Pixel (2015) 10:01 Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus 8:44 Dell XPS 13 (2015) 7:36 Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro 7:36 Acer Aspire S7-392 7:33 Microsoft Surface Pro 3 7:08 Even more than the new processor, though, the biggest improvement might be disk speeds. Though the Retina display MacBook Pro has had PCIe-based SSDs (which are faster than mSATA ones) for about a year and a half now, Apple says the PCIe drives used in the latest MBP are twice as fast as the first PCIe SSDs used. Specifically, the company says its new disks can reach peak read speeds of 1.6 GB/s and max sequential write speeds of 1.5 GB/s. Indeed, in the Blackmagic disk test I got average read speeds of 1.3 GB/s, nearly matching the promised rate, although my write speeds came to an average of 643.6 MB/s. That's still higher than just about any other 13-inch laptop I've tested recently; I just couldn't reach those theoretical speeds of one and a half gigabytes per second. In real-world use, this translates to snappy performance, affecting everything from app load times to cold boot-ups (I recorded 13 seconds to get to the login screen). Apple says the new 13-inch Retina display MacBook Pro is capable of up to 10 hours of web browsing, or up to 12 hours of iTunes video playback. Sure enough, I logged 11 hours and 23 minutes in Engadget's video looping test, using an episode of Breaking Bad I purchased through iTunes. That does indeed match Apple's own estimate, and I suspect I could have actually broken the 12-hour mark had I not chosen such punishing battery settings. (As I do when I test Windows PCs, I kept the MacBook Pro from going to sleep or dimming its display when unplugged.) And hey, even 11.5 hours is impressive for a machine in this class -- the only other system I've seen recently that matches that is HP's Spectre x360. Still, I was surprised the battery didn't last even longer. First off, though the machine meets Apple's estimates, the Macs I've tested usually exceed expectations -- that's why the late 2013 model, which was rated for nine hours of runtime, actually clocked more than 11 hours. That brings me to point number two: The battery life here more or less matches what I got a year and a half ago. Also, to even achieve flat year-over-year battery life, I had to stick with iTunes; when I played movies through QuickTime and/or used a file I downloaded from somewhere else, the battery life was up to an hour shorter. To be fair, even Intel warned that battery life gains with Broadwell would be fairly modest over last year's processors, but still, I did expect more of an improvement. For the record, at least, other reviewers have noted bigger gains; I'm just not sure why I wasn't able to replicate their test results. I'll continue running some tests and will update this review if anything changes. Configuration options The 13-inch Retina display MacBook Pro starts at $1,299 with a 2.7GHz fifth-generation Intel Core i5 processor, Intel Iris Graphics 6100, 8GB of RAM and a 128GB PCIe-based solid-state drive. From there, you can upgrade to a slightly faster 2.9GHz Core i5 processor for an extra $100, or a 3.1GHz Core i7 CPU for $300. You can also double the RAM to 16GB for $200. Want more storage? Apple also sells a 256GB model ($1,499) and one with a 512GB SSD ($1,799). In the case of the $1,499 model, it has the same specs as the $1,299 variant, just with more storage. If you spring for the $1,799 model with 512GB of storage, though, you'll also get that slightly faster 2.9GHz processor. There's also a $500 1TB SSD option, but it's only offered as an upsell on the $1,799 model. One thing you won't find on the 13-inch Retina MBP: a discrete graphics option. That's only available on the 15-inch model, and even then, it'll cost you at least $2,499. The competition Mac diehards who want a laptop with decent graphics really only have one option: the Retina display MacBook Pro. For those of you who are more OS agnostic, though, you have a few other good PC options. Most don't have quite the same graphics clout as the 13-inch Retina MBP, but they do at least offer similarly sharp screens, premium build quality and long battery life. My personal favorites: the Dell XPS 13 ($800-plus) and HP Spectre x360 ($900-plus). Starting with the Dell, it weighs 2.6 pounds and has a nearly bezel-less (up to 3,200 x 1,800) display that allows it to have a much smaller footprint than a typical 13-inch laptop. All told, it earned a score of 90 in our review, thanks not just to the compact design and crisp screen, but also a comfortable keyboard, fast performance and surprisingly good audio. My only real pet peeve may have been the occasionally temperamental touchpad. As for the Spectre, it has a 2,560 x 1,440 screen option and a machined aluminum build that some might say was inspired by the MacBook itself. I haven't published my review yet (working on it!), but I can tell you now, the battery life is impressive: about 11.5 hours of video playback in my tests. It's also lighter than the MacBook Pro, with the weight ranging from 3.17 to 3.26 pounds, depending on the configuration. Again, still polishing off my review, but I think it's safe to say this is a solid option if you're looking for a premium, high-performing 13-inch machine. If, in the end, you find graphics don't matter that much -- and that you can maybe even live without the sharp screen -- Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air is cheaper, at $999. It's also lighter with longer battery life. And it has the old touchpad too, if that's what you prefer, but again, you'd be giving up that sharp screen to get it. Decisions, decisions... Wrap-up The refreshed Retina display MacBook Pro is mostly an incremental improvement over the previous model, with even faster disk speeds and stronger graphics, along with the same comfortable keyboard, slim design, long battery life and stunning screen. The only area where the MBP represents a possible step backward is the touchpad. To Apple's credit, the pressure-sensitive Force Touch pad is interesting, and has the potential to become more useful as third-party developers start to incorporate the \"Force Click\" into their own apps. In fact, I'm still curious to see what a potential Force Touch iPhone might look like; perhaps the tech would make more sense there, where having pressure sensitivity doesn't mean forfeiting a best-in-class trackpad. Right now, though, Force Touch feels like a solution to a problem I'm not sure anyone had. At worst, it's a gimmick; at best, it's a nice-to-have feature. Either way, although the new touchpad doesn't feel quite the same as the ol' \"diving board,\" you should at least get used to it quickly. In the end, too, despite its flaws (the shallower touchpad, the continued lack of a discrete graphics option), the 13-inch Retina display stands as one of the only laptops of this size that offers this level of portability, screen quality and graphics power, not to mention this nice a screen. If you need a lightweight machine with enough processing clout for a little 4K video editing, this is still one of your best bets. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: apple, forcetouch, MacbookPro, MacbookProWithRetinaDisplay, retinadisplay, RetinaDisplayMacbookPro, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21157957 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21157957\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/apple/macbook-pro/15-inch-with-retina-display/mid-2014/\"> Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch with Retina Display (mid 2014) </a> Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch with Retina Display (mid 2014) 256GB 512GB Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/apple/macbook-pro/15-inch-with-retina-display/mid-2014/\" title=\"Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch with Retina Display (mid 2014) reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 5 </a> Prices Discussions Type Midsize Screen size 15.4 inches Screen resolution Other System RAM 16 GB Maximum battery life Up to 8 hours Dimensions 0.71 x 14.13 x 9.73 in Weight 4.46 lb Released 2014-07-29 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Speed and features 10 Design and form factor 9.2 Battery life 8.8 Display 9.6 Durability 8.8 Expandability 5.6 Noise 10 Portability (size / weight) 9.2 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 1 Should I wait for new MacBook Pro 15'' retina or buy the current one 2 Is Apple losing their focus on hardware? 7 Why Are Apple Haters so Vicious?

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/03/parrot-zik-2-0-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "November 3rd 2014 at 8:00 am", "body": " If you're into drones and wireless audio, then you'll probably agree that Parrot is the best thing out of France since Daft Punk. Personally, I've been most impressed with the company's wireless headphones, the Zik. In fact, I've been a regular user since it came out about two years ago. Even today, no other brands have attempted anything as advanced as these cans. Which makes sense: These are no ordinary Bluetooth headphones. In addition to being wireless, they feature effective noise cancellation and intuitive touchpad input, all tucked inside a quirky Philippe Starck design, no less. More importantly, the audio quality has gotten better over time as Parrot improved device compatibility via firmware updates. But of course, there's always room for improvement; the original Zik is on the heavy side, and not everyone's a fan of its bulky look. Well, that's pretty much why we now have the Zik 2.0, and fortunately, it offers more than just improved portability. Read on to see if this new model is worth the $399 upgrade. Gallery | 22 Photos Parrot Zik 2.0 review + See all 22 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 88 Parrot Zik 2.0 Pros Impressive noise reduction Intuitive gesture-based control Great audio playback quality Cons Touchpad not as sensitive as before Charging takes 2.5 hours Still not ideal for voice calls Summary The Parrot Zik 2.0 is almost perfect with its reduced weight, refined design and new app features, but its call quality could use work. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware The Zik 2.0 is essentially a lighter, more rounded and thus better-looking version of the first-gen Zik; and don't forget that it also comes in white, blue, mocha, orange and yellow. Our pre-production unit weighs 274 grams (it's officially 270 grams), a 17 percent reduction from the 327-gram original (325 grams officially). The difference was immediately noticeable when I first put on the new model. It feels more comfortable and secure thanks to the extra padding on the head rail, as well as the more spacious memory foam cushions. I can now lean backward or forward without the fear of gravity pulling off my headphones. Another notable change is that the oval cups are now covered with soft, faux-leather material instead of hard plastic, which adds some warmth to both the look and feel. Gallery | 10 Photos Parrot Zik vs. Zik 2.0 + See all 10 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") The general feature set and layout remain unchanged. Both cups are pivoted on the signature bone-shaped, extendable aluminum arms, and they each house a 40mm neodymium driver with a frequency response range between 20Hz and 22kHz -- a bit lacking on treble which is a common limitation on noise-cancelling headphones. The left cup contains the removable 830mAh battery and the NFC coil, whereas the right cup carries the fully disguised touchpad, two bone-conduction microphones, a larger power button (with LED indicator), micro-USB port (for charging and updating firmware) and 3.5mm line-in socket (you can use that with the bundled 1.3m audio cable). I'm not exactly sure where it is, but there's also a \"presence sensor\" somewhere inside the right ear cushion that automatically pauses your music when you take the Zik off, which is a thoughtful feature. What's new is that there are now six noise-canceling microphones split between the cans instead of four, thus allowing the new Zik to reduce up to 30 dB of ambient noise instead of just 25 dB (more on that later). It's also worth mentioning that the removable cover on the left cup -- with a large \"Parrot\" logo embossed -- has a more secure fit thanks to an extra magnet plus its new shape. So far, I haven't accidentally brushed it off, something that I often did with my first-gen Zik. Just like the original, the Zik 2.0 is easy to set up. You can either tap your NFC-enabled Android phone on the left cup for automatic Bluetooth pairing, or search for the headphones from your device's Bluetooth menu. Unlike some other Bluetooth audio hardware, the Zik doesn't require you to put it into pairing mode. In fact, it doesn't have one. What's more, even if you've already paired it with another device, the Zik is always discoverable on boot, so you can pair it with a new device provided the previous is disconnected or powered off. As for the swipe gestures, it's again more of the same: Slide from back to front to skip a song, or the other way round to go back; slide up or down to adjust the volume; tap to play or pause, and the same for answering or ending phone calls; tap twice to reject an incoming call; and long-press to toggle your phone's voice assistant, be it Siri or Google Now. My only niggle here is that the touchpad is less sensitive than before: If I swipe with the same amount of force I'm used to from the past two years, the new Zik either misses my gesture or mistakes it for a tap, which became annoying after a short while. So I now have to swipe slower and with a little more force applied. Maybe that new faux-leather wrap is getting in the way; or maybe it's an intentional modification, as my original Zik is also susceptible to accidental swipes due to its greater sensitivity. Still, I'd prefer to swipe with less effort if given the choice. Software The Zik 2.0 will work just fine out of the box, but in order to make the most of it, you'll need to install the free namesake companion app (not to be confused with Parrot Audio Suite) on your Android or iOS device (Windows Phone support coming soon). After all, the software is really where the money is: This is where you can toggle and tweak the headphones' noise cancellation, concert hall effects (which I tend not to use), equalizer and audio presets. And for the record, yes, the Zik stores all your settings. Gallery | 11 Photos Parrot Zik 2.0 app screenshots + See all 11 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Upon launch, the app detects whether your mobile device is connected to a Zik 2.0, after which it'll take you to a page showing how much battery is left, which features are active and what song you're listening to. Swiping horizontally takes you to the pages dedicated to the aforementioned features, and the Settings menu lets you toggle the presence sensor, auto power-off timer, Bluetooth auto connect, caller ID text-to-speech service and firmware update. There are a couple of interesting improvements here. For instance, you can now adjust the level of noise reduction -- from \"Street mode,\" for safety's sake, all the way up to 30 dB. Compared to my first-gen Zik (which already aced the noise-cancellation feature on the Sennheiser and Bose headphones from the same generation), that extra 5 dB makes a noticeable difference, and I look forward to taking advantage of this on my next flight. Another handy addition is the new simplified equalizer. Rather than fiddling with frequency settings in a chart, you can just slide a pointer across \"Pop,\" \"Vocal,\" \"Cristal,\" \"Club,\" \"Punchy\" and \"Deep\" within a circular heat map to suit your taste. Personally, I found my sweet spot to be somewhere on the outer edge between \"Punchy\" and \"Club.\" For those who prefer a higher level of customization, you can still use the classic line chart equalizer (along with the concert hall effect tool) to create your own audio preset. Alternatively, you can also download some presets from artists featured by Parrot within the app (selections include DJ Jazzy Jeff, Andrew Watt, Philippe Cohen-Solal, Richard Dorfmeister and, yes, Conchita Wurst). At some point in the near future, you'll be able to share your presets with others as well. Zik 2.0 also has a smart new feature called Smart Audio Tuning, which can automatically apply audio presets to music that matches certain criteria, be it by artist, album, song or genre. So hold this thought for a second: What Parrot's offering is a platform that lets artists personally tune your headphones to best suit their own songs or albums. Regardless of traction, there's no arguing that this is a pretty neat idea, so hopefully Parrot can throw in more big names to get the momentum going. General use and sound quality With the exception of the touchpad's sensitivity issue I mentioned earlier, I'm otherwise very pleased with the Zik 2.0. First of all, the 830mAh battery still manages about six to seven hours of continuous playback if you have Bluetooth, noise reduction and concert hall mode enabled. Alternatively, you can get up to a staggering 18 hours with the new flight mode (no Bluetooth, no concert hall effect; just a wired connection with noise cancellation). Alas, it takes 2.5 hours to recharge the depleted battery, and to make matters worse, Parrot still doesn't offer a dedicated charger for those who carry a spare battery. Luckily, the great audio quality almost makes up for it, but that's not without my own equalizer settings: I prefer just a little more punch and treble on top of the default profile. Having said that, compared to its predecessor, the Zik 2.0 definitely has more resolution in the treble space and is less muddy overall. Given the limitation in the frequency response, the new Zik is still ever so slightly muffled in the high frequencies than, say, my KEF M200 in-ears that I use regularly, though it's barely discernible when you're out and about. It should also be noted that you can use the Zik sans battery, aka in passive line-in mode, but the audio quality is nowhere as good without the digital signal processor and noise reduction running. Many have asked Parrot to add aptX for potentially better streaming quality, but sadly, that still hasn't happened. In fact, when I spoke to Parrot CEO Henri Seydoux two years ago, he insisted that aptX isn't needed to achieve good streaming quality. With aptX becoming the norm these days (and more so once Qualcomm's acquired its maker, CSR), maybe he'll reconsider? I'll take whatever to retrieve the missing treble bits. Last but not least: call quality. The Zik 2.0 actually supports HD Voice which, as you can guess, enables much clearer voice calls, though you do need to have a phone and a carrier that support the standard as well. Alas, I have neither, so call performance is about the same as what we got with the original Zik: My voice is often staticky, especially in noisy environments, and sometimes too quiet on the other end. I tend to just grab my phone out to pick up calls to save the embarrassment, which is a bit ridiculous given how much these headphones cost. Wrap-up Parrot is so close to making the perfect Bluetooth headphones. Well, they pretty much are if you ignore the voice-calling feature and just use them for music. Put it this way: The original Zik remained the most advanced Bluetooth headphones for two years straight, and now we have a new version that's better-looking, more comfortable to wear and even better at noise cancellation, to the point where it's arguably best in class. As a bonus, the cans come with more tuning options to entertain obsessed audiophiles on the road. They also offer artists a new way of interacting with their fans by letting them share their very own audio presets, which can also be set to target specific songs and albums. This social element might be perceived as a gimmick, but even so, you gotta admire Parrot for thinking out of the box. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: bluetooth, featured, features, headphones, NoiseCancelling, parrot, review, uk-reviews, wirelessheadphones, zik, zik2.0 \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20987357 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20987357\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/parrot/zik/\"> Parrot Zik </a> Parrot Zik Buy from $281 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/parrot/zik/\" title=\"Parrot Zik reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 16 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Over-ear Talk time up to 5 hours Announced 2012-01-10 see all specs \u2192 8.8average user rating Voice / mic quality 8 Noise reduction 8.8 Sound quality 8.6 Battery life 7.5 Comfort 8.1 Durability 8.9 Design and form factor 9.5 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $281.70 + tax & shipping Buy now 1 Release Date 3 First on GDGT!

Right now -- today -- that is possible. It doesn't cost $10,000 and it doesn't come with caveats like, \"This is made for developers.\" Samsung is officially the first to market with an accessible, impressive virtual reality headset, all powered by software from Facebook's recently acquired Oculus VR team. That alone is very exciting: We are standing at the precipice of a new medium, finally technologically possible. Wireless, consumer-grade virtual reality! In your home! Today! Samsung's Gear VR is both an astounding feat and an illuminating vision into our near future; it's the closest anyone's come to making virtual reality into a palatable consumer experience, and a stark example of how far we still have to go before that dream is completely realized. Gallery | 22 Photos Samsung Gear VR \"Innovator Edition\" review + See all 22 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 77 Samsung & Oculus VR Samsung Gear VR \"Innovator Edition\" Pros Incredibly accessible Light, comfortable, attractive Extremely impressive visuals Cons Limited functionality Extremely limited software library Requires a Note 4, making it very expensive Summary Oculus VR and Samsung's Gear VR virtual reality headset is an enticing first taste of the potential future of a new medium. It's light, comfortable and -- most importantly -- accessible. Gear VR is the most usable\u00a0virtual reality headset we've ever tried, and the first to market after several years of hype. At the same time, an extremely limited selection of software and functionality makes Gear VR live up to its \"Innovator Edition\" alias: It's a device intended for early adopters and virtual reality enthusiasts, not the mainstream. At least for now. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") If you're looking for guidance on whether or not you should buy a $200 Gear VR headset to strap your $700 Galaxy Note 4 into, this isn't the review for you. Frankly, it's a lot to pay for the experience, and I don't feel comfortable suggesting anyone shell out that kind of cash for Gear VR. And let's be honest: The folks who would drop that kind of money for the promise of Gear VR are crazy people like me. They've already bought one. Samsung intentionally dubbed Gear VR's first iteration the \"Innovator Edition.\" There's good reason for that: It's more tech demo than consumer product right now. Save for a few games, the app store consists of just over a dozen \"experiences\"; every other \"game\" is a demo at this point. To be clear up front, Gear VR is not intended as a mainstream consumer device; it's a test balloon from one of the world's largest electronics manufacturers. Here's what Nick DiCarlo, VP/GM of immersive products and VR at Samsung, told me last week about his company's goal with Gear VR: \"The gauge of success is about did people who bought it like it and did they not return 100 percent of them. It's as simple as that. If someone bought it and liked it and told their friends about it and thought it was cool? Awesome! If we get it back and everyone's like, 'This doesn't work well; I don't like it; it's horrible.' Then we know we've got a lot more room to improve than we thought. We think that we've hit the formula, but the idea is that we're able to move VR forward -- 'existence-proof,' to steal a word from John Carmack. VR exists! Thank goodness it finally exists! We think people are gonna really, really like it, but we know that there's a lot of room to continue to make it better and we will do that.\" It's not being sold at your local Best Buy, and for good reason. Samsung intentionally didn't send out review units to press before Gear VR went on sale; the point wasn't to bury reviews, but to discourage them altogether. The idea is that the people who buy this early will evangelize it to their friends, helping to build a virtual reality market that companies like Samsung can profit from. There are Gear VR setups in malls all over the world. It's meant to be a demonstrative device. That it's on sale is just the easiest way for Samsung to distribute it to evangelists. But it is on sale to the public. With that in mind, I'm taking a dual approach to this review: one perspective for the VR enthusiast, and another for the average human being. Getting acquainted with virtual reality through Gear VR For the average human being First, you must own a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 smartphone. Second, you must make sure it's up to date with the latest firmware from your carrier. Third, you must insert the 16GB microSD card that comes with Gear VR into your phone. The phone both powers VR experiences and acts as the Gear VR's screen. There's no real \"setup\" required; after you've removed the miles of plastic protection stuck to various regions of the headset, you simply attach your Note 4 to the front of the shell. After removing the slightly darkened front plastic casing, you'll see a docking area for the phone. On the left side of the front is a micro-USB plug where you carefully dock your Note 4, screen facing inward; on the right side, there's a latch on a flexible-yet-sturdy rocker for securing the phone to the headset. It's not perfectly slick, but it works significantly better than any other VR setup I've been through. Once docked, an audible jingle plays through the phone's built-in speaker to let you know the headset is ready for use. After you've adjusted the headset to your liking, the first instructions are to remove the phone and go through the software install process. It's thankfully quick: You're downloading the basics, from the operating system (\"Oculus Home\") to the video player (\"Gear VR Video\"). After that's complete, you're basically ready to go -- slap the headset on your head with the phone attached and adjust the Velcro straps to your comfort. When you put it on your face, the sensor built into the headset's interior detects that you're close and starts loading into the main menu. That's it! You're in! If you want to run through a quick tutorial of how to use the headset, Samsung has one ready for you. The long and short is this: Swiping on the touchpad (located on the right side of the headset, where your temple would be) advances forward to the next menu; tapping on the touchpad selects whatever you're looking at (it's used for pausing movies and in-game actions, among other things); a single \"back\" button (ridged for quick location) rests above the touchpad and can be pushed (to go back or to cancel) or held (to reach a sub-menu from within games/apps). There's a volume rocker in front of that. Congratulations: You know the full scope of operating Gear VR. Seriously! Should you choose to pair a Bluetooth controller to your Note 4 (either before connecting the headset or during use), the main Oculus Home area can be navigated using the controller's left analog stick. That said, it's a lot more fun pointing your head at stuff and tapping the touchpad, like some sort of wizard. Does the setup process seem a bit convoluted as a result of having to attach and detach your phone to the headset a few times? Sure. Is it difficult or confusing? Nope! In fact, it's far easier than setting up the Note 4 itself -- far fewer menus to click through and less nonsense to deal with. Whether it was Oculus, Samsung or some mix of both that was responsible, Gear VR is thankfully streamlined from the start to get users acquainted with VR as soon as humanly possible. If it feels bare-bones, that's assuredly intentional -- the goal here is accessibility. For the VR enthusiast There's never been an easier setup in the (very short) recent history of virtual reality headsets. Provided that your Note 4 firmware is up to date, it's a matter of slapping the headset into the holder on the front and following instructions (detailed above). Gear VR is not a dev kit and you don't have to spend a bunch of time updating firmware, calibrating cameras and testing resolution settings. In my experience -- which included updating the firmware on the Note 4 -- setup took around 15 minutes, including time to download/install firmware (which required a hardware restart) and also the headset's software suite. Maybe you want to use a Bluetooth gamepad, which some games require? Just pair it with your Note 4 and you're good to go. Perhaps you want to wear headphones while using Gear VR, for the Maximum Immersion Experience\u2122 (seen above)? Just plug in your cans to the exposed one-eighth-inch audio jack. And yes, you can leave the translucent plastic cover off the front of your Gear VR pretty much permanently -- it's solely an aesthetic choice and, if anything, kinda gets in the way. It does make the headset prettier while in use, but are you really that concerned about your looks while wearing a VR headset? No one is immune to (what I'm calling) Headset Hair. Life in virtual reality For the average human being Like smartwatches, virtual reality headsets don't have enough functionality to outright replace other electronics usage -- especially your smartphone. You can't answer a phone call, text message or email while wearing Gear VR, though you can see them pop up in your peripheral vision. It's an incredible tease: A green phone icon appears, which expands with more information about the caller when you look at it. The only options as of now are to end the call with a tap on the touchpad or outright remove your phone from the headset to answer the call. I'd be incredibly impressed if you're able to remove the phone in time to answer phone calls without accidentally hanging up on the caller in the process. It's simply not a realistic option, and it's the kind of rough edge that explains the \"Innovator Edition\" name. In this respect, Gear VR doesn't necessarily slide right into your life. It's still a device that requires dedicated use, like a game console or a camera; it's not viable to use as a replacement device just yet. The foundations of that functionality are in place; that you can see rich information about phone calls, text messages and emails (\"notifications\") is a great start. It's a taste of a future where you casually pause whatever you're doing in VR -- from walking around virtual Rome to watching House of Cards in a virtual 4K movie theater -- to take a phone call or watch a silly YouTube link your friend sent you. Software like VR Gallery and Oculus Cinema lay the groundwork for a future where your vacation photos exist in an ornate virtual gallery space, and where family movies are viewed in a theater setting. It's impossible to convey how much joy it brought me to watch a silly 10-second video I shot of my cat with the Note 4 -- I went from shooting a video with my phone to watching it in a massive virtual theater (pictured below) in less than one minute. Little touches like that offer an amuse-bouche to the feast of virtual reality experiences to come. I cannot be clear enough here: VR will live and die by its ability to integrate into normal life. It will remain a novelty if it is solely focused on immersion -- the ever-marketable \"presence\" -- rather than enabling new ways to interact with the things we all already know and love. Things like home movies and photos are a huge part of the reason for the explosion of the smartphone. VR is more than capable of taking that stuff a step further, and Gear VR is indeed a big push forward, but it's not all there yet. In the short run, new experiences like Oculus 360 Photos and Oculus 360 Videos -- especially the latter -- are incredibly enticing. You might think that being able to look around a photo in every direction isn't that exciting -- I challenge you to try it and remain unimpressed. That impact is multiplied greatly when using the 360 video player: There's a tour of Iceland from the foot of a helicopter that is both gorgeous and incredibly intense. Look in any direction, as if it was real life, and you've got an incredible view. The promise of virtual tourism is tremendous; the feeling of awe you experience when looking down from a cliff face or squaring up to a massive waterfall is truly extraordinary. You can almost taste the moisture in the air, feel the cold breeze as you fly below the clouds attached to a heli. It's an overwhelming sensory experience. Samsung offers a taste of that experience when you first put on Gear VR, as seen below in the intro video. #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-409966{display:none;} .cke_show_borders #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-409966, #postcontentcontainer #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-409966{width:570px;display:block;} try{document.getElementById(\"fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-409966\").style.display=\"none\";}catch(e){} {C}{C}\nFor some people, that experience might outright cause motion sickness. I was fine, but some colleagues I put into the headset -- specifically with 360 video viewing -- felt nauseous. \"Your mileage may vary\" is the clich\u00e9 nonsense to say here, and it's sadly accurate: Different people respond differently to virtual reality, and some folks are far more sensitive to the motion sickness effect. If you're feeling sick while using Gear VR (or any VR headset), the solution is thankfully simple: Remove the headset and chill out for a second. For the VR enthusiast Good news, VR enthusiast: Everything is free on the Gear VR app store and downloading/installing/maintaining software is as easy as it is on your smartphone. There's a paid store coming in \"early 2015,\" but for now, there are just over a dozen things to download for use with Gear VR. A handful are \"experiences,\" both interactive and not: a snippet from Cirque du Soleil, a Pacific Rim jaeger pilot demo and an Avengers... thing are all highlights. The other content is mostly game demos, with a few full games to offer a taste of the upcoming storefront (head below for more detail on individual games). Jumping in and out of software on Gear VR isn't quite as easy as it is on your phone, or even your game console. If you start an app in Gear VR, you're in it until you close it. There's only a bare minimum of multitasking available, such as the aforementioned notification pop-ups. You're not going to quickly jump from one app to another and then back again without starting each app from scratch each time. Thankfully, software opens quickly and I rarely found myself sitting around waiting for an app to load. This will assuredly become a bigger problem as virtual reality headsets do a better job of integrating into normal life -- it's gonna be a big problem if, say, Netflix has to be fully restarted each time you want to quickly look at Twitter. That's a scenario we're likely to see sooner than later, as even the first iteration of the Oculus Cinema app makes it clear that consuming media is going to be a major use case for VR headsets. Lying on my back, watching a movie in a virtual cinema is an incredible experience, and one that I'm confident other folks will also dig. It's a dramatically better experience than watching video on your phone. Here's famed movie director and Twin Peaks co-creator David Lynch reminding us how good that experience is: And he's right! I think Lynch would agree, though, that Oculus Cinema (to say nothing of 360 video viewing) is a dramatic improvement over watching video on a phone. Hell, it's an improvement over watching video on your home TV -- unless you've got a home cinema? Maybe you do, fancy pants! I don't, and neither do most people. This functionality alone has me anxiously anticipating YouTube, Netflix, Hulu and other video apps. UI, battery life and passthrough Like most aspects of Gear VR, the operating system is relatively skeletal. There's the \"store,\" which looks the same as the \"library.\" There's the \"home\" screen, which is very similar looking to the other two. And that's really it. Here's a mockup of the Store screen from Oculus: In actuality, the Store screen isn't on a slant; none of the games above are available; and there's a lot less unused space. There's no way to take screengrabs within Gear VR, and Oculus/Samsung aren't providing images, so, uh, the best we've got is words and the mockup seen above. It's not an ideal situation. Regardless, the general layout isn't far off, and the option to switch between Samsung-curated and Oculus-curated apps is the only filter within the Store page. The Library is identical, except you can filter among installed apps, all available/purchased apps and an updates section. In both the Store and the Library, each app has its own page with options for more info, images of the app, potentially video of it in action and an updates section. It looks and acts a lot like any app page you've encountered on your phone or game console or wherever else, with one exception: There's a \"comfort\" rating. It ranges from comfortable \"for most\" to comfortable \"for few\" -- yet another nod to the early nature of Gear VR. Like a game console, the Home screen has your most recently used apps: Six applications are arranged in the center area, with links to the store on the left and your library of software on the right. Selecting anything is as simple as looking at it and tapping the touchpad. You can't rearrange the locations of various apps, nor can you resize them or \"pin\" any to the home screen. There's no way to change the background or really customize the UI in any way. I'm not citing this as a limitation, but to say that the UI is extremely lightweight and focused. Again, it's clear that this is the base level for consumer-grade functionality. But wait, there's a second UI. Scandalous! Okay, not so scandalous -- it's a sub-UI that can be accessed from within running software. This is where that back button comes into play once again: Holding down the button brings up the sub-UI, which offers a handful of toggles on the fly. Think of the sub-UI as a quick-access option for several important functions, so that you don't have to dump all the way back to the Oculus Home OS every time you want to make minor tweaks to settings (or to access the passthrough camera, which is genuinely very useful). Maybe you'd like a sip of water? The sub-UI has a passthrough camera switch, which turns on the Note 4's rear camera and pumps the stream into the headset. You essentially see \"through\" the headset you've got on, albeit slightly delayed due to video latency. It's kind of like being Robocop? I'm not sure how else to describe that, as I've never seen the world through the eyes of a camera before. Or maybe the screen is too bright? This is where you can turn it down. There's also an option to reorient the headset, and a \"comfort mode\" setting (which softens the screen colors). Let's talk about that passthrough camera for a second: There is no way any VR headset ships to consumers without this feature going forward. If they do, they're flawed out of the box. The passthrough camera is Gear VR's greatest contribution to modern virtual reality -- beyond wireless VR, beyond accessibility. Oculus VR CTO and Gear VR lead John Carmack called it his \"Diet Pepsi button.\" There's good reason for that: The passthrough camera legitimately enables you to take a sip of a drink without having to remove your VR headset. It enables you to pet your dog, or answer your husband in the other room, or the myriad other actions you might want to do without having to take off your VR headset. It genuinely alters how you interact in actual reality while wearing a virtual reality headset. It's hard to be hyperbolic here about the importance of the passthrough camera: It is precedent-setting. Games I'm not going to review every single game for Gear VR, mostly because the vast majority are demos. Moreover, literally everything is free on Gear VR's \"store\" right now, so, ya know, why not just download everything? You certainly won't run into file-size limitations. Seriously, you should do that. It's less than 20 apps, and many are short experiences. Let's start with the not-so-short: Herobound: First Steps is the first game officially released by Oculus VR. It was developed in-house, and has players guiding a small hero character from room to room, taking on everything from skeletons to ghosts. It's kind of like a prettied-up, dumbed-down, modern version of the original Legend of Zelda game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. I'm being far too generous in that comparison, but I mean that to say it's a \"single screen\" game; your view of the world is that of a giant, looking down into little rooms full of tiny characters. It's a fine distraction, but does little to engage the VR headset you're playing it on. Ikarus is a much better example of what can be done, gaming-wise, in Gear VR. In Ikarus (which is a demo), you're once again viewing the world from the bird's-eye view, and you're using vision to guide a place marker where you'll send your in-game avatar. The goal in Ikarus is to get from one side of a level to another without getting your defenseless character killed by robots. When you do complete an area, you're rewarded with a first-person cutscene as your character is whisked from one area to the next. It's beautiful and engaging and exactly the kind of unique experience I'm looking to have with mobile VR. Dreadhalls is one of several demos that made its way from Oculus' development kits (in the hands of indie devs) to Gear VR. It's one of the few that requires a gamepad to play (I used a Moga Pro, which worked great), and it's the only game available right now attempting to scare players. Even with muddy textures and rudimentary \"monsters,\" Dreadhalls is terrifying. As in \"people rip the headset off while they're playing it\" kind of terrifying. When a floating orb with sharp teeth comes floating directly at your face, even though you know it's not real, you react like it is. There are huge, glaring flaws with Dreadhalls: It makes people sick; it bucks the best practices of VR by assigning the headset's view to a gamepad analog stick (read: You can \"look\" in game by turning your head and/or by pushing an analog stick); and it doesn't work well, mechanically speaking. All of those flaws are dramatically superseded by Dreadhalls' ability to scare the crap out of you far more effectively than multimillion-dollar horror films. Esper is my favorite game available for Gear VR. It's a puzzle game that feels thematically similar to the humor in Portal, with unnamed scientists hilariously goading you through \"tests\" required of people with telekinesis. Apparently humans gained the ability recently and an agency was set up to familiarize people with their newfound powers. Sure, it's a silly premise, but the humor is genuinely funny and the puzzles make great, unique use of the VR headset. Proton Pulse is Breakout, but in 3D and your \"paddle\" is controlled by where you look. It's not \"like\" Breakout -- it's the same game, updated for 3D and VR. That's not to say it's unoriginal and it's certainly not to say that it's not a fun game. On the contrary, Proton Pulse is excellent: a fun, fast-paced game that's perfect for a few minutes of free time. It is unfortunately buggy at the moment (it's the only game to hard crash my Note 4), but that's easily fixed by updates. Darknet is one of the few full games available, and it's the evolution of the winning entry in Oculus' VR Jam. It's a hacking game that looks like the way hacking is depicted in film: hilariously visual and inaccurate, but a lot more fun to look at. It's much easier to spend a lot of time in Darknet than many other games within Gear VR, mostly because it's not a \"world\" as much as it is a UI as a game. There are, of course, several other games on Gear VR, none of which are outright terrible. There are no games that you shouldn't bother checking out right now, mostly because there are so few games period. Rest assured we'll have a more critical guide when the actual Gear VR store launches with paid apps in the coming months. Wrap-up Gear VR is a device full of potential. It works! The screen resolution is almost good enough that you don't constantly think about the headset you're wearing! It's light and easy to keep on for long periods! It's not $10,000! The battery life is pretty okay (seriously, if you're burning out your Note 4 from Gear VR use, you need to take more frequent breaks)! It's also a device still full of limitations. When you're in Gear VR, you're in Gear VR -- no answering phone calls or looking at the internet or anything else you do with your phone. The list of software -- right now -- is insanely short. It only works with a single phone, and that phone is incredibly expensive off-contract. And it's not exactly tiny: Gear VR comes with its own carrying case that doesn't fit into any normal-sized bags. The Back to the Future 2 glasses these are not. But should you buy it? Whether or not you should buy Gear VR is difficult to answer at the moment. For those of us already drinking the Kool-Aid of virtual reality as a medium, it's by far the most impressive consumer experience and every bit worth owning. I'd even venture as far as to say it's worth owning a Note 4 so that VR enthusiasts can own Gear VR, which is saying a lot considering how much I don't like the Note 4. But for the average consumer, Gear VR will feel half-done, or like a tech demo. It's a great jumping-off point for VR nutcases like myself to easily evangelize and demonstrate the promise of virtual reality. But Gear VR is still several steps removed from the level of polish and functionality consumers expect. So, should you buy it? Like so many things, it depends on you. What I can say definitively is that Gear VR offers a unique, amazingly demonstrative experience of what virtual reality headsets can be. Whether or not you buy one doesn't really matter -- you must try one.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/06/sony-xperia-z3-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "October 6th 2014 at 12:00 pm", "body": " When you're trying to compete in the phone-making game, there are certain challenges. On the one hand, you want to dazzle customers with innovative features. On the other hand, you want to keep the suit-wearing shareholders happy with growth and strong, continued sales. The bottleneck in this equation is often technology. You can't force it to progress. So once you've more or less caught up, you're left with a choice: Innovate with software/hardware design, or take a risk with gimmicky features. Any of the above will do in lieu of the (unspeakable) alternative -- not releasing a new model this year. We're not trying to preload this review of Sony's new Z3 flagship, which arrives barely six months after its predecessor. Or maybe we are. What we're definitely doing is spelling it out right here in the intro: The Z3 looks a lot like the Z2, and after a quick glance at the spec sheet, you might argue it sounds a lot like it too. This is pertinent because, by its own admission, Sony isn't doing very well at competing in the phone-making game. Given the above, is the Z3 going to tempt existing customers to upgrade? Or perhaps lure those over from other brands? T-Mobile will be stocking it this fall, though the price isn't yet known. Currently it's \u00a3550 in the UK -- a touch above the HTC One and Galaxy S5. Let's have a look, shall we? Gallery | 27 Photos Sony Xperia Z3 review + See all 27 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 88 Sony Xperia Z3 Pros Fantastic battery life High-quality finish Great camera Cons Software feels a little dated Summary For a phone that, initially at least, looks a lot like the one it's meant to replace the Z3 has a few tricks up its sleeve. Best of all is the standout battery life. Android photographers will love the camera too. It's easy to recommend the Z3, unless you're upgrading from the Z2, of course. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware As we hinted in the intro, the Xperia Z3 has a lot in common with the Xperia Z2. When we reviewed that phone back in April, we had plenty of good things to say about it. Mostly how far along the display had come. The good news is, that's one of the things the Z3 inherits -- a 5.2-inch full HD Triluminos panel with X-Reality (you can watch Sony explain what those marketing terms mean here). The silicon is remarkably familiar too. The Z3 boats a 2.5GHz quad-core processor, up from 2.3GHz in the Z2. But both are Snapdragon 801 chips (MSM8974AB in the Z2 vs. the Z3's MSM8974AC if you're keeping score). Both handsets have a 20.7-megapixel camera and run Android 4.4 KitKat. Then, of course, there's the design. Xperia phones in general aren't known for their bold and varied aesthetic, especially not the Z series. If you lined them up from the original Xperia Z through to the Z3, you'd mostly be picking at details to tell them apart. The original Xperia Z might cast more or less the same shadow as the Z3, but the newest flagship has a much more premium feel thanks to the matte-finish metal edges. The corners are actually nylon -- to make them less prone to dings should you drop it -- but you wouldn't notice unless you were looking closely. The buttons and ports are still hidden under sealable caps to help keep it waterproof, with micro-USB on the left side, and nano- (not micro-) SIM and a memory card slot on the right. There's still a dedicated camera button on this side too, which is always nice. Other internals remain the same this time: 3GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage. If you were a fan of the slightly generous top and bottom bezels that Sony seems so fond of, well, good news -- they're still here too. For all its familiarity, the Z3 is still its own phone. It's slightly trimmer by about one millimeter in each dimension, and at 152 grams, it's lighter than its 163-gram predecessor, making it less prone to butterfingers. It's also more waterproof than before and is now fully dust-resistant (rated to IP65/68, up from IP55/58), which means it can sit in 1.5 meters of water for a full half-hour. Finally, the camera has some new features (more on that later), and the display is brighter. All things considered, while Sony marketing is duty-bound to argue that this is the best Xperia Z ever, with reasonable improvements on many of the key specifications, we're willing to roll with it. Not all specs are up, though: Weirdly, the battery capacity is actually down from 3,200mAh to 3,100mAh. More on that later, though.

There will be some who wish for Sony to up its game in the spec wars, and join the 2K club. But it hasn't. It's resolutely stayed put at 1080p. Battery life might be one reason; it certainly seems to take a toll on the 2K-capable LG G3, which is lucky to make it through the day. Given how far the displays on the Xperia Z line have come since the original Z, it looks like Sony's taking the time to try and get things right before jacking up the pixel count. That is to say, the display on the Xperia Z3 is much nicer to look at than the original Z and Z1. Viewing angles are much improved; the color representation in my photo comparisons seems natural and more balanced than before. Also, as mentioned, at 660 nits, it's brighter than last time around, too (the Z2 topped out at 428 nits). Comparing photos and videos with source materials shows blacks to be deeper and darker than on the Z1 (harder to tell apart on the Z2), while colors are perhaps a little warmer. Still, it's nowhere near the levels you might find on a Samsung GS4 or GS5. So, if you were hoping Sony's experience with higher resolutions in the TV market meant its phones would be going 4K before everyone else, then you'll be disappointed. But you shouldn't be -- the company's apparently investing its efforts elsewhere. As a complete package, there's no doubt the Z3 is, in my opinion, the nicest Xperia phone I've ever laid my hands on. It's perhaps the improved finish on the sides, or the way the port covers neatly click in place, or the dense (yet not-too-heavy) feel, or the upgraded display, or the all-round good specs. Perhaps through a combination of the above, in a \"greater than the sum of its parts\" kinda way, Sony's finally made a phone that doesn't feel blocky and flat next to the likes of the HTC One M8 or the Nexus 5. Camera For the last two generations of Sony flagships, there's been a 20.7-megapixel camera. That's still the case here. And frankly, we're not surprised the megapixel count hasn't gone up again. There are plenty of other ways to improve a camera other than bumping up the number of pixels. Sony's addressed a few of them here. The biggest change on a hardware level is the wider 25mm lens. This means you get a little more in the shot with each photo (see below for an example). Most of the other significant changes are software based. Sony already bundled a lot of custom features with its camera (such as Info-eye, and Picture effect modes), and now there's more. Namely \"Multi-camera\" (which combines the shots of two Z3s) and a new \"AR fun\" mode. The merits of many of these features are open for debate. Some, like \"Live on YouTube\" or \"Background defocus,\" can be genuinely useful. But others, like AR fun (which lets you draw your own augmented reality critters on screen)? Not so much. Fun to use once; probably never to be used again. Should all of these modes not be enough for you, there are a bunch of others you can download to further augment your camera's functionality. These range from the productive (Evernote, PDF scanner) to the obscure (one claims to turn your camera into a global air-traffic radar!). I tinkered with a number of these modes, but found myself defaulting back to either full auto or manual, depending on what I wanted to shoot. I do still like the idea of being able to stream live to YouTube through my phone; I just need to find a reason to do so. Gallery | 38 Photos Sony Xperia Z3 sample shots + See all 38 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") For all these features and modes, though, I find myself echoing the sentiments of our Z2 review. With the core camera functionality being so good (the 1/2.3-inch sensor sucks up light, and the image quality is high), it's easily one of the best cameras in a phone right now. It isn't quite up to Nokia Lumia 1020 standards, but it definitely beats Samsung's GS5 and holds its own against the iPhone 6 from what I've seen. Low-light performance is good. There's still evidence of noise in particularly dim conditions. I took some night shots around London's River Thames, and without particularly trying to keep a steady hand, lines weren't overly blurred as is often the case with longer-exposure photos. The question is, why throw in all these party tricks? If the camera's UI were more focused on manual exposure settings (still with an auto mode, of course), there'd be a good case for this being the Android-using street photographer's go-to phone. Instead, it almost feels like Sony is scared it might lose some mainstream appeal. The result is a very good camera that shoots 4K video, does good time-lapses and more -- that then gets demoted to producing augmented reality dinosaurs. Software Sony's user interface is like a pair of comfortable shoes. They're not your favorite, but they're dependable, don't have any surprises and they look snazzy... or they did a few years ago, anyway. There's nothing egregious about the Xperia software experience, but you definitely need to wear it in. Mostly this involves deleting all the well-meaning widgets (mostly for Sony's streaming services), and reverting it to something you're more familiar with. Once you do de-brand it a little, it's a fairly inoffensive take on Android KitKat. Sony does throw in a few handy custom features, like shortcuts on the multitasking screen, and the Lifelog app. I was quite fond of the app when I reviewed Sony's SmartBand, though the phone can also log steps without the help of a wristband. Sony is also doing its bit to keep up with the Joneses (i.e., HTC) with a new feature that collates images and videos you shoot over a day (or days, even) and makes you a Zoe-esque highlight video. You can turn it off of course, but after a busy day out with friends, getting a little video recap was a nice surprise. Gallery | 14 Photos Sony Xperia Z3 screenshots + See all 14 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") One software feature I really do like is one that you could miss completely if you weren't looking for it. Long-press the power button on the side and you'll see an option for screen recording on the menu where you normally choose to power down or go into airplane mode. Now you can record what you're doing with your phone, and share that video with people. This is great for a number of use cases. Tutorials, obviously, but also recording games, demonstrating phone or website bugs, creating cutaway video clips for phone reviews (like this one) and, of course, keeping a permanent record of SnapChats (we know that's what you were all thinking). Android KitKat sorta, kinda has screen recording by default, but it's such a pickle to get it working that it's mostly not worth the bother. Likewise, if you've ever trawled the Play store for screen recorders, you'll know it's a bit of a minefield. Sony's taken care of all that by baking one in. Nice work. Performance and battery life This section can be explained in one sentence: The Xperia Z3 performs well and has epic battery life. There. Done. Really, you don't need to know more. But if you do... I'd add that the battery life is the reason why this phone will be remembered. In my personal usage, I regularly got two days of full use, or so near to two days that I'm loath to mark it down for the odd 10PM finish on the second day. This is with pretty constant \"Engadget editor\" sort of use too. It feels weird -- unnatural almost. Like, I knew I didn't have to charge it every night, and that felt moderately exhilarating. Reckless and liberating. OK, maybe I'm getting carried away, but it really is head and shoulders above any other flagship in the last few years. In our more official video-looping test (with WiFi and data on, and brightness at 50 percent), it racked up a solid 12 hours and 13 minutes. This is actually about the same time as the Z2 and Z1, but the savings in real use apparently come from how Sony updates the screen (or not -- it saves energy by only refreshing the display when needed). Hence, why constantly playing video might break the magic spell. Our benchmark tests are a little less exciting. The Z3 delivers generally good performance across the board. With nearly the same silicon as the last-gen model, it unsurprisingly comes quite close on most metrics. Real-world usage is equally inconspicuous. That's to say, there's never really any moment, even right out of the box, when I find myself thinking \"Wow, this is so next-level fast!\" But equally, it never left me wanting. Not once did I notice any apps hanging, nor did any of the games I played struggle to keep up. Like I said at the beginning of this section: The Xperia Z3 performs well, and has epic battery life. That leaves data and calls. Using London's O2 network, I was regularly able to pull down between 20 and 50 Mbps, depending on the time of day and location. This is about as fast as you can expect in the big smoke, so no complaints there. Calls are loud and clear, but to be fair, it's been a long time (when signal is good) that that hasn't been the case with every phone. The competition Right now, the most obvious rivals for the Xperia Z3 are the Moto X, Samsung Galaxy S5, the LG G3, the HTC One (M8) and, possibly the soon-to-be-refreshed Nexus 5. All of these are strong Android phones in their own right. Each has its own stand out feature, like Moto's software tricks, Samsung's heart-rate monitor, LG's QHD display and HTC's quirky Duo Camera. The Z3 has none of these things. But, that might be exactly why you want it. None of the fuss, just a flagship phone. Potentially, the biggest competition might actually come from Sony's own lineup, in the form of the Z3 Compact. The two phones are almost identical save for their size (5.2 vs. 4.6 inches). That said, the Z3 Compact does have a smaller battery, so if endurance is the thing that's interested you most about the phone so far, you'll need to weigh the pros and cons of screen size over battery life. Wrap-up I'll be honest and say that while I know intellectually that the Z1 and Z2 were good phones, they weren't my cup of tea. But there's something about the Z3 that makes it the first Xperia phone I'd be happy to own. As of this writing, my daily driver is an LG G3. That's a phone I've become very fond of. I thought for the period of time I was reviewing the Xperia Z3 that I'd find myself cheating on it with the G3. But I didn't. The hardware, for the first time, looks and feels as sharp as some of the other well-dressed competition (the M8s and Samsung Galaxy Alphas of the world). That might sound shallow, but when you're paying flagship prices, you want that flagship feel. The Z3 has it in spades. If you owned the Z2, or even the Z1, there might not quite be enough new here to bother upgrading -- unless, of course, you're just due a new phone anyway, and you like what Sony is putting down with the Z series. But, if you're currently in the market for a top-flight Android handset and are particularly interested in good battery life, this might be your best bet. Even if battery life isn't a priority, the Z3 is still worthy of your attention -- even if it's just because it's the dictionary definition of an all-rounder. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android, mobilepostcross, review, sony, uk-reviews, video, xperia, z3 \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20970661 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20970661\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); lab.scriptBs('gravity.js') onBreak({ 0: function(){}, 320: function(){}, 768: function(){} }); ", "title": "Sony Xperia Z3 review: a classy flagship with great battery life"},

That, coupled with the news that Samsung was going to focus on a smaller number of devices in 2015, signaled a pretty dramatic change for a brand that seemed like it was unstoppable. As if to silence the doubters, Samsung has not one, but two flagships on offer -- the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge -- and they're surrounded by questions. Can they restore Samsung to its former glory? Has the company figured out how to build a truly interesting smartphone again? It's too early to make a call on the former, but after a week of testing, the answer to the latter is a clear and definite \"yes.\" Gallery | 73 Photos Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge review + See all 73 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 89 Samsung Galaxy S6 Pros Sturdy, stylish design Impeccable camera experience Great day-to-day performance TouchWiz is finally\u00a0worth using Cons Battery life could be better Fingerprint sensor can be flaky It's not waterproof No microSD or removable battery Summary Samsung has a lot riding on its 2015 flagship, and this time it's put its best foot forward.\u00a0With its super-fast, homebrew processor, a pair of great cameras and a surprisingly clean version of TouchWiz, the\u00a0S6 is the finest Galaxy\u00a0Samsung has ever made.

It performs just as well as its cousin in every task we threw at it, but the few software gimmicks that make use of the Edge's beautiful curved display just don't do much to justify the extra cost. Buy it for its looks, not because it's any more functional. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Before we go any further, know this: Aside from the obvious differences -- the Edge has a wrap-around screen and a few software tricks that take advantage of it -- the Galaxy S6 and the S6 Edge are basically identical. Same screen size, same 16-megapixel cameras, same octa-core Exynos 7420 brains, and so on. They're two devices crafted with the same metal, glass and silicon, which makes the dramatic design differences between them all the more meaningful. Looking at it dead on, though, the S6 is pretty plain. Your eyes will immediately get sucked into the 5.1-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED screen, but a 5-megapixel selfie camera sits above it while the Home button lies below, flanked by discrete Back and Recent Apps keys. High on the S6's back is a squarish plateau that houses the 16-megapixel camera, and to the right lies a tiny black divot where the LED flash and heart rate sensor live. Unlike the crater that marked the Galaxy S5's back, the assembly here is almost flush with the S6's rear. It's a small touch, but it makes taking heart rate and blood oxygen readings in S Health quite a bit easier. Really, it's details like these that speak most loudly to Samsung's new design philosophy. Let's put aside for a moment the fact that Samsung traded its trademark plastic bodies for sturdy metal frames and Gorilla Glass 4 panels lining the S6's front and back. What's more important -- and consequently harder to express in words -- are the little touches that tie everything together. The S6's rounded sides are punctuated by a flat edge for your fingers to rest on. The gaps between the metal and Gorilla Glass are so fine as to be imperceptible. The sole speaker has been moved to the phone's bottom so you're not blasting tunes straight into your desk. I could go on, but the S6 just feels seamless in a way its predecessor never did. And no, your eyes don't deceive you: The Galaxy S6 looks (and feels) an awful lot like an iPhone. From those rounded sides to the chrome-rimmed, fingerprint-sensing Home button to placement of the volume buttons on the left edge and the power button on the right, there's an odd air of familiarity surrounding the thing. (A brief aside: One of Samsung's spokespeople picked up my iPhone 6 during our hands-on time in February and it seemed to take him a few moments to realize what he was actually holding.) Flame wars on the matter are already starting to brew, but I'm not too concerned; Samsung's end result is lovely, and that's all most people will care about. Alas, though, streamlining the S6's design meant taking an axe to some of the things that endeared the Galaxy line to persnickety nerds -- namely, the removable battery and microSD card slot. My T-Mobile review unit came with 32GB of internal storage ($0 down with monthly payments on T-Mo, or $199 with a contract elsewhere), but you'll soon be able to buy 64GB and 128GB models too. And the biggest heartbreak? The S6 breaks tradition by dying when you drop it in a pool. The news will be more tragic for some than others but not having to handle the S5 with kid gloves was a treat. Hopefully Samsung figures out a way to waterproof a design like this before next year rolls around. Now, about the Edge ($299 with a contract). It's equal parts gorgeous and gimmicky, but if money is no object, the former definitely outweighs the latter. Unlike the G Flex2, the Edge's curved screen falls away from you at the sides instead of angling toward you from the top and bottom. The design does nothing to make the screen more immersive, but that doesn't matter; the screen's novelty and beauty still mean it's hard to tear your eyes off it. The S6 Edge feels substantially thinner than its basic cousin because of how its sides taper to a super-slim edge. This trick is a familiar one -- Motorola has done it with every Moto X to date -- but it keeps getting recycled for a reason. The thing is, the Edge will probably never nestle comfortably into your hands as a result; if your fingers are like mine, they'll forever arch over its back, which can sometimes feel a little precarious. In fact, at times I wished the curve were on the opposite side just so the rest of my hand had something to hang onto. On the plus side, that extra space along the Edge's sides gives you room to swipe up, down, left and right without your thumb ever obscuring the action. Really, though, these navigational benefits feel like an afterthought, like happy little accidents that came about thanks to Samsung's screen-shape decision. Make no mistake: The Edge's main job is to look good. Display and sound If you wanted to skip this section outright, just know this before you go: The S6 and the S6 Edge have absolutely gorgeous screens. They're both Quad HD panels (2,560 x 1,440, if you haven't memorized it yet) akin to the one you'll find in the Note 4, but they only measure at 5.1 inches diagonally. Yep, you guessed it: That means we're looking at two of the most pixel-dense screens on the market today. As far as your eyes will be able to tell, individual pixels don't even exist. Whether or not modern smartphone screens actually need to be this insanely crisp is a question that's up for debate, but my stance is pretty simple: As long as battery life doesn't tank as a result, bring 'em on. As is usually the case with Samsung's AMOLEDs, colors are incredibly vivid, while blacks are deep and sumptuous. A quick bit of screen nerdery for you: AMOLED panels typically skew a little more toward the blue end of the spectrum than LCDs do, which means it's actually a pleasant surprise that whites appear more neutral here than they do on the new HTC One M9. Some of this is going to be subjective, of course. I'll admit I like my screens a little punchy, and the S6's color settings suited me just fine out of the box. If that's not your taste, you can pop into the settings and swap screen modes to something more appropriate: the \"AMOLED cinema\" setting pumps up color saturation across the board, while \"AMOLED photo\" dials it down a bit from the default \"Adaptive\" setting. Then you've got the \"Basic\" setting, which just sucks the life out of everything. It's arguably the most accurate mode of the four, but really, where's the fun in that? Viewing angles on the S6 are great too -- a lucky break for the poor soul whose in-flight entertainment system crapped out and has to watch your episodes of The Fall from the side. So far I've been treating both screens as if they were the same, but that's clearly not true. The Note Edge wanted to cram gobs of functionality into that spillover area. The G Flex and G Flex2 sought to draw you into media with a curved screen reminiscent of high-end TVs. The S6 Edge does none of those things. It just sort of... is. I'll break down more what the screen's edges actually can do down in the software section, but Samsung's overriding concern here was making a screen that looks awesome, and on that front, it succeeded. At its most severe, the Edge's screen curves away from you at about 35 degrees, as if the sides are retreating into your palms. Let's put our nitpicker hats on for a second -- that means that from some oblique angles, the stuff that flows into those subtle curves will appear much brighter than it does on the flat part of the screen. It's the mildest of annoyances (I don't remember ever being bothered by it), but it'll definitely stand out at first. So yes, the S6 and the S6 Edge look lovely. How do they sound? Both devices share the same single speaker nestled into the bottom-right corners of their frames, and it's dramatically louder than the clunker we got in last year's Galaxy S5. There's no way it'll ever hold a candle to the One M9 and its pair of BoomSound speakers, but the S6 duo's driver brings enough oomph to the table that you can stick the phone into your car's cupholder, crank up the volume and still hear plenty over the din of the road. Software Like every other phone maker worth its salt, Samsung has spent the past year or two slowly cranking down on the sheer amount of stuff it slops on top of stock Android. It really shows, too: The version of TouchWiz that ships on the S6 and the S6 Edge is about as restrained as I've seen on a Samsung phone yet. Turns out, chopping out extraneous menu options and visual cruft was high up on the company's list of priorities this year, so don't ever let anyone tell you that complaining ad nauseam can't get huge conglomerates to rethink their plans. Anyway, all of Samsung's greatest hits are still here, and they're paired with a flatter, cleaner, Material Design-y look that jibes nicely with Android 5.0.2. Seriously, it's terribly refreshing if you're coming from a Galaxy S5. Swiping to the left once again reveals your Flipboard Briefing, a BlinkFeed-like stream of news stories culled from news sources around the web. It might not pull choice updates from your Twitter or Instagram accounts like on an HTC phone, but it does look a hell of a lot handsomer. The app launcher itself is a little less attractive, at least at first. By default, Samsung has arranged all of its apps (including Microsoft pack-ins like OneNote and OneDrive) and everything else you install gets tacked on the end of the list in the order you downloaded it. Thankfully, there's an \"A-Z\" button in the corner to whip things into more manageable shape. Oh, and you can resize the app grid on your home screen to accommodate up to 20 shortcuts, not including widgets. Gallery | 49 Photos Samsung's newer, lighter TouchWiz + See all 49 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Now, I was plenty (and surprisingly) fond of TouchWiz's style the moment I fired up these phones, but you can choose from about 12 different themes if you're itching for something else. Right now Samsung's Theme Store leans heavily toward the cutesy side with themes that feature super-simple, hand-drawn icon sets and artwork; the only deviation from the norm is a tie-in theme for The Avengers: Age of Ultron. Nothing like the smell of brand synergy, right? Anyway, moving on. A quick tap on the Recent Apps button brings up the usual deck of app cards, but you'll notice a Multi Window icon on some of them -- tapping that'll resize the app to take up half the screen, leaving enough room to either see the app running beneath it or resize another one to fill the other half completely. Works like a charm when you need it (I'll admit to simultaneously browsing Facebook and Instagram in my weakest moments), and it's so much less of a headache to activate now. Props, Samsung. Oh, and while we're talking about apps, no, you cannot uninstall whatever you want by pressing, holding and tapping a delete icon. Trying it on an app you've downloaded works fine. Try it on a preloaded app (say, S Health) and you'll instead get a prompt to disable it; that is, you can shut it off, but you can't remove it from the phone. What about stuff you don't want to delete, but don't want anyone else seeing? Private mode is still around and ready to keep your media and files out of the wrong hands. What's more, the fingerprint sensor baked into the Home button is both better (just press your finger into it, no swipe required) and easier to set up. S Health has gotten some improvements too, although most of them are in appearance only; health data like your steps taken and heart rate recordings appear in a grid that reminds me an awful lot of Withings' health app. It's easy to add or remove categories from the grid, and all the usual tricks, like measuring the amount of oxygen in your blood, are present and accounted for. Curiously, the UV-sensing feature that we spotted on the Note 4's version of the app is gone here, but hey, I hardly ever used it other than to prove to others I could. Also missing is perhaps the most interesting trick Samsung has up its sleeve: Samsung Pay. Both the S6 and S6 Edge can technically transmit payments with the traditional mag-stripe readers found in most retail stores, but those chops will go untested until the app that ties everything together launches later this year. Using the Edge This is where you might expect the Edge to shine. After all, the test balloon that was the Note Edge used that extra space extensively, right? Well, not exactly. I'd argue the big Edge tried to shoehorn as many little gimmicks as it could into that little side-screen (does anyone really need a ruler on their phones?), and it seems like Samsung over-corrected here. A brief aside: None of the little applets created with the Note Edge's SDK are usable here, so don't even bother. Swiping in from the upper left or right part of the screen (you'll indicate during setup if you're a righty or lefty) causes an array of colored bubbles to drift into view. That's People Edge. You can assign up to five people their own specific color, so that when they contact you, the edge of the phone will spring to life with their assigned hue. It's a neat trick, for sure, but its value is limited. To start, why the limit on five people and colors? And if the edge that lights up happens to be pointing away from you, you might as well just flip the phone over and see who it is instead of turning it around to see what color is throbbing. Meanwhile, rubbing the edge of the screen while it's off causes Samsung's so-called Information Stream to pop up, giving you access to the time, notifications and news updates without lighting up the whole panel. Truly, it's so much more convenient to tap the Home button to see all that than to stroke the edge of a screen; in fact, it's so much easier that to even bother just seems silly. It'd be another story if the news headline that showed up was somehow tied to your preferences as set in Flipboard Briefing, but nope -- it's just some random nothing from Yahoo News. Oh, and you can turn on a clock that'll live on the edge until the battery level drops below 15 percent. That's the only truly useful feature in the mix... except it only works for 12 hours at a time. What? The thing is, I appreciate that Samsung didn't try to bog the Edge down with nonsense, but in doing so, it proved it still doesn't know what to do with that extra space. That'd be a greater sin if the screen didn't look so damned cool, but none of this helps sell the Edge to anyone who's on the fence. Camera The cameras in Samsung's high-end phones have always been at least above average, but that's not good enough anymore. Nailing the camera was just crucial this time around and, long story short, Samsung did a great job. But first, the broad strokes. The S6 and the Edge share the same 16-megapixel rear camera (made by Sony, no less), which doesn't sound incredibly impressive compared to some of the other sensors used in other phones. Still, the combination of the sensor plus optical image stabilization and an f/1.9 lens is highly effective; nearly all the photos I've shot are appropriately colorful, crisp and finely detailed. Performance in low light is mostly great too, though you'll occasionally have to tap to focus a few times to make sure you're actually homing in on what you wanted. HDR mode can help tremendously here when photons are scarce, but it's best used when you're photographing dim landscapes or subjects that can sit still. The fact that we've got a beautiful Quad-HD AMOLED screen to view them on is a huge plus too (though your screen color settings might mean the actual photo looks different on your phone than on a computer or television). Meanwhile, the wide-angle lens on the 5-megapixel front-facing camera makes for some seriously spacious selfies -- it captures way more of your surroundings than you might expect, so bring the phone in close for the best results. Just be sure to dial down Beauty Mode to keep your face from looking like you got plastered with foundation. That's not to say the camera experience is perfect; the auto-exposure can be a little finicky sometimes, leading to some overly warm shots when things get dim. Gallery | 53 Photos Galaxy S6 + S6 Edge camera samples + See all 53 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") When it comes to the competition, the S6 and Edge produce photos that were better exposed and more vivid than the ones I shot using the HTC One M9. I don't mean for this to turn into a Samsung/Apple slapfest, but the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have always been my go-to mobile camera because they capture almost uniformly lovely shots with virtually no effort at all. That's always seemed like something Android devices have had trouble with and I'm happy to report the S6 and S6 Edge are -- finally -- definite exceptions to the rule. All the photos you'll see in the gallery above were shot with everything set to auto and with HDR off, and I've dumped them into this Flickr album in case you want to take a closer look. For the sake of speed, you can fire up the camera by swiping up on the home screen or by double-tapping the Home button at any time. Samsung says it only takes 0.7 second to jump into the camera proper, and while I haven't been sitting around with a stopwatch checking the claim, I've always been able to start snapping new shots in about one second. By default, the Samsung camera app is straightforward; the shutter button and mode selector live on one end, and a quick tap reveals controls for your flash, timer and HDR on the other. If you're anything like me, you'll be working with this default configuration most of the time and the results won't leave you complaining. You can, however, jump into a Pro mode where you can fiddle with your exposure, ISO and metering settings, and it's easy enough to save those changes as a preset to be fired up later. Pro mode aside, you've got your usual slew of kooky features to play with, but the new ones are worth pointing out. Kicking the camera into background defocus mode is a nifty little attraction that lets you selectively blur parts of your shots, sort of like a Lytro, but all in software. Thing is, you can often coax that sort of bokeh from the lens and camera without software trickery at all so long as you stick the phone close to your subject. There's a Virtual shot mode that captures a 3D video of an object if you can move around it smoothly enough too, and it's cool enough until you realize you can't share it and still maintain the flashy effect. The ability to record 4K video is back as well, and with the same five-minute limitation Samsung aficionados will already be familiar with. Most of the video I shot between the two devices was on par with the still photos I took, and a new object-tracking autofocus (a feature I'm used to seeing more in DSLRs) usually works like a charm too. At the end of the day, I'd still give the photographic edge to the iPhones, but it's an awfully tight race and Android fans can buy an S6 or S6 Edge without fear of working at a disadvantage. Performance and battery life With each passing year we demand more and more from our tiny pocket-computers, especially when they're hyped up the way flagships are. The hype was especially boisterous this year: A crush of reports maintained that Samsung was originally on the Snapdragon train, before it ditched the 810 in favor of silicon of its own making. The end result: Top-tier devices from HTC and LG stuck with the 810 while the S6 and the S6 Edge sport a homebrew octa-core Exynos 7420 chipset, which pairs a quartet of 2.1GHz processor cores with another quartet of 1.5GHz cores and 3GB of RAM. When it comes to regular, day-to-day performance, the differences are slight. That's to be expected, really; we're inching toward an age so profuse with processing power, so rife with RAM that flicking through home screens and firing up apps on flagship phones is nearly seamless. Both the S6 and the Edge were incredibly snappy, with virtually zero lag during normal use. I could usually coax the phones to take a little longer than normal to figure out what to do next, but the keyword there is \"coax\" -- we're talking opening apps and leaping between them faster than anyone would ever need to just to be an ass. Whenever I used the phone as I normally would, both devices were basically butter. Speaking of butter, it wouldn't surprise me if devices running the Snapdragon 810 occasionally ran warm enough to melt some. That was supposedly the reason Samsung ditched the chipset altogether, and if true, the folks in Korea made the right call. Graphics- and processor-intensive tasks usually push smartphones to their limits, so I spent about 45 minutes sifting through the auto-firing tedium that is Dead Trigger 2. The S6 and Edge scarcely warmed up at all. Ditto for the hours I spent drifting around Asphalt 8 with the visual quality cranked all the way up. The phones got a touch warmer while I was running some benchmark tests, but the heat buildup was nowhere near as noticeable as it was on the M9. Samsung Galaxy S6/Edge HTC One M9 Samsung Galaxy Note Edge iPhone 6 Plus AndEBench Pro 10,552 7,404 8,886 N/A Vellamo 3.0 3,677 2,874 1,882 N/A 3DMark IS Unlimited 21,632 21,409 19,912 17,902 SunSpider 1.0.2 (ms) 674 706 788 388 GFXBench 3.0 1080p Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 25 22 18.4 18.2 CF-Bench 62,257 53,579 40,143 N/A SunSpider 1.0.2: Android devices tested in Chrome; lower scores are better. That the S6 and Edge would be super-snappy was sort of a given, but the bigger question is how long they'll last before they need a trip to the power outlet. Before we tackle that, it's worth noting that the two S6s aren't identical in this regard: The basic S6 has a 2,550mAh battery while the Edge has a slightly bigger 2,600mAh one. Oh, and don't forget that both batteries are sealed too; the age of swapping spare cells into your new Galaxy S is finally over, I'm afraid. Samsung says its new line of 14nm Exynos processors are designed to deliver more horsepower at greater efficiency, which leads to both versions of the phone sticking around for between 11 and 12 hours of continuous workday use (which in my case consists of horsing around on social networks, firing off emails in CloudMagic, taking a smattering of calls and the occasional prolonged bathroom break playing games). That's not shabby, but it does lag slightly behind the 13 hours I regularly squeezed out of the One M9 and my old Galaxy S5. Neither device really dazzled in our standard Engadget rundown test, either. With a 720p video set to loop with the cellular and WiFi radios on and the screen brightness set to 50 percent, the S6 only lasted eight hours and 49 minutes. Meanwhile, the Edge and its very slightly bigger battery hung in there for nine hours and two minutes before finally giving up the ghost. In case you're wondering, both died about an hour before last year's Galaxy S5 did, although they beat out the HTC One M9 by about 40 minutes. Thankfully, all of this is offset a bit by the fact that both devices recharge quickly; think: bone-dry to 50 percent in 30 minutes. The competition This is shaping up to be an awesome time to buy a smartphone, as some of the biggest players have already revealed their flagships for the year. First up: the HTC One M9. It made its US debut at nearly the same time as the S6 and the S6 Edge, and with it comes a very familiar set of design genes, Qualcomm's shiny new Snapdragon 810 chipset and a mostly great set of speakers. If anything, its tragic flaw is the 20-megapixel camera sitting high on its back. During my weeks of testing, I couldn't reliably get photos that were better than what last year's M8 was capable of. Honestly, the average consumer probably won't be able to tell, but the issue is made doubly troubling by the fact that the S6 duo's cameras are among the best I've ever seen in a smartphone. If you're not one of the diehards that love HTC's design DNA, this could be a tough choice (especially since the most basic versions of both devices start at $199 with a contract). LG's G Flex2 ($199 on contract) also rocks a Snapdragon 810 chip, and is currently the fastest thing Samsung's Korean rival has on offer... for now. While the left and right of the S6 Edge's screen curve away from you, the Flex2's top and bottom curve toward you -- the idea is your media will suck you in when you turn the thing on its side. Does it work? Not as much as I'd like. Alas, LG's usually light touches with its Android overlays were just weighty enough to slow down day-to-day usage. Meanwhile, Samsung has dialed down TouchWiz's odiousness to the point where I prefer it over LG's interface anyway. And pardon me for getting a little meta, but the S6 Edge's biggest competitor is none other than the regular S6. Both phones are absolutely identical where it matters, and the Edge's subtly curving screen is pure gimmick; none of the Edge's software tricks come close to justifying a $100 price difference on contract. Unless you absolutely love (and I mean love) the curved look, you can safely buy an S6 and know that you're not missing out on anything of crucial importance. Then, of course, there's the iPhone. Say what you will about Samsung taking design cues from Cupertino -- if you're not sure whether to go iOS or Android, your decision just got a lot tougher. Apple's ecosystem usually gets buzzy new apps before Android does, and I'd say the cameras on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (more the latter, really) are just a hair better. Still, the combination of some top-notch hardware and a version of TouchWiz that's mostly a pleasure to use means I'm considering dropping my iPhone 6 in favor of an S6 Edge as my full-time daily driver. Now, if only my friends would all use something other than iMessage. Wrap-up I've never been a huge fan of Samsung phones. For years, the software felt too kludgy, the designs chintzy and scattershot. Not so this time. Samsung has in the S6 a flagship that feels well thought-out and complete in a way I wasn't sure the company was capable of anymore. Calling it \"perfect\" would be irresponsible and inaccurate, but the S6 is the closest Samsung has come in a long time. Then there's the Edge. If it hasn't become abundantly clear already, let me belabor the point one last time: There is no functional benefit to owning this thing. It does everything the regular S6 does, and what few edge-friendly tricks it packs aren't even all that useful. The only real reason to buy it is because you like the way it looks -- and I do. I really, really do. Together, they're the brightest stars in Samsung's galaxy, and the S6 in particular will rightfully wind up in a lot of people's pockets. If you've got cash to burn, though, or if you're a real sucker for the new and beautiful, the S6 Edge might just be what you've been searching for. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android, galaxy, galaxys6, galaxys6edge, mobile, mobilepostcross, review, s6, s6edge, samsung, samsunggalaxy, smartphone, touchwiz, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21157197 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21157197\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s6/\"> Samsung Galaxy S6 </a> Samsung Galaxy S6 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s6/\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy S6 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 6 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android (Lollipop [5.0]) Screen size 5.1 inches Internal memory 32 GB Camera Yes Released 2015-04-10 see all specs \u2192 9.5average user rating Reception and call quality 9.3 Display 10 Battery life 7.7 Camera 10 Ease of use 9.7 Design and form factor 10 Portability (size / weight) 9.7 Media support 10 Durability 8.7 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 9.7 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 5 Nexus 6 vs iphone 6 plus vs s6 5 iPhone 6 Plus vs Samsung Galaxy S6 5 Transfer data from iPhone 6 to Galaxy S6?

It's all about building devices to show off the bleeding-edge version of Android, to give us a better sense of Google's vision of our collective mobile future. That future isn't just phones, either: It's about screens of all sizes, and that's why Google and HTC teamed up to build the new Nexus 9. Now that ancestors like the Nexus 7 and 10 have been forcibly shuffled off this mortal coil, the 9 stands alone as the sole tablet in Google's Nexus hardware lineup. So, does it live up to the standard geeks expect from the Nexus name? And more importantly, is it actually worth the asking price? Gallery | 41 Photos Nexus 9 review + See all 41 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 85 HTC Nexus 9 Pros Android 5.0 Lollipop runs like a dream Material Design face-lift is warm, welcoming K1 chipset is plenty powerful, despite benchmark oddities Cons Screen is solid, not jaw-dropping BoomSound speakers not as good as M8's No expandable memory Summary The Nexus 9 is the first tablet to run Google's Android 5.0 Lollipop, and it shines because of it. Its design might not be worth writing home about and the speakers up front leave a bit to be desired, but the combination of Lollipop and NVIDIA's powerful K1 chipset make it a serious contender (and a no-brainer if you're into fast and frequent software updates). _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Forget rewriting the rule book: When it comes to design, Google and HTC wanted to keep the Nexus 9 looking as subtle -- and as familiar -- as possible. Don't believe me? A quick look at its backside should prove my point. Putting that sturdy aluminum frame aside, you'd think someone threw a shrink ray in reverse and aimed it at last year's Nexus 5. That broad, gently curving expanse of matte black plastic is punctuated by a big Nexus logo in the center, while a familiar-looking 8-megapixel camera and LED flash sit prominently in the top-left corner. Those telltale angled edges are back too, housing the power button and volume rocker and sloping to meet the Nexus 9's understated face. A pair of hefty horizontal bezels frames the top and bottom of that 8.9-inch display (they're thankfully not as heinous as the ones on the Nexus 7), which happens to be where HTC's pair of BoomSound speakers live. Throw in a 1.6-megapixel camera just north of the screen and you've got the Nexus 9's appearance in a nutshell. There's a certain thrill in seeing how hardware design shifts year after year, but neither HTC nor Google was trying to break new ground this time around. And that was entirely by design, of course. After all, the star of the show is Android 5.0 Lollipop (much more on that later), and the design buffs working on the 9 were seemingly more than happy to let the tablet's looks fade into the background. If anything, it's what's inside that makes the biggest difference. The quad-core Qualcomm silicon that powered the 2013 Nexus 7 has been dumped in favor of NVIDIA's new 64-bit, dual-core Tegra K1 chipset with 2GB of RAM. That step back to a 2.3GHz dual-core processor might sound like a downgrade at first blush, but you can rest easy knowing that's not the case (especially when it comes to graphics performance, but more on that in a moment). The Nexus 9 I tested is a little pricier than the most basic version because it comes loaded with 32GB of internal storage -- no expandable memory here -- though it doesn't have a 3G/LTE radio like the top-tier model. Let's put those technicalities aside for a bit, though. How does this thing feel? If I'm honest, a 9-inch tablet (especially one that weighs in at 15 ounces) can feel awkward to use at times, even though the package itself is undeniably sturdy and well-constructed. That probably sounds a little odd considering it's just about the same thickness as a Retina display iPad mini, but we've got the Nexus 9's weightier plastic-and-aluminum hybrid build to thank for that. Even though it only tips the scales at 15 ounces (0.94 pound), it's still noticeably heavier in my hands than the 8.4-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab S and Amazon's Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. In fact, it's just a teensy bit lighter than the new iPad Air 2, despite Apple's tablet having a thinner frame, plus a bigger screen and battery. Yes, yes, it's been made clear that the Nexus 9 isn't meant to be an iPad killer, but I still can't help but wish Google and HTC pushed the envelope a bit more here. Your mileage might vary, but over the days I've been testing it, the 9 feels just a little too dense, too large to grasp with a single hand for long periods of time, while full-on two-hand typing on that screen can be a little precarious. HTC's put together a little something just for that scenario -- a surprisingly handsome physical keyboard case -- but I didn't have the chance to try one out. Long story short: The Nexus 9 lives in the upper strata of the no-man's-land between more popular 7- and 10-inch tablets, and it would've been nice to see Google and HTC pay a little more attention to the minute details that make big tablets feel handier. Display and sound Don't take this the wrong way, but after five days of testing the Nexus 9, I stopped paying the screen any mind. Sounds weird, I know, but it's not because it's lacking. The Nexus 9's namesake 9-inch display, with its bright colors and respectable viewing angles, is more pleasant than it is jaw-dropping. Consider it another example of HTC and Google not worrying about pushing an envelope. Alright, let's dig into things a little further. This time around, HTC went with a screen that runs at 2,048 x 1,536, which means it squeezes 281 pixels into each linear inch. In case you're keeping tabs, that isn't quite as densely crisp as the panels in Samsung's 8.4-inch Galaxy Tab S (359 ppi) or the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 (339 ppi), but you're still not going to pick out individual pixels without a magnifying glass and a persnickety personality. By nature, the Nexus 9's IPS LCD also isn't as sumptuous (or as easy on the battery) as the typically gorgeous AMOLED screens that grace some of its competitors, but that's no dealbreaker. All told, the Nexus 9's LCD is really a good screen, just not an outstanding one. Google sure knows it, too -- the search giant carefully avoids crowing about the display quality on the Nexus 9's product page, noting only that its size makes it both portable and immersive. You won't hear any arguments against that logic. I've loved HTC's BoomSound speakers since they first graced the One M7, so it's no surprise that I had high hopes for the Nexus 9. Alas, thanks to the lack of HTC's audio-enhancing software and the seemingly smaller drivers moving that air around, these speakers don't live up to the bar set by the ones on the One M8. Tight, energetic rock? Mellow jazz, laden with husky vocals? Soaring orchestral suites? I tried them all, and the results were the same each time: They all sounded more subdued and muddled than I'd hoped. Now, lest you think I'm being harsh, the speakers aren't bad by any stretch. They get plenty loud (though not as loud as the M8) and still have enough nuance to draw you into whatever video you happen to be watching. It's just that the crisp channel separation you'd get out of the M8's BoomSound speakers is missing here, and so is the bright, vibrant sound that's been a hallmark of HTC's high-end phones. Bummer. Software Gallery | 24 Photos Nexus 9 Lollipop screenshots + See all 24 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\")Now we're getting to the good stuff. Like all Nexus devices, the 9 isn't just meant to be a solid tablet. No, no: It's meant to be the standard-bearer of Google's Android tablet vision, a device that highlights the best that Android is capable of. That's basically just a long-winded way of me saying the Nexus 9 comes loaded with a shiny new build of Android 5.0 Lollipop. We've got a full initial preview for you right here, but read on for my distinctly tablet-y impressions. Still with me? Good. Brevity is apparently the soul of wit, so I can sum up what it's like to use Lollipop in just a few words: It's stunningly smooth. Part of that's because of the NVIDIA chipset thrumming away inside the 9's metal-and-plastic frame, but really, the Android team deserves a lot of credit for crafting an experience that feels damned near seamless. You'll probably notice that bump in speed and responsiveness most when you're swiping through multiple home screens and sifting through all your open apps; the latter feels outrageously quick, without a hint of lag on my test unit. Even better, app previews show up nearly instantaneously once the simulated inertia starts to slow down those app cards in motion. Speaking of apps, they launch quickly and run with fewer hiccups than on other similarly specced devices, though those rocket starts tend to slow down a touch when you've got loads of apps going at the same time. C'est la vie. We've got Google's newish Android Runtime (better known as ART) to thank for that. With Android 5.0, Google's team officially ditched its old-school Dalvik runtime in favor of ART, which it promised would offer some noticeable app performance gains. Why? It's because certain key bits of code are converted into native machine code the device can interpret when the app is installed, instead of every time the app is launched. You probably didn't need to know that, but hey -- it's what we're here for. In the end, just about every interaction I had with the Nexus 9 felt snappier than I expected, especially since I avoided the Android L Developer Preview. (What can I say? I like surprises.) Nicely done, Mountain View. And there are the unsung heroes, the features that make Lollipop just that much more pleasurable to use. A quick double-tap on the screen will rouse the 9 from its slumber, for instance -- no more fumbling for that hard-to-reach power button when the tablet's resting on your desk. Priority notifications, which can be toggled from the notification shade, ensure that you can get your productivity on without the risk of getting distracted by the din of Facebook updates and chirping Hangouts messages. The ability to add new users and restricted profiles is back too (you can have up to eight total), but it's also joined by the option to \"pin\" certain apps into place so unwitting guests can't pop out of them and root through your stuff. With a little bit of coaxing (by which I mean a quick jaunt into the separate Google Settings app), you can teach your Nexus 9 to listen for that trademark \"OK Google\" command even when the screen is off, too. The reality isn't quite as good as the promise, though: While Google Now can pick up questions and commands issued in hushed tones, I had to raise my voice a few decibels each time I wanted to wake up the tablet with a question. Of course, not all of Lollipop's big changes take place behind the scenes: Android as we know it has gotten a hefty face-lift thanks to Matias Duarte and the rest of Google's mobile design team. Just about every trace of the cold, digital Holo aesthetic has been excised, replaced by something vibrant, warmer and a little more physical. It's Material Design, and it's here to stay. In its simplest form, the story of Material Design is one centered on a new approach to colors, layers and motion. The first bit is easy enough to explain. Material Design plays host to lots of vivid colors, from the red and deep salmon of the excellent new dual-paned Gmail app (a tablet exclusive) to the greenish teal and light blue that give the stock Calculator app a new dose of personality. Meanwhile, some of Google's stock apps aren't flat any more. Elements are layered like sheets of paper stacked atop each other, with subtle drop shadows to keep everything distinct. And that focus on motion? It's meant to help keep things feeling consistently physical. Remember the inertia I mentioned when it came time to swiping through app cards? That's part of it. So is the app launcher button's explosion and expansion into the app tray itself -- Google wants us to feel like the bits and bobs that spring to life on the Nexus 9's screen stem directly from where we touch. Here's the big thing to remember, though: Duarte says that Material Design is going to be a focal point of sorts for all of Google's properties going forward. Web apps? Chrome OS? It'll all get the same kind of visual revamp down the road, though I'd advise against holding your breath until all that happens. These things take time. Camera Let's face it: Tablet cameras are rarely ever anything to write home about, and the pair of shooters shoehorned into the Nexus 9 don't do anything to buck that trend. The pair in question consists of an 8-megapixel main camera around back and the selfie-friendly 1.6-megapixel front-facer located right above the screen. There's still a weird stigma attached to using a tablet camera for on-the-go photography, but if you do that, expect the results out of that rear camera to be mostly crisp and well-saturated. As always, quality starts to take a dive when the photons start getting scarce, and it isn't long before you start seeing grain infiltrating your photos. Meanwhile, the front camera (low-resolution as it is) yields photos that are mostly smudgy and unsatisfying. It'll do in a pinch for a video Hangout, but you'd best turn to your phone when it comes time to snap a selfie or six. Video quality lies in the middle of the road too: The Nexus 9 can shoot 1080p footage and it's usually quite nice until the ambient sound levels pick up and you're left with some messy audio. Gallery | 4 Photos Nexus 9 camera samples + See all 4 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") All of the above is driven by Google' stock Camera app, and guess what: It's about as straightforward an experience as you'll find. Wanna snap a photo? Nudge that gigantic, rectangular shutter button. Swiping from left to right lets you jump among shooting standard photos, Photo Spheres (remember those?), panoramas and videos. A deeper dive into the settings lets you decide whether you want location data to be saved with each shot, and if you want manual exposure controls for even more granular shot-taking. Feel free to leave that particular option unchecked though; most of my best shots came about through careless pointing and shooting. Performance Google Nexus 9 Samsung Galaxy Tab S** NVIDIA Shield tablet iPad Air 2 Quadrant 2.0 13,737 18,597 20,556 N/A Vellamo 2.0 2,653 1,672 3,055 N/A SunSpider 1.0.2* (ms) 948.3 1,109 463 303 3DMark IS Unlimited 24,256 12,431 30,970 21,659 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 31 5.5 31 32.4 CF-Bench 18,495 31,695 43,033 N/A *SunSpider: Lower scores are better. **Average scores for the 8.4- and 10.5-inch models. This might go without saying, but I can't help but feel the Nexus 9 really got short-changed when it came to our usual slew of benchmarks, thanks at least in part to the architecture of NVIDIA's 64-bit Tegra K1 chipset. You see, this version of the K1 has a dual-core processor configuration rather than the quartet of cores the 32-bit edition spotted in the NVIDIA Shield tablet, and that made for some rather interesting dips in the 9's Quadrant and CF-Bench scores. That said, the Nexus 9 put up some stronger numbers when it came to tests that relied on more visual pizzazz, like GFXBench's offscreen Manhattan rendering and 3DMark's Ice Storm. Curious, I pitted the K1-toting Nexus 9 and Shield tablet against each other in a few more tests -- the 9 boasted a stronger single-core score than the Shield in Geekbench 3 (1,643 vs. 1,074), but the multi-core score definitely skewed in the Shield's favor. The thing about these synthetic benchmarks is that they can't tell the true story of a gadget all on their lonesome. Going off the numbers you see above would lead you to believe that the Nexus 9 is some sort of mediocre also-ran. If you glean one thing from this section, make sure it's the knowledge that despite some seemingly off-kilter numbers, the Nexus 9 can and will handle just about anything you throw at it. As I made abundantly clear in the software section, the Nexus 9 runs incredibly smoothly while you poke around the OS and launch apps. That sort of computational oomph carries over into graphically intense situations like games, too -- just what you'd expect from a chipset with the K1's pedigree. You might remember that the quad-core, 32-bit version was featured in NVIDIA's own Shield tablet not long ago, where it helped the thing push pixels with plenty of grace and fluidity. The 64-bit variant (and its similar assortment of 192 Kepler GPU cores) inside the Nexus 9 is meant to step things up even further, and it shows. Watching the events of R\u00e9publique unfold was as fluid and as engrossing an experience as I've seen on a tablet, and taking hard corners in Asphalt 8 looked as gorgeous as ever, even with its graphics settings cranked up. There's just one concerning bit to note: The top-right corner of the tablet (presumably where its brains are located) can get very warm once you starting pushing it around. In my case, it was most apparent while swatting at pumpkin-headed zombies in Dead Trigger 2 -- I haven't noticed the thing getting alarmingly hot, but I did occasionally wonder whether I was gripping a tablet or a warm cup of tea. Google claims that the Nexus 9's battery will hang in there for about 9.5 hours on a charge if you're surfing the web or watching videos, and my initial spin with the slate fell just short of that mark. It was nothing if not an able companion as I plowed through my daily routine, sticking with me through about 12 hours of mixed usage (you know, web browsing, shooting off emails, the odd gaming break in the bathroom, with plenty of standby time mixed in between). The first few times through our standard video rundown test (with an HD video set to loop indefinitely while screen brightness is locked at 50 percent), the Nexus 9 usually managed to hang in there for about 9 hours and 10 minutes before giving up the ghost. Here's the thing, though: Google dropped one last big software update on us yesterday -- it's the version that's shipping on the Nexus 9s you'll get -- and right now I'm retesting the battery to see if we can squeeze even more out of it. Configuration options and the competition After slogging through those thousands of words, you've probably got a good sense of what the Nexus 9 brings to the table. Right now you can claim either a WiFi-only Lunar White or Indigo Black model with 16GB of internal storage for $399 (there's a handsome Sand model that isn't ready just yet). Since you don't have the option of sticking a memory card in there, you'll probably want to shell out the extra $80 to double your storage capacity too. Oh, what's that? You're a big spender? As the most premium member of the family, the 32GB LTE/HSPA+/EV-DO/GSM model will be right up your alley -- it's not quite ready for public consumption yet, but it'll cost $599 when it ships. Now the question is, well, what other tablets out there are worth your cash and consideration? As I noted before, the Nexus 9's screen -- while totally adequate -- is unlikely to knock your socks off. If that's the sort of experience you're after, consider Samsung's Galaxy Tab S family, a pair of ultra-slim slates that pack some of the prettiest Super AMOLED screens we've ever seen. The most basic model runs at $400, and has a slightly smaller 8.4-inch display running at a mind-boggling 2,560 x 1,600 (that's the most pixel-dense AMOLED you can find on a tablet). That's not to say there aren't trade-offs, though. The combination of Samsung's bloatware fetish and the tablet's 1.9GHz Exynos 5 Octa 5420 processor means you're prone to hit more hiccups than on the Nexus 9. Meanwhile, if you're a media buff who digs the idea of a nearly 9-inch screen, you'll want to consider Amazon's Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. Its screen measures the same diagonally as the Nexus 9, but it squeezes even more pixels into all that space, and the aspect ratio is stretched out to a more video-friendly 16:10 so you can plow through all those Amazon Prime movies with fewer black bars in sight. The plus side: Amazon didn't pussyfoot around with design, so it's noticeably slimmer and lighter than the Nexus 9 to boot. It's just a touch cheaper than the Nexus 9, too: The basic 16GB WiFi model will only set you back $379. Of course, all of the above assumes you're already dead-set on an Android slate. If that's not the case, you'll want to consider Apple's iPad Air 2: It's thinner and roughly the same weight as the Nexus 9 despite its bigger screen, and it starts at $499 if you think 16GB of storage will suffice. And in the event you're looking for a taste of untainted Lollipop, let me offer a more unorthodox choice: How about the Nexus 6? Its 6-inch screen means it's close enough to tablet territory for some people, and for now, the Android 5.0 pickings are pretty slim. Of course, you'll want to wait until we publish our full Nexus 6 review before deciding one way or the other, but it's at least worth keeping in the back of your head. Wrap-up I didn't expect to feel so torn about the Nexus 9. On the one hand, Android 5.0 Lollipop is refreshing, what with its snappiness and welcoming redesign. On the other, I can't help but feel a little frustrated that Google and HTC compromised on the Nexus 9's screen, speakers and design. I get the rationale. The software's the real highlight here, so they didn't feel the need to go bonkers with the hardware niceties (and the costs that come with them). What that all boils down to is a tablet that's stunning in some ways and seemingly average in others. Long story short: If you want to live on Android's bleeding edge, buy a Nexus 9. Buy it because of Lollipop. Those few shortcomings won't overshadow all the good that Google and HTC have done here. But if that's not you -- if you don't demand the latest software that springs forth from Mountain View's depths as soon as it's ready -- there are plenty of attractive options that might fit your life a little better.

ASUS isn't quite as prominent as other names on that list, but that just makes its $200 ZenWatch all the more interesting The Taiwanese company -- probably best known for its quirky phone-tablet hybrids -- has put together an inaugural smartwatch that's dripping with style. In fact, it's the first smartwatch I've worn that's ever attracted random compliments from passersby (in two countries, no less), not to mention the first one that didn't make me feel like a complete nerd while wearing it. Alas, it takes more than just a sweet face to make a smartwatch worth owning. Gallery | 24 Photos ASUS ZenWatch review + See all 24 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 75 ASUS ZenWatch Pros Handsome, understated design Feels good on your wrist Inexpensive compared to competing models Cons Mediocre battery life Clasp can get in the way of clothes Heart rate monitor isn't always reliable Summary ASUS's first Android Wear watch is one of the most stylish we've seen, and feels great on the wrist, to boot. Unfortunately, it suffers form mediocre battery life, an erratic heart monitor and an unsightly bezel surrounding the screen. In the end, though, the ZenWatch's balance of looks, performance and relatively low price make it a worthy choice for anyone who wants an Android Wear device and doesn't want to wait for all those second-gen models to come out. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware A sense of style and personality is crucial for wearables; it's the difference between tossing something in the drawer after it's technically obsolete and wearing it anyway just because you like it. The ZenWatch falls squarely into that latter category, at least as far as I'm concerned. ASUS has put together a handsome, understated piece of kit that many people will feel proud wearing. So what's so nice about it? Well, for starters, the simple, curvy chassis is hewn from two layers of stainless steel sandwiching a rosy gold, steel midsection that helps to break up what otherwise would've been a monotonous, 75-gram silver slab. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think the rounded \"2.5D\" body and two-tone trim were smart decisions -- they make the watch feel understated and classy in a market that all too easily forgets what those words mean. In that respect, the ZenWatch lands somewhere in between the first, utilitarian batch of Android Wear watches and newer, flashier models like the Moto 360 and LG G Watch R. Definitely not a bad niche to camp out in. You might not agree with ASUS' design choices, but you can't blame the company for shooting for style when it has the same dual-core 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 and 512 of RAM that've popped up in nearly every other Android Wear watch to date. There's also 4GB of flash storage under the hood in case you want to listen to music on the run without having to lug around a phone while you're at it, though that's hardly novel either. My review unit came with a caramel-colored, stitched leather wristband that's both fetching and comfortable, a proposition that's tougher to nail than you might think. I'm no watch maven, but I've come across plenty of pretty leather straps that are too stiff and creaky until they're properly broken in. Not so here. The ZenWatch's band felt supple on my wrist from the get-go. And hey, you can swap out that stock leather band with any other 22mm strap you've got lying around. That's probably for the best too, especially if you're the sort to wear snug shirts: At its biggest, the metallic clasp that lashes one end of the band to the other is even thicker than the watch itself, making it sometimes troublesome to pull a sleeve over. On the plus side, the ZenWatch's body is water-resistant, so it'll survive bathroom splashes and other accidents (just try to keep the water away from all that leather). Right, that's enough fawning -- let's get to the disappointing stuff. Sitting right up top is the square, 1.63-inch AMOLED screen swathed in a de rigueur panel of Corning's Gorilla Glass 3 to keep it from getting banged up. Unfortunately, there's quite a bit of bezel separating the ring of steel trim from the screen itself, and it's probably the most disappointing thing about the ZenWatch's looks. All that unused space makes the screen seem smaller than it actually is, and it doesn't help that the bezel has a slightly textured look as if it's just begging to be noticed. Some better button placement would've helped a lot, too. We'll dig into the software in a bit, but here's a quick spoiler: The folks at ASUS seem to be huge fans of the analog clock aesthetic, so a crown wouldn't look too out of place on the ZenWatch. Frankly, it'd make a much better power button than the one we actually got; it's a tiny little thing that sits flush with the rest of the body, so it's tough to find by feel alone. Display Let's just get this out of the way now: The ZenWatch's 1.63-inch AMOLED screen isn't eye-catchingly round like some others out there, but that's no reason to write it off. After all, didn't a wise bard note ages ago that it's hip to be square? Painfully dated jokes aside, the screen's generally a pleasure to cast your eyes on, even if those peepers have been spoiled by the smartphone the watch is connected to. It runs at 320 x 320 (that's a pixel density of 278 ppi, if you're keeping count), making it marginally crisper than the G Watch R, though Sony's SmartWatch 3 still beats it by a hair. Your eyes almost certainly won't notice a few extra pixels per linear inch, though, so there's not much point in getting too worked up over pixel density -- the ZenWatch's display is more than crisp enough to please all but the most scrutinous screen snobs. Oh, and since you'll be glancing down at an AMOLED screen, the bold colors Google likes are lively and vibrant with deep, sumptuous blacks to match. We're still a ways off from the holy grail -- a digital watch face that's as crisp and substantial as a physical one -- but this generation of wearables hasn't exactly left us wanting either. Then again, there's the matter of all that stuff around the screen. I've already mentioned the expanses of bezel surrounding the screen, and man -- I can't ever not notice it. Maybe it's because the rest of the watch is so clean, so elegant that the bezel just seems like filler. At the very least, it would've been nice if ASUS fitted an ambient light sensor tucked away in there, but no dice. You'll have to choose from one of five brightness levels manually, a process that takes a total of four to five swipes and taps to get where you'd need to go. My time with the ZenWatch has mostly been spent with screen brightness dialed up halfway and I never had trouble seeing who was furiously texting me, even under the light of the harsh winter sun. By default, you can smack your palm down on the screen to shut it off, though 99 percent of the time I just waited the few seconds for the screen to do it on its own. In use Go ahead, pick up any Android Wear watch and start poking around. I'll wait. It won't take you long to realize that beyond all the cosmetic niceties -- the chassis, the bands, the different watch faces -- they're all basically the same. The incessant flow of information in the form of Google Now cards and notifications? Mostly impeccable voice recognition for taking notes, issuing responses and launching apps? Tap-and-swipe-friendly navigation? All of the core bits are here on the ZenWatch and work just the way they always have, so forgive me for not dwelling on them much. It's a testament to Google's grip on the platform, but it puts the onus on smartwatch makers to turn something so uniform and consistent into something special. In the case of the ZenWatch, most of those special bits lean on a separate Android app called ZenWatch Manager. From there, you can customize the colors of the seven included non-Googly watch faces, and fire up extra features like a proximity warning to alert you when you've wandered away from your phone and the option to mute your phone's ringer by clamping your hand over your watch. Useful, though not exactly thrilling. Just beware the occasionally spotty English that pops up now and again -- whenever I modify a watch face, a dialog box cheerfully confirms that my changes have been saved and says, \"You could select the watch face on your watch to use it.\" I could, but should I? Gallery | 9 Photos ASUS ZenWatch smartphone apps + See all 9 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") ASUS also crafted a handful of apps for your phone that hook into the ZenWatch hardware, though you'll probably wonder why anyone thought they needed to exist. Consider Remote Camera for instance, an app that turns your watch into a combination viewfinder/remote shutter. It sounds nifty, but it's mostly silly in practice since you'll rarely find yourself in a situation when it isn't easier to just tap your phone's shutter button instead. Group selfies, maybe? You could feasibly use your phone as some sort of GoPro-esque action camera with the ZenWatch as a second screen, but you'd have to remain within Bluetooth range of the phone the entire time. Since every wearable is concerned with your state of being, there's a heart rate monitor baked into the metal frame to help you keep tabs on your ticker. Unlike the heart sensors built into watches like the Moto 360, though, you'll have to place two fingers on that stretch of metal to get your reading. Problem is, the results are wildly inconsistent. While lounging in an uncomfortable airplane seat, the ZenWatch thought resting my heart rate leapt from 49 beats per minute to 65 to a whopping 172 within the span of about three minutes. If that was at all accurate, I should've asked a flight attendant to find a doctor on board stat, but I survived that flight just fine, thanks very much. An additional Wellness app for your connected phone keeps tabs on your movement and heart rate data (sketchy though the latter may be) and plots it all on a daily timeline for you to skim. Curiously, the app also lets you view your heart rate in terms of relaxation in case you didn't know how stressed you were at any given moment. Yeah, really. I'd just as soon stick to the Jawbone Up app that comes preloaded on the watch. It's a worthy supplement to Google's own Fit heath-tracking platform. Over the years, I've burned through no less than three Jawbone Ups/Up24s thanks to seemingly shoddy quality control, a bummer considering Jawbone's mobile app is one of the more pleasant on-the-go fitness apps you'll find; it's heartening to be able to use it again with hardware that I'm not constantly fretting over. If anything, it's the little disappointments that seem to sting the most. I'd occasionally miss a notification (or even worse, an alarm early in the morning) just because the vibration motor thrumming on my wrist was too weak to catch my attention. Oh, and the accelerometer very rarely had trouble keeping up when I brought the watch up to my face, so I occasionally had to crank my wrist like I was revving a motorcycle to bring up the full display. Performance and battery life The ZenWatch has the same innards as several other Android Wear devices, like the G Watch R, right down to the 4GB of internal storage for your tunes. Naturally, that means the ZenWatch performs just as well as the rest of its rivals: Swiping through app and notification cards is usually pretty snappy, though you might spot some slowdown when you're trying to dismiss loads of them one after the other. It's still a little tricky to quantify how well these things perform in the real world, but hey -- even at its slowest, the ZenWatch managed never to be outright irritating. Considering all the bits of code and silicon needed to keep a smartwatch running smoothly, that's still a notable feat. Now we're getting to the part you're probably most interested in: battery life. I used the ZenWatch every day over the course of two weeks, and those days were spent triaging a pretty steady stream of Hangouts messages, emails and Google Now info blasts. Throw in plenty of wrist-talking and you've got a situation that skews more toward the power-user end of the spectrum. On those heavier days, the watch's 369mAh battery would keep ticking for about 13 or 14 straight hours before giving up the ghost. That's about on par with what people are getting out of a post-update Moto 360, and just a hair better than what we saw with Samsung's Gear Live. Here's the thing, though: Your mileage is almost definitely going to vary from mine, depending on how frenzied your average day is. With any luck, your wrist won't be blowing up constantly, so you can enjoy the simple pleasure of looking at the time for longer. Speaking of, what happens when you just want to use it as a watch, no smarts involved? Well, with Airplane Mode and the always-on display enabled, the ZenWatch generally stuck around for closer to 20 hours or so before it needed a spin in the awkward, little charging dock that comes with it. Naturally, once you shut off the always-on feature, the watch lasts quite a bit longer; I could usually use the thing for nearly two whole working days. The competition The number of Android Wear watches out there is starting to swell, and that leaves us with one weighty question to ponder: How does the $200 ZenWatch compare to everything else on the market? Well, its looks and build quality alone are enough to warrant a purchase over the first-gen Samsung Gear Live and LG G Watch, especially considering the latter still somehow costs an extra $30 over the others. The remainder of the ZenWatch's rivals are a bit more style-conscious, and at that point it all comes down to which approach you prefer. Both LG's G Watch R and the Moto 360 come with those handsome round displays, and they score points for having heart rate monitors that you don't need to mash your fingers onto. Those little advancements are going to cost you though: The new G Watch R will set you back a cool $299 (honestly a little ludicrous for an Android Wear device), while the Moto 360 is a bit easier on your wallet, at $250. To be honest, I swooned hard when the 360 was first unveiled -- and so did many of our readers -- so it just might be worth the $50 premium. Oh, and if you don't mind its purely utilitarian looks and need something that doubles as a workout partner, Sony's $250 SmartWatch 3 might also be a good fit. We're still waiting to officially put that guy through its paces, though early reviews seem plenty promising. Wrap-up There's still no such thing as a perfect Android Wear watch, but ASUS' first offering sadly doesn't do much to stand above the crowd. The ZenWatch's design is the biggest reason to own one -- it's subtly stylish and comfortable in a way that other players' efforts just aren't. All things considered, ASUS has a solid grasp on the smartwatch basics, but I spent my weeks with the thing hoping to be pleasantly surprised by more than how good it looks. Performance is on par with the rest of the pack. Battery life is better than middle of the road, but only just. Needless to say, that pleasant surprise never came. Thing is, it's not entirely the company's fault: We're still watching Android Wear take its baby steps, and not a single company totally understands what features need to be added to the mix. On the flip side, the ZenWatch will only set you back $200 -- a fair bit less than what you'd pay for the Moto 360 or G Watch R. If you absolutely have to own an Android Wear device, then, you could do a lot worse than this, especially if you're tired of smartwatches that look super-masculine or like sports accoutrements. Sadly, months after Android Wear's launch, that'll still be a big \"if\" for most of you. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android wear, androidwear, asus, asus zenwatch, asuszenwatch, mobilepostcross, review, smartwatch, uk-reviews, zenwatch \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21114240 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21114240\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android-wear/\"> Google Android Wear </a> Google Android Wear Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android-wear/\" title=\"Google Android Wear reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Type Mobile / embedded OS Source model Open Released 2014-07-07 see all specs \u2192 7average user rating Ease of use 8 Speed 4 Configurability 2 Ecosystem (apps, drivers, etc.) 10 Openness 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 0 Moto 360 Pricing 0 Smartwatch that keeps the calendar locally? 2 Best Must Have Apps For Android Wear Talk about the Google Android Wear with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/asus/zenwatch/\"> ASUS ZenWatch </a> ASUS ZenWatch Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/asus/zenwatch/\" title=\"ASUS ZenWatch reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 6 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Other Operating system Android Screen size 1.63 inches Storage type Internal storage (4 GB, Flash) Announced 2014-09-03 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Features 8.7 Display 8.3 Battery life 8.7 Ease of use 9.3 Storage capacity 9.2 Design and form factor 10 Portability (size / weight) 9.7 Durability 8.7 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 1 ASUS ZenWatch Talk about the ASUS ZenWatch with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 lab.scriptBs('gravity.js') onBreak({ 0: function(){}, 320: function(){}, 768: function(){} }); ", "title": "ASUS ZenWatch review: subtle and stylish, with a few shortcomings"},
{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/03/moto-g-review-2014/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "October 3rd 2014 at 11:00 am", "body": " Last year's Moto G took us all by surprise. Sure, we knew Motorola wanted to reinvent the cheap smartphone experience, but the very first device in the company's cost crusade was even better than we expected. Let's be honest, though: The G's greatest asset was its small, small price tag. For $180 off-contract, it became awfully easy to forgive the thing for not being the quickest, the prettiest or the smartest. Still, it was one of those gadgets that wound up being more than just \"good enough\"; between the price and performance, the Moto G was one of the best cheap smartphones you could own, period. Here we are less than a year later, and we've got a sequel to play with (one with the same name, no less). If you took a quick peek at what it brings to the table, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Motorola wanted to play it safe the second time around -- the new Moto G isn't a game changer, and it doesn't have to be. Does this year's model clear the \"good enough\" bar once again? And just how far will $180 take you this year? Gallery | 20 Photos Moto G review (2014) + See all 20 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 86 Motorola Moto G (2014) Pros Camera is much better than the original's Near-stock Android 4.4.4 is a treat Feels snappy despite aging internals Inexpensive Cons No LTE Screen isn't as crisp as last year's model Summary Motorola's wallet-friendly formula hasn't changed much since last year's Moto G, but that's OK -- the company changed just enough to make the 2014 version one of the best budget smartphones out there.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware I don't mean to sound cynical here, but if you've seen one modern Motorola smartphone, you've just seen them all. Seriously. Motorola is still enamored with those curved backs, clean faces and dimpled logos. Other details of the design are carryovers too, including the headphone jack centered along the phone's top edge, and the faintest hints of color circling the 8-megapixel rear camera. All of that taken together means this year's Moto G looks an awful lot like last year's batch of Motorola handsets with just a few notable differences. For one, a more expansive, 5-inch 720p display fills the front -- it's barely bounded by bezels on the left and right, while a shiny pair of front-facing speaker grilles above and below the screen helps the G pull off a convincing Moto E impersonation. You won't notice the tiny, white notification light next to the pinprick of a front-facing camera until someone shoots you an email or writes on your Facebook wall, though your eye will occasionally dart to the proximity sensor sitting below the topmost speaker (especially if your phone is white, like mine was). That's about it in terms of visual flair -- the G in its default state is as subtle as ever, but you can trick it out with any number of Motorola's colorful backplates and cases. As it turns out, that bigger screen winds up being a blessing and a curse. Your apps and emails have more room to stretch out and breathe, but this year's Moto G is also a little less comfortable to hold because of it. That's a shame since Motorola did an outstanding job making the new Moto X feel slimmer than it is by tapering the sides. Here, those edges are flat and substantial, and while they don't make the phone feel small, they do give your hands more surface area to grip -- not a bad deal for any butterfingers reading this. You might also notice a hint of slack between the removable back plate and the rest of the phone, but that's just me being nitpicky. If you thought the Moto G's looks were more of the same, just wait until you see what's lurking inside. This year's model has the same quad-core 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 as its predecessor, along with the same 1GB of RAM. That both generations of the G basically share a brain isn't necessarily a bad thing -- we quite enjoyed the horsepower we squeezed out of it last year -- but I couldn't help but hope Motorola would use a more powerful configuration this year. The similarities don't end there either: Both versions of the G run with the same non-removable 2,070mAh battery, which, at first blush, seems a silly choice. Why would anyone stick the same ol' battery in a new device with a bigger screen to light up? It's another one of those price-performance balancing acts Motorola had to cope with, and since this thing has the same brain and the same lack of LTE support (HSPA all the way) as the original G, I guess popping in a more powerful cell wasn't deemed crucial. If it makes you feel any better, though, there's now a microSD card slot behind the back cover to supplement the meager 8GB of storage, and an alternate version of the phone sports two SIM card slots instead of one. Display and sound Of all the surprises that first Moto G brought to the table, its 4.5-inch, 720p screen was one of the most pleasant. Impressive clarity? Accurate colors? Solid viewing angles? The original G had them all, and the sequel's 5-inch display fares almost as well. Yes, almost. There are a few bummers at play here, but the most notable is the slight dip in sharpness since the screen uses the same number of pixels to fill even more space. If you've got a spare moment, you can peer very intently and pick out those individual pixels; you're ultimately left with a screen that looks softer and less crisp than the one that came before it. The bigger question, though, is how much that actually matters. My answer? Hardly at all. It's not going to be a dealbreaker for anyone but the most persnickety screen hounds. More importantly, the Gorilla Glass 3-clad display is spacious, bright and plenty vivid, though colors didn't seem quite as poppy and saturated as they did on the original Moto G. Personally, I prefer it when colors border on lurid (gotta love those AMOLED screens), so the screen feels just a little lifeless to me. Of course, though, your mileage will vary on that one. Alas, things take a turn when you start looking at dark pages or videos: My review unit has some pretty noticeable backlight bleeding at four discrete spots near the center of the screen. Those stray photons shouldn't be terribly bothersome for most, but my eyes couldn't help but gravitate toward them while poking through a dark app or sitting in dimly lit rooms. On the plus side, the silver-trimmed speakers bounding that screen are a damned sight better than the single, wimpy driver that sat low on the original G's rear end. The difference is dramatic -- they get louder than you'd expect without getting too muddy or distorted -- but don't expect any HTC One-style auditory revelations when you crank things up. Software Hate bloatware? Love the buttery smoothness of unfettered Android? You'll find plenty to like here. We can actually keep this bit short and sweet: The Moto G's build of Android 4.4.4 is just about untouched, a feat that (for better or worse) wasn't replicated by its big brother. Sadly, this also means that the thoughtful tricks the Moto X could pull off are nowhere to be found. This shouldn't come as a shock: The G still lacks the additional processing cores that made those tricks possible, but they're hard to give up if you've used them (or have seen them in action) on a Moto X. With the exception of Motorola's Migrate, Assist and Alert apps, there's just about nothing non-Googly in origin here. Thankfully, those apps occasionally come in pretty handy. As the name implies, Motorola Migrate lets you transfer messages, contacts and calendar events (whatever doesn't come through when you set up the phone with your Google account, really) from another Android phone or straight from Apple's iCloud. Assist pitches in when it can tell you're in a meeting or when it's your bedtime by automatically silencing itself. Alert, on the other hand, is a sort of a location-based, catchall app where you can broadcast your location to friends (\u00e0 la Glympse), as well as set up notifications for preset contacts and emergency services if you ever feel you're in danger. Setting up that list of important contacts doesn't take more than a few moments, and triggering the emergency mode is just as simple -- a single tap of a button initiates a 5-second countdown before your phone starts reaching out to everyone on the list. All told, it's a largely dummy-proof lifeline should your situation go south in a heartbeat. Here's hoping you won't ever need to use it as one. Camera None of the smartphones that Motorola pieced together over the last 12 months have had cameras that have blown us away -- care to take a guess at how the Moto G fared? Bingo! Welcome back to the middle of the road, at least compared to the current crop of smartphones floating around the market. That might sound like I'm damning the G with faint praise, but believe me: The 8-megapixel sensor Motorola's got in there is a big, big improvement over the 5-megapixel camera in last year's model. As usual, photons are your friends and you're going to want as many of them around as possible if you want to coax your Moto G into performing its best. Under those conditions, expect to see lively colors and a bountiful amount of detail (the fact that HDR is set to \"Auto\" by default usually helps with that). It actually does pretty well once the light starts to fade, too -- graininess becomes a problem after a while, but the sensor is more than capable of coping when the sun dips behind clouds or starts to inch closer to the horizon. Gallery | 16 Photos Moto G (2014) sample shots + See all 16 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Up front, the tiny 2-megapixel, front-facing camera performs about as well as you'd expect. It'll do in a pinch when it's time for a video Hangout, but I've noticed the same sort of ghostly delay when trying to frame up a shot that I did on the Moto X. Strangely, the issue isn't as prominent here as it was on the higher-end X, so you won't get too frustrated trying to snap a decent selfie or eight. Meanwhile, flipping into video mode is a quick process but the results definitely won't wow: video resolution tops out at 720p and footage is all too often soft and unsatisfying. I've praised Motorola's dead-simple camera interface in the past, and I'll do it again: The one-touch process of snapping a photo is impossible to screw up, and the settings offer enough depth to enable some handsome shots without overwhelming you with options. That said, it does take some getting used to. Tapping anywhere on the screen to snap a photo seems awfully smart until you realize that lots of other camera apps have you tap on the screen to focus or control exposure; if that sounds like what your current phone does, prepare to fight your muscle memory for a while. The fact that you've also got to drag a reticle around to change focus and then tap means it'll sometimes take longer to capture a scene than Motorola would like you to think. Performance and battery life The Moto G's spec list doesn't do it many favors. Here's the thing to remember, though: While it uses a year-old chipset, the 2014 Moto G runs lean. The lack of an obnoxious, overwrought user interface means it can dedicate that available horsepower to more important things, and it shows. I spent my days testing the G as I usually do: sending off messages, jumping into Hangouts, scrolling through long web pages, firing up apps, flipping among those apps as they run and generally being a fidgety brat trying to stymie those long-in-the-tooth internals. The verdict? Once again, the Moto G handled just about everything I threw at it with grace and gusto. Jumping out of Asphalt 8 (which ran more than admirably even at the highest settings) into The Battle Cats for a spot of feline world domination made the phone seize up for a few moments while it tried to cope, but it was almost always snappy and responsive, even while I did my best to break it. Moto G (2014) Moto X (2014) Moto G Quadrant 2.0 8,846 22,721 8,723 Vellamo 3.0 1,669 2,093 1,575 3DMark IS Unlimited 4,679 19,568 4,621 SunSpider 1.0.2 (ms) 1,534 787 1,377 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan Offscreen (fps) N/A 11.9 1.7 CF-Bench 14,470 39,018 15,030 SunSpider: Lower scores are better; results compiled on Chrome. Meanwhile, the tale of the tape tells a familiar story. The results above are in line with what we squeezed out of the first Moto G, but for some reason, I had a hell of time trying to complete the GFXBench test; it kept returning an \"Out Of Memory\" error when attempting to render 1080p footage offscreen. Ill omen? Perhaps, but the G didn't disappoint when it came to running graphically intensive apps (and it isn't the first Moto handset that balked at that particular test, so I wouldn't worry about it too much). And now, we return to the elephant in the room: battery life. Remember, Motorola hasn't touched the battery, so we're looking at the same 2,070mAh cell from last year's model powering a phone with a bigger screen. Sounds like a recipe for disaster, no? Thankfully, the situation isn't nearly as dire as it could've been: In our video-looping test (with screen brightness set to 50 percent) the G stuck it out for seven hours and 38 minutes. For those of you keeping track, that's only a hair less than the 7:48 the original Moto G was able to manage. Not too shabby, especially when you factor in how it handles when you're not looping a video for hours on end. The Moto G became my daily driver for a week, and it always managed to keep me texting, tweeting, calling and playing the odd game for full work days (and then some) at a time. For me, that worked out to just shy of 13 hours of active usage, though it goes without saying that your experience will probably differ somewhat from mine. The competition There's no shortage of phones that stack up the Moto G based on pure power, but it's a whole other ball game when we factor in that cheapo price tag. Consider the HTC One Mini 2 -- you'll get the same quad-core Snapdragon chipset as the Moto G, albeit wrapped in a chic aluminum shell and paired with a (lackluster) 13-megapixel camera. Doesn't sound like a bad package... until you notice that it's staggeringly more expensive than Motorola's latest. The Desire 510, meanwhile, is a slightly more worthy competitor with its LTE radio and its newer 1.2GHz Snapdragon 410 chip, though its 4.7-inch screen is even less pixel dense than the G. It doesn't yet have an official release date here in the States (where it'll be available for free or $149 on Sprint and Cricket, respectively), but in Canada, the 510 will only set you back $200. If good, ol' fashioned HSPA+ isn't enough for you, there's always the LTE-enabled version of the original Moto G to lean on. The camera's much less impressive, but it's a bit easier to wrap your hands around and you're looking at much snappier data speeds if your provider is wired up to offer those sweet, sweet LTE signals. Just be prepared to pony up a little extra come checkout time: The Moto G 4G LTE (who comes up with these names?) costs $219, a full $40 more than the new edition. Of course, if you're not married to the prospect of owning an Android phone, there's the iPhone 5c -- these days it's free with a contract, while going without will cost a cool $450. It's only wallet-friendly under the right circumstances, though; you're the only one who can decide if pledging allegiance to Cupertino is worth it. Wrap-up This won't be a phone that you fall hard and fast for. It won't sweep you off your feet, nor will it dazzle you with a slew of whizbang features. That's just fine, though. Because none of that changes the fact that the Moto G is still one of the best budget smartphones you can buy today. Using the thing isn't as revelatory an experience as firing up the new Moto X was, but Motorola's long list of seemingly modest improvements collectively add up to a device that's worth your attention -- and the $180 asking price. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: mobilepostcross, moto g, moto g 2014, motog, motog2014, motorola, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20970200 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20970200\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/moto/g/2nd-gen/\"> Motorola Moto G 2nd-gen </a> Motorola Moto G 2nd-gen Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/moto/g/2nd-gen/\" title=\"Motorola Moto G 2nd-gen reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 8 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android (KitKat [4.4]) Screen size 5 inches Internal memory 16 GB Camera 8\u00a0megapixels Dimensions 5.57 x 2.78 x 0.43 in Weight 5.26 oz Released 2014-09-05 see all specs \u2192 7average user rating Reception and call quality 7.5 Display 7.8 Battery life 6.5 Camera 6.5 Ease of use 8.8 Design and form factor 8.3 Portability (size / weight) 7.5 Media support 8.5 Durability 6 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 7.8 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 2 Non-removable battery 2 Do any retailers carry this in-store? 0 MOTO G2 Problems Talk about the Motorola Moto G 2nd-gen with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 lab.scriptBs('gravity.js') onBreak({ 0: function(){}, 320: function(){}, 768: function(){} }); ", "title": "Moto G review (2014): still the best budget smartphone"},

Try something completely different in hopes you'll catch lightning in a bottle again, or keep plugging away on the mobile DNA that made you such a worthy name in the first place? If you're HTC, the answer is obvious: You keep polishing and polishing that formula until you finally reach the ideal you've been working toward. That's what we have in the One M9. It's still a ways off from fulfilling the vision that HTC's design wonks had in mind, but in most ways it's a very thoughtful refinement of what made the One series so special.

It's sturdy and plenty powerful with its Snapdragon 810 chipset, but the M9's 20-megapixel camera doesn't seem any better than the UltraPixel shooter HTC ditched, and the occasional software quirk raises eyebrows. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Note: I'm working with the international version of the One M9. I'll update this review with new impressions once US units become available. It's impossible not to compare the M9 to the Ones that came before it, which leads to some simple shorthand for HTC's design work this year: Put simply, it's almost like the M7 and M8 had a baby. Where the M8 was polished and curvaceous like a river stone -- a choice that meant the thing slid around more than some liked -- the M9 channels more of the original One M7's angularity. HTC's newest flagship feels familiar as a result, but that's not to say that everything HTC did was for the best. Anyway, more on that later. Let's start with the broad strokes. The M9's sloping back would look almost identical to its predecessors were it not for some major camera changes: Last year's Duo Camera UltraPixel setup has been replaced with a single, squarish, sapphire-covered pod that hosts a more traditional 20-megapixel shooter. Thankfully, none of that changes how comfortably the M9 settles into the hand. You'll find the nano-SIM and microSD card slots (the latter of which takes cards up to a whopping 2TB) nestled into the left and right edges, respectively, just where they were last year. The lengthy volume rocker that ran down the previous phone's side has been split into two discrete buttons, though, and the sleep/wake key has been moved below it and was given a neat spiral pattern so you can tell the difference without looking. At first glance, the phone's face is almost identical too. The only real changes you'll notice when that 5-inch, 1080p screen is off are incredibly subtle ones, like the top BoomSound speaker being a little shorter to accommodate the bigger UltraPixel selfie camera. Hell, you might not even notice one of the quietest structural changes -- the M9 is the first One with a front plate hewn from a single block of aluminum, with holes machined in to hold the screen and speakers in place. It's an impressive feat of production, but it's not like it makes the M9 feel any sturdier than it already is. Come to think of it, it's that kind of minute change that seems emblematic of the M9's overall aesthetic. In most ways, we're still dealing with the same One DNA as before, just peppered with a handful of modifications meant to make the whole thing feel more premium. Consider the color, for one: My review unit is the same two-toned, rose-gold-and-silver affair I first played with back at MWC, and it's still just as polarizing as it was a few weeks ago. I've grown inordinately fond of the color combination, though others who saw it were less than impressed by the company flinging itself onto a gold-hued bandwagon. Thankfully, you'll soon be able to pick up full-on silver or gunmetal models too. More importantly, the M9 sits in my hand with just the right amount of weight and gravitas. It's light without feeling chintzy; it screams \"solid,\" maybe even a little more than the M8 did. No wonder HTC's brass has spent so much breath talking up that machined chassis. To hear them tell it, the metal's \"jewelry-grade\" finish resists scratches and crafting each M9 involves 70 steps and takes 300 minutes to complete. Similar attention has been paid to what wound up inside the phone: We're looking at one of Qualcomm's octa-core Snapdragon 810s (a bit of silicon that pairs a 2.0GHz quad-core processor with another 1.5GHz quad-core unit), 3GB of DDR4 RAM, 32GB of storage and support for super-fast LTE Cat 9 data speeds where they're available. All of that together is enough to make you wonder how well the company can produce these things at scale, but the effect is mostly wonderful. Yep, that's right: \"mostly.\" The biggest physical offender is hard to miss: The gold edge that runs around the M9's sides terminates in a pronounced ridge that feels completely out of place. Some will mind it less than others -- it does make the M9's body feel less slippery than the M8's -- but a colleague summed up my feelings best when he said it was like having the edge of a butter knife pressed into your palm. Possible butterfinger moments aside, the beauty of the M8's curves was that it made the physicality of the phone sort of fade into the background. Not so this time. At least that edge won't catch on your pockets when you whip your phone out. All told, it'd be easy to snipe at HTC for playing it too safe this year. I had to fight the temptation to do so myself. Like it or not, HTC's design chiefs have a clear sense of what they want their flagships to look and feel like and they seem more than happy to chip away in a single direction year after year. That's just great for their sense of artistry, but we'll see if people actually flock to a phone that doesn't look like a dramatic improvement over the ones that came before. Display and sound While rivals like Samsung and LG have flung their arms open to embrace Quad HD screens, HTC seems more than happy to buck the trend. Need evidence? Look no further than the M9's face -- the flagship comes loaded with a 5-inch Super LCD 3 display running at 1080p, putting it well behind the competition when it comes to sheer pixel density. Thing is, that's far more of a disadvantage on paper than in practice. After all, you'd be hard-pressed to pick out an individual pixel on the M9's display, and viewing angles are still first-rate here. What's more curious than HTC's resolution decision is just how different it is from the panel placed in the M8. Seriously. The M9's LCD is altogether much cooler than the M8's, which makes for crisper, more neutral whites at the expense of slightly less impactful blacks. I spend more time than I'd like to admit poking around on Instagram every day, but the difference couldn't have been any clearer than there -- colors were much punchier on the M8's screen, while the flower, puppy, graffiti and food pictures Instagram is notorious for came across as less saturated and, dare I say, neutered on the M9. Your mileage may vary (I've always preferred the slight oversaturation of AMOLED screens), but a certain dose of pop that made some photos come alive on last year's model is gone here, and I'm frankly bummed because of it. If there's one thing HTC knows, though, it's how to shoehorn a pair of speakers into a smartphone. BoomSound is back for a third year running and the dual-speaker setup still mostly sets a high bar for the rest of the industry's high-end wares. Yep, there's that pesky \"mostly\" again. I've run both the M8 and the M9 through my usual slew of test tracks, ranging from poppy ethereal stuff like Mika's The Origin Of Love album to Sambomaster's furious Japanese rock, and once again found that the M8 usually did a better job of reproducing classic tunes than its successor. Most times, the M8 was a touch louder and shined a little more light on the primary vocal track in the mix; meanwhile, the M9 projected a soundscape that drew me in a little more thanks to cleaner channel separation, but seemed softer in comparison. That doesn't mean the M9 is necessarily worse, just that it seems to be tuned a little differently. HTC has Dolby Audio running in the background to help give those speakers some more oomph, and I can't help but wonder if that extra software isn't to blame -- too bad there's no way to turn it off. If you're feeling really picky, you can toggle between Music and Theater modes in the settings, but I honestly couldn't make out the difference either way. Software Remember the old, overwrought days of Sense? With that gigantic weather/clock widget and HTC's insistence that basically every bit of Android had to be customized to within an inch of its life? Yeah, so do I. Those were rough times. HTC's done a great job of dialing back its influence on Android over the past few generations, and we're now left with a version of Sense that's both smarter and great at getting out of your way when you want it to. If you've spent any time at all with the M8, you'll feel right at home here -- just about all of the software features that made it what it was are back on top of Android 5.0.2, along with a few smart new bits that strive to do more than they actually can. Gallery | 39 Photos A tour of HTC's Sense 7 UI + See all 39 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Sense 7's look is pretty vanilla (and pretty Material Design-y) right out of the box. A clock widget stares back at you like it always has; BlinkFeed lives to the left of the home screen; and your app launcher is set up vertically with a customizable grid. Typical. The first new addition you'll see is the Sense Home widget, and its raison d'etre is simple -- it wants to show you apps you actually want when you're at home, work or just out somewhere. Once you've defined your home and work locations, it does a solid job of remembering what apps you tend to use where, even if it does take a while for your preferences to stick. Thankfully, you can just drag and drop your most-used apps right into the folder. HTC has expanded BlinkFeed's reach, too. In addition to giving you a grid of news and social updates to thumb through when you're bored, it'll now offer up Yelp recommendations (devices in different markets will lean on different services) when it thinks you might be jonesing for coffee or dinner. Those suggestions live atop your grid of stories to consume by default, but they'll also take over your lock screen too given enough time. It's actually a pretty great idea, but a feature like this is only really worth a damn if it knows what you like. Alas, the suggestions BlinkFeed has offered up so far haven't been earthshakers -- they just point out highly rated eateries near you, and there doesn't seem to be a way to connect it to your Yelp account to give it a sense of your tastes. Missed opportunity, HTC. If you're anything like me, though, you'll be so used to unlocking a dark screen with a swipe up that the in-your-face recommendations might go completely unnoticed anyway. To complete the \"all about you\" philosophy at play here, you can create and apply your own visual themes if the stock look is just too milquetoast for you. Fonts, icon sets, wallpapers, color schemes, sounds; all of them can be mixed and matched in HTC's Themes app, and to my utter surprise, making a Myspace-circa-2006-style train wreck is harder than you'd think. That doesn't mean it's impossible, though, and a few minutes spent poking around HTC's Themes hub is proof enough of that. After downloading and installing a slew of themes from 75 or so available at the time of writing, I got to work -- after just a few minutes of agonizing over the right Hong Kong skyline wallpaper and icon set, I created a gold-and-silver aesthetic I've been looking at with a funny sense of pride ever since. If your well of inspiration is running a little dry, you can load up an existing photo and have the app work up a color scheme straight from that. My only complaint is that you can't go as far as you might think. Some themes you download from HTC's hub come with stylized clock widgets and Android navigation keys, but you can't swap those in and out of your theme the way you can with basically everything else right on the device. Like it or not, you'll have to pop over to HTC's dedicated theming site on a desktop or tablet to get it done. Really, though, these three features are just the most blatant changes to Sense as we know it. All of Lollipop's niceties are here too, like the ability to pin apps and filter the notifications you get by priority. You can change what quick settings panels appear when you drag down your notification shade. Oh, and the traditional Back-Home-Recent Apps order for Android's navigation keys? You can finally rearrange them, add to them or swap them out for screen toggles and quick settings access. Clearly, nothing is sacred anymore. Throw in a very, very useful Help app that'll help diagnose what's up with your ailing phone, and you've got a thorough suite of software at least tries to be there for you. I haven't enjoyed a Sense-ified build this much in years, but it sure isn't perfect. For me, the biggest immediate sin is the keyboard, or more specifically, its auto-corrections. They're terrible. I'm normally willing to cut these international units some extra slack on this front, but even with the input language set to United States English, the auto-corrections and assumptions it made led to countless errors that seem puzzling in their stupidity. Is \"Im\" so frequently used that the keyboard never tries to swap in an \"I'm\" instead? \"Thjng\" was never, ever successfully corrected, even though I clearly meant \"thing\". Having an Enter key right below Backspace also meant malformed messages went out almost as frequently as proper ones. Thankfully, the Google Keyboard is just a few quick taps away in the Play Store. The Sense Home widget also recommends new apps to you in a special folder by default. It's easy enough to ditch completely, but it rubs me the wrong way for two reasons. First, HTC hasn't ruled out the possibility of sponsored suggestions, and I don't really want HTC's financial partnerships getting in the way of my carefully cultivated home screen. Second, and more important, some of these suggestions are just awful. For some reason, about a week into testing, it suggested I download an app for the Turkish equivalent of Seamless and an apparently Korean-made app that links to YouTube videos of Billboard Top 100 songs. Just... what? I'm willing to chalk this up as some quirk inherent to international models, but man, is this just silly. Camera Here's where things get a little tricky. HTC spent the better part of 2014 arguing that yes, UltraPixels were the future of mobile photography and talking up situations where that bigger pixel size is a plus. With the M9, though, that message is even more muddled. Sure, there's an UltraPixel camera up front (more on that a little later), but the primary shooter 'round the back is a 20-megapixel affair and it didn't leave much of an impression the first time I used it. Actually, scratch that. It did leave an impression, just not a very good one. Due to some sketchy pre-production software, the M9's early photos took on a peculiar greenish cast and generally looked worse than what the M8's year-old UltraPixel camera came up with in the same situations. Thankfully, most of those issues have been killed off with a patch, and we're now left with a primary camera that doesn't make me want to cry. Gallery | 23 Photos HTC One M9 camera samples + See all 23 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") In bright, consistent light, the M9 fires off detailed photos with nicely reproduced colors -- they can be a little washed out compared to the M8, though, and the cooler screen on the M9 doesn't help them look any better. Here's the rub: You'd expect this thing to be uniformly better than the UltraPixel shooter HTC's been pushing, but that's just not always the case. I'm not just talking about low-light situations where the UltraPixel camera truly shines, either. Sometimes the M9 comes through with crisper details; other times the M8 seems to do a better job. Sometimes the M9 has richer, more accurately exposed colors; sometimes it doesn't. You get where I'm going with this. It's such a mixed bag that I'm honestly surprised HTC gave in to the simplicity of advertising a camera based on its megapixel count at all. When the company dropped the news, I think we were all hoping the company's megapixel gamble would pay off in spades. Well, not so much. At least the UltraPixel selfie camera still works the way you'd expect. The lens is wide enough to capture most of your crew come Groufie time and, as usual, it excels in darker climes like bars and clubs (though you might come out looking a little pink for your liking). On the plus side, HTC's Camera app is still one of the more in-depth we've seen ship on a smartphone, and it's easy enough to dismiss gritty technical bits like exposure control, ISO and white balance if you'd rather not bother. Oh, a quick heads-up to all those serious mobile photographers -- the M9 technically supports shooting RAW photos, but good luck getting that to work without a little dedicated developer support. Swiping to the left and right still lets you hop among Panorama, Selfie and standard Photo modes, and they're actually labeled this time too! It's all about the little things sometimes. Delve deep enough into the settings and you'll discover that HTC has finally put together a phone that can shoot video in 4K, though it'll only record 6 minutes of super high-def footage in a go. Sadly, most of my test recordings suffered from the same washed-out look that the M9's photos had trouble with during most of my weeks testing. Speaking of the little things, HTC's full suite of image-editing tricks are back too, from mainstays like red-eye removal to body-horror playthings like Face Contour (seriously, run it on the same photo a few times and tell me you're not terrified). Feeling really festive? You can festoon your pictures with floating particles, be they snowflakes or cherry blossoms or shapes of your own choosing. I have no earthly idea why anyone would need this, but it's cute, so someone somewhere will surely have a blast with it. Too bad you can't save the resulting tableau as a GIF; it'll wind up being saved as a static JPEG or a video file. You'll have an easier time indulging your artsy side with the editor's new double exposure and Prismatic features, too. The former does pretty much what the name says (with occasionally freaky results like the shot above), but the latter takes a cue from apps like Fragment by letting you stick trippy polygons and line art on top of your photos. Trust me, it's cooler than it sounds. Performance and battery life HTC might not have been the first to out a Snapdragon 810-powered phone, but make no mistake: There's some seriously powerful silicon thrumming away inside the M9's metal frame. The surest sign of a strong performer is its ability to make you stop thinking about its performance altogether, and that's almost completely the case here. I've spent the better part of two weeks basically treating this thing like crap -- furiously firing up and cycling through apps, wiling away hours crashing into walls in Asphalt 8, watching high-res videos until I was bored stupid -- and I haven't yet found a scenario where the M9's combination of lightweight software and speedy hardware let me down. Now about that elephant in the room. Yes, the M9 can get almost uncomfortably warm if you make it a point to push it hard -- I noticed it mostly during my repeated benchmark testing, which most average users will never, ever have to worry about. The M9's all-metal chassis still gets warm during more normal hardware-intensive tasks like bashing zombies in the face in Dead Trigger 2, but considerably less so than during benchmarks and never to the point where I was worried about hurting myself. By now, it's more than clear that the 810 isn't a particularly cool customer, and HTC gets some props for trying to mitigate the issue before the M9's official launch. That said, the company's approach to thermal throttling seems to have had an effect on the numbers the phone put up -- the One M9 and the G Flex2 were just about neck and neck throughout the whole process, save for a few tests where the M9 scored consistently lower. HTC One M9 LG G Flex2 Samsung Galaxy Note Edge iPhone 6 Plus AndEBench Pro 7,404 7,167 8,886 N/A Vellamo 3.0 2,874 4,684 1,882 N/A 3DMark IS Unlimited 21,409 22,207 19,912 17,902 SunSpider 1.0.2 (ms) 706 667 788 388 GFXBench 3.0 1080p Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 22 21 18.4 18.2 CF-Bench 53,579 68,426 40,143 N/A SunSpider: Lower scores are better. You won't be left wanting for horsepower, but the 2,840mAh battery was more of a mixed bag. In the standard Engadget rundown test (with a video set to loop endlessly while the screen's set to 50 percent brightness), the M9 stuck around for eight hours and 19 minutes -- a decent increase over the original One M7, but far short of the 11-plus hours we squeezed out of the M8 last year and the 10-plus hours the G Flex2 put up. That seems abnormally low, especially considering that the M9 did just fine when it came to average daily use: It regularly hung around for 13 to 14 hours of continuous work use (including a few spells as a mobile hotspot during press events) without batting an eye. Using the thing judiciously could obviously pump up those numbers even more, as would firing up its Extreme Power Saving mode (though you'll lose access to all but the most crucial apps as a result). The competition I've been spending all this time with the international version of the One M9, and by the time you read this it'll have started trickling onto store shelves in a few far-flung markets. All four major US wireless carriers have pledged to carry it (no word on price yet, but the usual $650 sans contract/$200 with seems likely), so it won't be long before M9s will be all over the place. What else should you be looking at? We're starting to see the first batch of Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge reviews make the rounds, and while we haven't spent more than a half-hour with the things to date, there's no denying that they're going to be two of the M9's fiercest Android competitors this year. We're looking forward to seeing how the Snapdragon 810 in the M9 stacks up to Samsung's homespun silicon, but the M9 already seems to have a leg up on the S6 when it comes to eye candy. The S6 edge is a completely different story -- I still maintain it's the best-looking phone Samsung has ever made -- but you're going to pay a hefty premium for a phone that's functionally identical to the S6. If you need a high-powered competitor right now, there's always the G Flex2. LG beat HTC to the silicon-studded punch by bringing the Snapdragon 810-powered device to Sprint earlier this month (it'll hit AT&T soon, too) and it's strikingly pretty to boot. You'll miss out on Sense's occasional thoughtfulness and a rock-sturdy body, but LG's light touch with Android 5.0 and the sheer \"wow\" factor of a curvy phone just might be worth it for you. HTC's older One M8 is still no slouch either, and the punchier display, plus some slightly louder BoomSound speakers, might make it a contender for another year if you're persnickety about your media and don't absolutely need the latest and greatest. Wrap-up It might sound maudlin, but I really wanted to love the One M9 as much as I did the One M7. This seemed like the year HTC would nail it again. They came close! I'm still surprised that it's Sense that I'm most impressed with. BlinkFeed is a first-rate time sink, and theming is a lovely, awfully personal way to kill a few minutes and make your M9 really feel like yours. Sure, the app suggestions are so bad they're almost great for a laugh, but I can ditch them whenever I feel like it. Alas, the M9 is let down by a camera that isn't as good as it should be, strangely tuned BoomSound speakers and the occasional questionable design decision. And yet, despite those quirks, the M9 is still a very, very good phone. It's an utter powerhouse even with thermal throttling in the mix and the now-traditional One aesthetic is as attractive as it's ever been (strange metallic edge aside). That doesn't change the fact that it's still the biggest question mark of the One trio to date, and now I -- along with others, surely -- are left wondering where HTC goes next. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android, google, htc, htcone, m9, mobilepostcross, onem9, review, smartphone \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21156071 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21156071\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/htc/one/m9/\"> HTC One (M9) </a> HTC One (M9) Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/htc/one/m9/\" title=\"HTC One (M9) reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 2 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android (Lollipop [5.0]) Camera 20\u00a0megapixels Announced 2015-03-01 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Reception and call quality 10 Display 9 Battery life 7 Camera 8 Ease of use 10 Design and form factor 10 Portability (size / weight) 10 Media support 8 Durability 9 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 8 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 0 Feel obvious HTC M9 metal shell Reviews Talk about the HTC One (M9) with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 lab.scriptBs('gravity.js') onBreak({ 0: function(){}, 320: function(){}, 768: function(){} }); ", "title": "HTC One M9 review: Another year, another modest step forward"},

The Garmin Vivosmart is one such exception. It's a $170 band that does everything you'd expect a fitness gadget to do: track your steps, calories burned, distance traveled and sleep. In a unique twist, though, it also has an OLED screen showing things like emails, texts, Twitter and Facebook notifications and incoming calls. In essence, it's a full-fledged fitness tracker that also acts like a full-fledged smartwatch. The question is, can it do both jobs well? Gallery | 15 Photos Garmin Vivosmart review + See all 15 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 72 Garmin Vivosmart Pros One of the few fitness bands that also acts as a smartwatch Long battery life Adjusts your daily step goal based on recent activity The \"move bar\" is an effective reminder to get up and walk around Cons Can't delete or archive messages from the band; notifications aren't actionable Garmin Connect fitness app still doesn't offer much in the way of motivation Can be uncomfortable to wear after long periods of use Scratches easily Limited smartphone compatibility Summary Garmin deserves praise for being one of the first companies to develop a fitness band that does double-duty as a smartwatch. That said, the device suffers from some uncomfortable ergonomics and an app that offers little in the way of motivation. Meanwhile, the smartwatch-like notifications are not compelling enough to justify the Vivosmart's relatively high price. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware The Vivosmart might be a mash-up between a fitness band and a smartwatch, but it definitely doesn't look like one. No, this looks like a run-of-the-mill fitness tracker -- just a plain rubber bracelet with a hidden display that only lights up when you double-tap it. The black model I tried isn't what I would call stylish, but it's plain enough that it blends in with most outfits. (There are four other color choices besides black.) In fact, the device is so minimalist that there isn't even a charging port; just a set of charging pins on the band's underbelly, which works with a proprietary cradle. The band does have some conspicuous size-holes, along with a metal stamp bearing the Garmin logo. I'll admit I find those details a little unsightly, but most of the time they're hidden on the underside of your wrist. All told, the hardware doesn't call attention to itself, and that's a good thing. It's also comfortable -- to a point. Thanks to the rounded edges and soft finish, I could wear it through long days without getting irritated. Even then, I could sometimes feel it pressing into my wrist while I slept, which made me not want to use it for sleep tracking anymore. Also, as I continued to wear the device, I more than once created a dent in the plastic -- still not sure how I did that. On the bright side, precisely because of those size-holes I have the ability to customize the fit. It's also water-resistant in up to 50 meters of pressure -- a rating known as \"5 ATM.\" In lay terms, that means it's suitable not just for showering, but also for swimming and snorkeling. The only areas where you might want to be careful are things like surfing or any other kind of water sport where you run the risk of wiping out. For my part, I was not only able to shower with the band on, but I also continued to get notifications while submerged in a hot tub -- a reassuring sign that the device had sustained no damage. Finally, a note on battery life. The device lasts for up to seven days of runtime, according to Garmin's website. I never tried to push it quite that far, but I can attest to some very robust power management. After two and a half days of use, for example, I was still showing a half-full battery icon, and that was after a steady stream of notifications each day followed by sleep tracking at night. Getting started The Vivosmart and I didn't get off to a smooth start, but that's because I'm not very good at reading, apparently. As of this writing, the device is compatible with only a handful of Android and iOS devices, including the HTC One M7 and M8; Samsung Galaxy Note II and III; Samsung GS3, GS4, GS5 and GS4 Active; Sony Xperia Z2; and the LG Flex, randomly enough. Meanwhile, it'll work with every iPhone going back to the 4s, along with the fifth-gen iPod touch and every iPad going back to the iPad 3. Technically, all of this is written in fine print on the bottom of the box, and on Garmin's website, though I failed to notice that, and I'm guessing some shoppers will too. So, I was in for a rude awakening when I found that the Vivosmart would not sync with the original Moto X, a device I had purchased only 10 months earlier. What's worse, because the Garmin Connect app was designed to be used with many other Garmin devices (sports watches, for example), I was still able to find the app in the Google Play store and sign in with my existing Garmin account. It wasn't until late in the setup process, when I tried to sync with the phone, that I knew I had a problem. Anyway, let's assume you heed my warning and start off with a compatible device. Once I switched to an old Galaxy S3, I had no problem pairing the two devices and syncing my stats from the Vivosmart to the handset. It's easy to put the band into pairing mode, and you'll receive prompts on your phone when it's time to set up notifications (just say yes, you want to make the Vivosmart a trusted device). Finally, if you're new to Garmin, creating a new account is a cinch; just type in a password and enter a few key details, like your height and weight, and then you're good to go. In use As mentioned, the band has a hidden OLED display, which only lights up when you double-tap it. Even after testing the device for several weeks, there are still times when I don't successfully engage the display on my first try. In any case, once you activate it, just start swiping left to cycle through your various stats, including steps taken, distance traveled and calories burned. What's nice is that Garmin adjusts your daily step goal every day, depending on how active you've been recently. And don't worry, the changes there are always gradual -- one 10-mile run won't have a big an effect on your step target for the next day. In addition to that, Garmin's specialty is something called the Move bar, a line that appears on the screen after you've been inactive for an hour. At that time, you'll feel a gentle vibration on your wrist, with an onscreen instruction to \"move!\" And there the bar will stay until you get up and walk around for at least two minutes. Now, you can always swipe away from the Move bar and look at something else, like the time. Personally, though, I've always found this feature effective. The Move bar might be quiet, but it's insistent. Among the icons you'll see as you're cycling through is a text bubble. That's actually the hub where you'll find all of your notifications, including emails, text messages, missed calls, Facebook posts, Twitter messages, et cetera. If you like, you can go into Garmin's app settings and add even more applications that might not have been set by default (you can disconnect apps at any time too). At this point I should come clean and say I feel ambivalent about the notifications feature. To be fair, that's how I feel about smartwatches in general. On the one hand, there were times when it was enormously useful to be able to look down at my wrist and see an incoming email -- when I was in a movie theater or a meeting, and thought it would be rude to pull out my cellphone. Also, if the email is from someone I'm truly excited to hear from (my best friend, for instance), I often see the message sooner if I'm wearing a smartwatch. On the other hand, you can't read more than a few lines of an email, and you can't delete or archive it when you're done, as you can on an Android Wear watch. The band also buzzes every time I delete a message on another device, as if to alert me that my unread-email count has changed. (Thanks?) Certain kinds of notifications, such as Twitter DMs, are often slow to clear, even after I read them on a different device. And of course, you'll have the same problem as with other smartwatches, which is that the device buzzes regardless of whether you get an email from mom or Groupon; there's no way to filter out the non-important stuff. On the bright side, Garmin took a sensible approach to social networking: The band will buzz if someone writes on your wall or sends you a direct message, but not if someone likes your post, or comments in a group you follow. Luckily, whatever your tolerance, you can turn off notifications at any time by going into the device settings. To that end, just long-press the band if you want to find settings like Bluetooth, manual syncing, battery life, date and time, exercise mode and sleep mode. Additionally, the band has music playback controls, as well as a setting allowing you to ring your phone, in case you're having trouble finding it. Mobile app So far I've mostly been talking about stuff you can do on the band itself. But it's worth taking a look at the Garmin Connect app as well, however crude it may be. I say \"crude\" because it's a little ugly, and also doesn't provide quite as much detail as apps for competing fitness trackers. When you open the app, you'll see various \"widgets,\" or cards for things like calorie burn, step count and sleep quality. Keep in mind that this is the same app Garmin uses with its sports watches, so if you already own a Forerunner, you'll see stats from your various workouts too, along with personal records (fastest 10K, et cetera). What I don't like about the app -- aside from its bland design -- is that you don't get more information at a glance. You have to dig into each individual card to see things like your sleep quality. Speaking of the sort, the sleep tracking here is either inaccurate, primitive, or maybe a little bit of both. Unlike other trackers from companies like Basis and Jawbone, Garmin doesn't give you a sleep score. You can't even tell how much light or REM sleep you got. There is a sleep graph showing your movement throughout the night, but I don't find that particularly helpful -- even if I could tell the difference between a pee break and a little tossing and turning, how would that benefit me? Gallery | 14 Photos Garmin Vivosmart screenshots + See all 14 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Aside from the lack of detail, none of the information stored here is really actionable. Which is to say, while Garmin might track my vitals, it doesn't do anything to help me develop better habits. Whereas Jawbone and Basis allow you to sign up for challenges, with rewards for following through, Garmin doesn't react one way or the other if I exceed or fall short of my step goal. It also doesn't offer any tips for living a healthier life, the way other trackers do. Jawbone, for instance, warned me that if I don't get a good night's sleep, I'm that much likelier to crave carbs the next day; since then, I've been more self-aware about that. To be fair, Garmin's app does have a social component, but because it isn't as popular as, say, Fitbit, you might struggle to find someone you know on your leaderboard. Even then, Garmin doesn't make it easy to find people you know from within the application. With the Vivosmart, then, I felt motivated to meet my step goal, but otherwise never had a reason for collecting all this data. The competition I've already thrown around names like Jawbone, Fitbit and Basis, but it's worth stepping back for a minute and breaking down what each of these competing fitness trackers has to offer. Starting with Jawbone, the company just announced a new flagship tracker, the $180 Up3, which knows when you've started a workout without you entering any special mode. It also provides more detailed sleep analytics than previous models. That said, it's not on sale yet (set to arrive by the end of the year), so if you want something now, you'd have to settle for the $130 Up24. I say, \"settle,\" but that was already one of our favorite fitness trackers, thanks to its stylish design and feature-rich app. In particular, I'm a fan of the software's intuitive UI, helpful wellness tips and smart food logging. Really, with an app that good, Jawbone belongs on your shortlist regardless of which model you get. As for Fitbit, the company spent much of 2014 without a flagship fitness tracker, after recalling the Force due to skin-irritation issues. A shame, since we otherwise liked the Force for its understated design, long battery life and helpful OLED display, similar to the one on the Vivosmart. In any case, Fitbit recently unveiled three new fitness trackers, with the $130 Charge being the direct replacement to the Force. All told, it offers the same feature set and is fairly similar in design except, you know, it shouldn't give anyone a rash. Also like the original Force, it shows incoming calls on the screen, but it's otherwise not a smartwatch the way the Vivosmart is. Because the Charge was just announced, we haven't had a chance to test it, and thus can't vouch for its performance. That said, we are encouraged by some of the improvements Fitbit has made to its app. Whereas food logging was once a sore point, for instance, the food database has gotten quite a bit bigger, and there's finally a bar code scanner too. Hooray! Then there's Basis. You may not have heard of this company, but you should: It was purchased by Intel earlier this year, and it happens to offer the most sophisticated feature set we've seen. Thanks to a bevy of sensors that track movement, sweat output, heat dissipation, blood flow and heart rate, the new $200 Peak band can tell when you're sleeping or exercising without you having to enter a special mode. For that reason, it's the most low-maintenance tracker I've tried yet (full review coming soon). As I said before, too, I also like how the app lets you opt in to challenges, which encourage a healthier lifestyle. Additionally, it adjusts your weekly goals based on your recent activity. The trade-off is that even now that Basis is on its second-gen tracker, it still hasn't gotten the hang of design. In fact, the Peak looks more like a smartwatch than a fitness band, what with its wide band and 1.25-inch touchscreen. That's fine if you like smartwatches, but it doesn't really act like one -- not yet, anyway. The device will eventually use the screen to show you incoming calls, texts, emails and other notifications, but that will come as part of a future software update. Until the Peak gets that update, though, there are actually very few fitness bands that also play the part of a smartwatch. Razer is working on a fitness band called the Nabu that does basically the same thing as the Garmin Vivosmart, but it's not out yet. Microsoft just released a $199 band that displays notifications -- stay tuned for our full review on that. Meanwhile, there are plenty of smartwatches that do a half-assed job of tracking fitness, which is to say they track your steps, distance and calories (but not necessarily your sleep quality). Most new watches also have a heart rate monitor, though in our experience, the tracking there has been less accurate than a dedicated device, or even a more health-centric band. That means right now, there isn't a fitness band that does a fabulous job as a smartwatch, and there definitely isn't a smartwatch that does equally well at fitness tracking. Wrap-up Going into this review, I already knew that Garmin is better at making sports watches than fitness trackers. When I tested the Forerunner 15, a running watch with step-counting thrown in, I came away with the same conclusion as I did here: that the app doesn't offer enough in the way of motivation. In that instance, though, it wasn't a big deal; step counting was just the cherry on top of an already excellent product. But in this case, the Vivosmart is a fitness tracker first, with smartwatch notifications being the cherry-on-top feature. That's a problem, because Garmin's fitness app is not robust enough to carry the experience. Meanwhile, the hardware gets scuffed up easily, and isn't very comfortable to sleep in. Finally, there's the price: At $170 it's 40 bucks pricier than Jawbone's and Fitbit's offerings. And unfortunately, those smartwatch-like notifications aren't useful enough to justify the difference. All that said, I appreciate what Garmin was trying to do here. There's going to soon come a point when wearing both a fitness band and a smartwatch will be an unacceptable compromise. Even now, I'm not sure it's a sensible solution. I'm waiting for a wearable that's stylish, displays notifications and, at the same time, contains all the same sophisticated sensors as the best fitness trackers. The Vivosmart isn't it, but I'm happy to keep waiting. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: fitness, fitness tracker, FitnessTracker, Garmin, garmin vivosmart, garminvivosmart, review, SmartWatch, uk-reviews, Vivosmart \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20987317 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20987317\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/garmin/vivosmart/\"> Garmin Vivosmart </a> Garmin Vivosmart Small Large Buy from $141 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/garmin/vivosmart/\" title=\"Garmin Vivosmart reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 4 </a> Prices Discussions Type Watch-style Tracking metrics Motion / steps, Distance, Calories, Sleep Display Yes Announced 2014-09-04 see all specs \u2192 9.3average user rating Durability 9 Portability 9.5 Ease of use 8 Design and form factor 9.5 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 Displaying prices for model: Small-Black Small-Gray Small-Blue Small-Pink Small-Purple Large-Black Large-Gray Large-Blue Large-Pink Large-Purple $141.50 + tax & shipping Buy now $149.99 + tax & shipping Buy now $149.99 + tax & shipping Buy now $169.99 + tax & shipping Buy now No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

On the surface, it's a small-form gaming PC, custom-built from laptop components to fit in your entertainment center. But it was supposed to be a frontrunner in a new category of gaming devices. It isn't. Valve's Steam Machine initiative was delayed past its original launch window, leaving manufacturers like Dell to fend for themselves in a market that doesn't exist yet. It's a weird, awkward place to be in, but here we are, testing the Alienware Alpha: a Steam Machine before its time. The question is: Can one of the biggest names in PC gaming succeed where others have failed? Gallery | 16 Photos Alienware Alpha review + See all 16 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 73 Alienware Alpha Pros Alpha UI creates a solid console illusion Custom gamepad drivers solve most mouse and keyboard problems Makes it easy to play PC games on a TV Cons Painfully long load times Overprotective console mode blocks some games from running Driver issues can cause trouble with some titles Summary If you absolutely have to have a Steam Machine\u00a0right now, you're not going to do better than the Alienware Alpha. Still, it's a mere stepping stone towards bigger, better and more complete PC game consoles. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware The Alienware Alpha is simple, small and almost boring to look at -- a subdued black box that won't draw an iota of attention to your entrainment center. There's a little flair, of course: The machine's power button is formed in the shape of the signature Alienware logo and one of the machine's front corners is bisected at a sharp angle. An LED glows around the perimeter of the cut. It won't stand out in a bright room, but it's enough to let you know the device is turned on. It's nice. There are only two USB ports lingering on the device's front, but folks hurting for connections can find two more on the machine's back edge and, oddly, an extra USB input hidden behind a panel on the Alpha's undercarriage. The compartment is large enough to conceal most wireless mouse and keyboard dongles (as well as any thumb drive), but sadly, it's far too small to contain the Alpha's included wireless Xbox 360 Controller adapter. The usual assortment of ports fills out the back: HDMI, Ethernet, power and even an optical audio output, though I was surprised to find a second HDMI socket there as well. It's not uncommon for desktop PCs or laptops to have multiple monitor outputs, but what purpose could a dual-monitor setup serve in my entertainment center? None, as it turns out: That's actually an HDMI passthrough input that can be activated through the Alpha's menu system. Basically, it lets you pipe another device in your entertainment center through Alienware's unit to save space on TV inputs. It's not necessary, but it's a nice touch nonetheless. As a game console My heart sank just moments after I first booted up the Alienware Alpha: I wasn't greeted with Steam Big Picture mode or even Alienware's own Alpha interface, but with the Windows 8 profile setup screen. It was shocking; the Alpha may not be an official Steam Machine (at least not yet), but it was meant to be used in the living room as a game console. Did Dell really ship a so-called game console that requires a mouse and keyboard to set up? Thankfully, no: After syncing the included Xbox 360 controller, I found the rig was equipped with basic joystick-to-mouse emulation. Phew. (Dell tells me that retail systems come with a setup manual that explains this from the get-go, but my review unit was bereft of retail packaging.) Stumbling through the Window 8 setup screens with a gamepad-emulated mouse is an imperfect experience, but it's enough to get the job done. Overall, it's actually a clever mouse driver: The A and B buttons reacted as I expected them to, and mimicked the \"select\" and \"cancel\" actions I've learned from the console world. Cursor movement is a bit stiffer, largely flowing in strict horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines. It feels a little unnatural, but it's good enough to get the job done. After setting up Windows, the Alpha will reboot to run the user through its own UI's setup, a process that asked me to set up another password, select my TV's resolution, scale the screen to fit that TV (wonderfully sidestepping my cheap set's overscan issues) and choose between HDMI or optical audio output. After that, things get extremely simple. The Alpha UI primarily exists to act as a buffer between Windows and the average user, limiting the machine's functionality to things that can be managed with the gamepad alone. This makes for a very basic interface; the Alpha UI can launch Steam, dive into a settings menu (used primarily to adjust the settings we just went over or activate the HDMI passthrough), look at a help prompt, restart the Alpha or drop to the Windows desktop. That's about it. As soon as I launched Steam's Big Picture mode, the Alpha UI disappeared behind a flourish of animated menus -- but its work wasn't done. Alienware's software stays active in the background, killing Windows processes, blocking pop-up windows and generally trying to keep the experience congruent with what one expects from a \"game console.\" It does a decent job, too. For the most part, I failed to break the Alpha's console illusion. And when I did? It had a solution for me: the aforementioned mouse emulation. Without hesitation, I can say that the Alpha's built-in mouse emulation is the killer feature here. It's more than a simple thumbstick-to-cursor mapping; it's a small collection of gamepad shortcuts designed specifically to sidestep the problems Windows 8 presents in the living room. Let's say you run into a game launcher that requires cursor control. Simply hold down the gamepad's triggers and shoulder buttons, and depress the left thumbstick -- you're ready to go. Point and click. Did a game launch in a window instead of full screen? Use those same four buttons and press up on the d-pad. Done. Pressing left and right (with the same combo, of course) alt-tabs among active apps and pressing the Xbox Guide button calls up an all-purpose kill menu. It's a simple solution, and it let me fix almost every issue I encountered from the comfort of my couch. In fact, I only needed a keyboard twice: to enter a name in a game's character creation screen and to log into UPlay for Far Cry 4. As impressed as I was by the Alpha's measures to make the PC gaming experience more palatable in the living room, its efforts sometimes backfired. I spent some time in the machine's desktop mode downloading and installing EA's Origin, but when I tried to add the games as non-Steam titles in console mode, I found that they wouldn't launch. This isn't a glitch, Dell tells me; it's intentional. Origin's Windows interface isn't well-suited to life on a television screen, and it's been blocked in console mode to provide a more consistent experience. That sounds logical, but I found the restriction baffling. To even enable the potential \"issue,\" I had to consciously drop to the desktop, install Origin and configure multiple shortcuts. It's not a trivial task, and I have a hard time believing any casual user would accidentally encounter Origin's clunky interface without knowing what they were getting into. This \"Origin issue\" represents an attitude that both serves and harms the Alpha. On the one hand, it shows that the Alpha recognizes that it's a machine straddling two disparate worlds: PC and console gaming. On the other, it fails to integrate those worlds, leaving gamers who live in both frustrated by limitations tailored to only one side of the machine's identity. This \"nanny-console\" dichotomy rears its head elsewhere, too: The machine won't allow the user to activate desktop mode unless they plug in a physical mouse. Again, this seems reasonable, but it's also odd; between the gamepad's mouse emulation and Windows 8's onscreen keyboard, the desktop is completely navigable without traditional peripherals. To be fair to Dell, it has pledged to push out Alpha UI updates every month -- and adding support for Origin in console mode is supposed to be included in one of the first releases. The Alienware team practically admits the product's name is a half-pun: Its software actually is in alpha. It needs expansions and patches, but at least they're on the way. Finally, it's worth noting that the Alpha can't do one thing that traditional game consoles can: handle your media. Alienware's latest box comes with no optical drive and no built-in apps for streaming from any of your favorite services. In console mode, the most you have is Steam's built-in web browser, and that's not good enough. Gameplay If you're okay with the Alpha's PC/console identity crisis, you could probably slide the machine into your entertainment center and have a blast running games at their default settings. It's what I did at first, and I had very little to complain about: Most games ran at a playable clip and looked pretty darn good, too. It was the \"console\" experience and it was fine -- but the Alienware Alpha is (not so) secretly a PC. It can do better, and I had to know how much better. Before I put the Alpha through its paces, I made sure to consider what it was. Yes, it's a gaming PC, but one that has more in common with a laptop than a tricked-out desktop. At the heart of my $549 review unit was a dual-core 2.9GHz Intel Core i3 CPU, 4GB of DDR3L RAM, a 500GB 5,400RPM hard drive and a custom NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPU with 2GB of GDDR5 video memory. That's the base configuration. Dell also offers a $699 version with twice as much HDD space and RAM; a $799 variant with a Core i5 CPU; and a high-end $899 model with a Core i7-4765T and 2TB of storage. What do all those stats add up to in performance? Some pretty decent gameplay, actually. Crysis 3 and The Witcher 2 -- two of the most resource-heavy games in my library -- ran at 31 and 39 fps on high specifications, respectively. Both naturally locked in smoother frame rates with minor concessions. Battlefield 4 netted a tolerable 36 fps on Ultra, and went as high as 41 and 70 on high and medium settings, respectively. The futuristic warzone of Titanfall stuttered a little on maximum settings, but was fully playable on high (34 fps) and medium (42 fps) specs. BioShock Infinite punched in at 64 frames per second at maximum fidelity, too. Looking for something newer? Fine: Far Cry 4 runs at a steady 35 fps on high settings, and sails to 46 fps on medium. Not bad at all. In pure benchmarks, the Alpha did better than I expected, but counting frames only tells half the story. While it's true that most games ran great \"out of the box\" and could often be configured to look a little better, some had problems. Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare both suffered from notable stuttering -- momentary freezes and hangs bad enough to make me give up on playing the latter title altogether. Some games won't run at all: Dragon Age: Inquisition requires the latest NVIDIA drivers to run, but the most recent update isn't yet available for the Alpha's semi-custom GPU. These issues will probably be fixed in a future update, but they're clear growing pains, and they aren't pleasant. The Alpha also bears the weight of egregiously long load times: a possible fault of the machine's slogging 5,400RPM HDD. It's hard to quantify exactly how much waiting the machine imposes on the user, but I can say that it's far too much. Pitted side by side, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare loads levels almost twice as fast on my PlayStation 4 than it does on the Alienware Alpha, and the machine itself takes a full two minutes to start from a cold boot. It's a lot of waiting. If you're comfortable disassembling your gadgets, there's a fix: The Alpha's case is held on by just four screws, and the HDD enclosure is the first thing you see when you crack it open. Stick an SSD or a 7,200RPM hard drive in there and you'll be just fine. Warts aside, it's important to keep perspective on what, exactly, the Alpha is. Yes, technically speaking, it's a gaming PC, but one that has been designed specifically to compete with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It doesn't have to run PC games at their maximum settings to do that: Medium and high configurations on the PC version of a game can often rival the visuals of its console counterparts. What's more, middling graphics configurations on the Alpha can translate to a good-looking game running at 1080p while pushing 60 frames per second or more. That's something most console games can't do. The Alpha doesn't always best its competition (and almost never beats it in load times), but when it does, it's a notable difference. Wrap-up The Alpha does a lot of things right. It's a small, compact gaming PC that fits into your entertainment center. It uses a combination of custom launchers and mouse-emulation to give users an experience analogous to that of a traditional game console with the tools to rescue themselves should its illusion fail. It makes playing PC games on your television gloriously easy, and even gives advanced users the ability to drop down to the desktop and use it as a regular computer. It's also weird, paranoid and overprotective of its console facade. Maybe that's exactly what it needs to be to take on traditional game consoles, but it drove me crazy. Still, I enjoyed my time with the Alienware Alpha -- most of the time, it just worked, and that's exactly what I want from a Steam Machine. Despite my affection for the Alpha, it's still difficult to recommend. If you absolutely have to have a Steam Machine right now, this is the one you want -- but it's a mere stepping stone toward bigger, better and more complete PC game consoles. It's not quite user-friendly enough for the average console gamer, but it's still too limiting and simple to satisfy most PC gamers. If you're somewhere in between, this is the product for you. Otherwise, wait it out. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: alienware, Alienware Alpha, AlienwareAlpha, alpha, dell, review, steam machine, steam machines, steammachine, steammachines, uk-reviews, valve \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21114102 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21114102\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/alienware/alpha/\"> Alienware Alpha </a> Alienware Alpha Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/alienware/alpha/\" title=\"Alienware Alpha reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 4 </a> Prices Discussions Type Gaming Bundled OS Windows (8.1) CPU family Core i3 System RAM 4 Hard drive(s) 500\u00a0(total)Platter Video outputs HDMI Announced 2014-01-06 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Speed and features 8 Design and form factor 10 Expandability 8 Noise 9.5 Size and weight 10 Power consumption 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 7 Who will be playing the Steam Machines? 1 Pricing Details Talk about the Alienware Alpha with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 lab.scriptBs('gravity.js') onBreak({ 0: function(){}, 320: function(){}, 768: function(){} }); ", "title": "Alienware Alpha review: almost the Steam Machine you're looking for"},

Take Samsung's Galaxy Alpha: The name alone exudes confidence. Although the term typically signifies the first in a series, the Alpha obviously isn't Samsung's inaugural Android phone; rather, it ushers in a completely new design direction for the company. It's not a top-of-the-line flagship device on the inside, but what matters is that it actually looks like one on the outside, thanks to its premium aesthetics, metal frame and sleek body. Samsung has every reason to be confident in the Alpha's design. As always, however, there's more to a device than meets the eye.

Unfortunately, it's priced at a premium and doesn't have the same set of features that you can get on the Galaxy S5 for the same price.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware The Galaxy Alpha is the most beautiful Samsung device I've ever handled. It's the very first device to take advantage of the company's brand-new design language, which features polished aluminum sides, chamfered edges, a thin profile and a polycarbonate (plastic) back; the same design is used on the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge (and arguably, the iPhone 5/5s and last year's HTC One), but the Alpha is the first to actually make it off the production line. It's simple, yet elegant; minimal, yet profuse. Featuring a 4.7-inch frame and 6.7mm thickness, the Alpha is more than sufficiently sleek and svelte. Thanks to its slim, compact frame, I had absolutely no problem hanging onto the Alpha. Not only can I wrap my hand around the whole thing, but also its straight sides offer my fingers plenty of space to grip. It's also incredibly light, weighing 4.06 ounces (115g); that's half an ounce lighter than the iPhone 6. In fact, it almost feels like it isn't substantial enough; in my palms, I'm often reminded of a dummy phone -- fake versions of the real thing that manufacturers send to retail stores. I'd be tempted to think of the Galaxy Alpha as a GS5 mini, if the name weren't already taken; in many respects, it's a smaller version of Samsung's current 5.1-inch flagship smartphone. It packs the same Snapdragon 801 chipset (though an Exynos option is also available in certain markets), so it should be similarly powerful, and it also comes with a fingerprint scanner, heart rate monitor and Samsung's TouchWiz UI. But while the Alpha easily beats the GS5 in style (while matching it in oomph), the rest of the spec sheet isn't as impressive. It's not waterproof; it lacks a microSD slot; the battery is smaller; it uses a lower-res camera; and it doesn't come with an IR blaster. It also features a lower-res 720p Super AMOLED display. Since it's not designed to simply be a miniature GS5, these omissions theoretically shouldn't be a big issue. It still packs plenty of a punch, after all, and even the 720p display is considered top-of-the-line for similarly sized devices. (Also, with smaller phones, manufacturers don't have as much space to cram in extra components.) The problem is that you're paying a premium price for the premium look; you can get the Alpha on AT&T in the US for $200 on-contract, or $613 with no contract attached. This is the same on-contract price as the GS5, and only $37 cheaper at full retail. To be fair, AT&T's Galaxy S5 only comes with 16GB internal storage, whereas the Alpha gets 32GB, so that explains some of the difference. Even so, the GS5 at least has a microSD slot for expandable memory. What's even weirder is that while the Alpha doesn't come with any waterproofing or water-resistance of any kind, iFixit did a teardown of the phone and discovered that it comes with many of the gaskets and other internal parts necessary for keeping water out. In other words, Samsung didn't finish what it started. The bottom edge of the device houses a micro-USB 2.0 connector -- Samsung's moved away from the unsightly 3.0 ports that take up extra room -- along with a speaker grille and mic. On the left is a volume rocker, which appears to have received the same amount of attention to design as the rest of the phone. There's a 3.5mm headphone jack on top and a power button on the right. Additionally, the top and bottom of the phone feature a pair of antenna stripes, which are common on metal phones because they provide a place to send and receive cellular and wireless signals. The Alpha also comes with a removable back cover with a textured polycarbonate back that's similar to what you'll find on the Galaxy S5. On the Alpha, however, the dimples are much tinier and the matte surface doesn't feel as slick; the Alpha definitely offers more friction. There's a 12-megapixel camera in the top-center, and since the module is thicker than the phone itself, there's a hump to make the transition between the camera and back cover seem a bit more gradual. (One of my biggest issues with the iPhone 6's design is that the camera abruptly sticks out from the rest of the frame.) The LED flash and heart rate monitor are to the camera's left, arranged in a vertical fashion, and the logos include just the AT&T globe near the top and the phone's name near the bottom. Underneath the back cover, you'll find a removable 1,860mAh battery and nano-SIM slot. The new location of the heart rate monitor works out okay if you hold the phone in your right hand, but it can be troublesome if you prefer your left; the camera hump gets in the way, and I had to keep looking at my finger to make sure it was in the right place. Which brings me to another point: The Galaxy S5's sensor was placed at the bottom of a cavity, while the Alpha's version is nearly flush with the rest of the back. This makes it more difficult to find the sensor without peeking around the phone to make sure I'm actually in the right spot. An aluminum frame comes with trade-offs. Sure, it looks great, feels robust and has an aura of high quality, but as I saw with the iPhone 6, the material isn't immune to blemishes; after just a few days, I started seeing scratches and even a couple dings along the chamfered edges. This means that how it looks after a year of use will depend on how you treat it. If it's constantly rubbing up against other hard materials, it's not going to fare well. As mentioned earlier, the Alpha has a 4.7-inch 720p Super AMOLED panel. On paper, this doesn't sound very good since many new flagships have Quad HD displays. For a handset of its size, however, 720p is still acceptable: The first Moto X was of the same quality. Ditto for the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact, which is one-tenth of an inch smaller. The iPhone 6, meanwhile, is slightly better at 1,334 x 750 (326 pixels per inch). With the Alpha, you'll get a pixel density of 312 ppi, which is still respectable. Of course, the Super AMOLED panel ensures that colors are more saturated than most IPS options, and the viewing angles are simply average and nothing special. If you're looking for a compact phone, the display will neither make nor break the decision for you -- it's perfectly fine, as long as you don't mind some slightly inaccurate colors.

The variance in screen size doesn't impact the user experience, nor does it mean you'll enjoy fewer features. The Alpha uses TouchWiz layered on top of Android 4.4.4 KitKat, which is still technically the latest consumer-facing version of Google's mobile OS (it'll soon be replaced by Android L, but Samsung's lineup should get the new update not too long after it becomes publicly available to the masses). This version of TouchWiz is what you'd expect: It's consistent with every other version of TouchWiz. The UI is exactly the same as on the Galaxy S5, with a vast notification panel, bubbly settings menu and suite of preinstalled Google and Samsung apps. There's also My Magazine, which is a feature that's been on several Galaxy devices over the last two years. (You can also remove it, if you don't want to use it.) It's essentially an extra home screen panel that provides real-time news and social feeds, and looks a lot like Flipboard and HTC's BlinkFeed. Multi Window is also present, so you can still view two apps at once in a split-screen mode, despite having such a small screen. You'll also get Air View, which lets you check out extra details about calendar appointments and larger thumbnails for pictures and videos just by hovering your finger over the display. Lastly, you'll get other common Samsung features like Easy mode, Blocking mode and Private mode (the latter of which hides and secures sensitive information so your random friends won't find it), as well as Smart stay and the ever-present toolbox of customized app shortcuts that continuously floats on top of the screen. Camera The Alpha is thinner than the GS5, which means the camera module isn't quite as large. Instead of a 16-megapixel sensor, you'll get a 12MP shooter on the back with an aperture of f/2.2 and focal length of 4.8mm (the same as on the GS5). So, don't expect a radically different imaging experience here. The user interface hasn't changed, either: Separate shutter buttons for stills and video sit alongside the mode-selection button and gallery link, and settings and shortcuts reside on the opposite sidebar. You get the same default modes here as you do on the GS5 -- the usual Panorama, Dual Camera, Beauty Face and Shot & more modes -- and you can download extra modes, like Animated Photo (add animation to your pictures), Surround Shot (Samsung's version of Photo Sphere), Sports, and Sound & shot (audio accompanies the image). The GS5 gets an extra mode for sequence shots, while the Alpha lets you choose which modes actually show up in your menu -- if you only use one or two, you can get rid of the extra clutter. The settings here are identical as well. HDR, selective focus (in which you can choose to focus on the foreground, background or both), ISO (up to 800), audio zoom and plenty of effects are featured, although there's no way to manually change white balance, exposure or shutter speed. Just like on the GS5, the Alpha has multiple resolution options. Whichever you choose will have an impact on the aspect ratio. If you want the highest resolution possible, you're going to have to settle for 16:9 (widescreen), while the best standard 4:3 shots you can get will come out at eight megapixels. The camera sports Samsung's ISOCELL tech, which I detailed in my GS5 review. In short, it's designed to improve sharpness and deliver better low-light performance and more accurate colors. On the GS5, I noted that performance was indeed better, albeit slightly, and I got nearly the same kind of results from the Alpha. In fact, aside from the difference in resolution (and thus, fewer details and less leeway for digital zoom), the Alpha's images were very similar to ones I took with the flagship. It does well in daylight and produces realistic colors, and is overall a reliable camera, but it's not very good at taking pictures of moving things. I had a difficult time snapping shots of cars or people without blurring. It's also not very good in low-light situations, but this is nothing new for Samsung phones -- the company's struggled with this for a long time, and ISOCELL is designed to make it better. Sadly, there's been no improvement here from the GS5; on the contrary, it's a bit worse. Even when my night shots turned out (I say \"when\" since quite a few were hopelessly dark), they were noisy, lacking in sharpness and not worth sharing with friends or family. I'm not saying it's impossible to get a solid low-light shot, but it's not as easy as it should be. (Click here for a gallery of all my sample shots.) Performance and battery life The US version of the Alpha uses the same Snapdragon 801 chipset as the one found on the GS5, which is comprised of a quad-core 2.5GHz Krait 400 CPU, Adreno 330 GPU and 2GB of RAM. Before I began testing the device, I expected to see the same kind of performance that I've enjoyed on its big brother. Sure enough, I wasn't disappointed: Most apps loaded up quickly, and games like Asphalt 8 and Beach Buggy Racing ran smoothly. I did notice the occasional frame skip, but this was the exception, not the rule. When you look at the benchmarks, it's clear there's very little difference between the two in terms of overall performance. Galaxy Alpha Galaxy S5 Galaxy Note 3 iPhone 6 Quadrant 2.0 24,235 24,714 22,828 N/A Vellamo 3.0 (Multicore) 1,686 1,656 1,994 N/A 3DMark IS Ultimate 13,697 17,954 18,933 16,689 SunSpider 1.0.2 (ms) 788 820 840 351 GFXBench 3.0 1080p Offscreen (fps) 11.8 11.5 10.1 17.4 CF-Bench 32,150 33,351 38,020 N/A SunSpider: Lower scores are better. The Alpha also has a small 1,860mAh battery, which was my primary concern going into the review. Could it handle my everyday demands and still get me through the day? After all, if I can't go a full day without worrying about finding an outlet before I can get home, it's not worth using as my daily driver -- especially when plenty of other devices are up to the task. The Alpha barely makes it to the end of the day with moderate usage; on heavier days when I'm streaming music, reading e-books, taking pictures, staying social and keeping up with nonstop emails, I get around 13 hours. With the Alpha, Samsung included the same fingerprint sensor that it used on the GS5, and it requires the same swipe-down action. Its performance on the flagship was mediocre at best -- it often took me multiple swipes to get the phone to recognize my prints, and was even worse when I tried to do it at an angle. Unfortunately, I only saw minor improvements here, despite the fact that Samsung has had six months to improve the sensor and its integration with software. Admittedly, it's a little better when I swipe from different angles, but it still takes multiple attempts even when my fingers and thumbs are straight on. There's certainly some practice involved, and it does get better over time as you learn the sensor's quirks (you have to do it at a certain speed, and you have to make sure you've covered the sensor with the right parts of your finger). When making phone calls, I had no trouble hearing the other end of the line, but the external speaker didn't fare well. I pitted the Alpha against BoomSound on the HTC One M8, which produced a much louder and fuller audio performance; I could hear more bass and mids on HTC's flagship than I could on the Alpha. The GS5 was also slightly louder, though the difference between the two was marginal -- the audio just wasn't impressive on either Galaxy. Cellular connectivity will vary by market and operator. The AT&T model I reviewed comes with nine-band LTE support (for bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 17 and 29), tri-band HSPA+ (850/1900/2100) and quad-band GSM/EDGE. You'll also get NFC, DLNA, WiFi Direct, Bluetooth 4.0+LE and dual-band 802.11ac support (along with a/b/g/n as well). The competition It wasn't long ago that most phone makers used 4.7-inch screens on their flagships, but now any top-of-the-line phone going smaller than five inches is just unthinkable -- unless, of course, you're Apple. For that reason, it's great to see Samsung come out with a premium-looking device whose specs aren't too far removed from the same-sized iPhone 6, which is available in 16GB for $200 on-contract and $650 off. (If you're looking for extra storage space, the Alpha tops the iPhone at the same price point.) But these two phones aren't the only options in the sub-5-inch space. The Sony Xperia Z3 Compact is a 4.6-inch 720p handset that features many of the same specs as its bigger flagship brother, and actually bests the Alpha in pixel density, battery, camera resolution and external storage capacity. As of this writing, the phone isn't available in the US, so it's only an option for our readers in Europe and Asia -- that is, unless you choose to go through online importers. You'll find that the Z3 Compact is a good deal cheaper than the Alpha: On Expansys, the Z3 Compact goes for \u00a3420 ($530), while the Alpha is available for \u00a3515 ($650). Despite the Alpha's great looks, it's difficult to justify it over the Compact. Wrap-up As beautiful as the Galaxy Alpha may be, its price leads to its ultimate downfall. The only reason you'd want to pick this over the Galaxy S5, which is available for a similar price, is that you prefer a smaller size or more solid build. But even then, this design isn't a one-and-done; you'll be able to get the same fit and finish on the Note 4 and Note Edge (albeit with larger screens). Furthermore, it's not the best sub-5-inch Android device on the market, thanks to the Sony Z3 Compact, which comes with better battery life, camera and external storage. More important is what this new design direction means to Samsung's future. Even though the aluminum build isn't perfect, Samsung's latest smartphones are the best-looking handsets the manufacturer has produced in years. For a company suffering from slowing sales and looking for new ways to compete with the iPhone, devices like the Alpha are essential. This makes it all the more unfortunate that the fantastic design is one of few things that helps it stand out from the crowd. On the upside, though, this is just the beginning; more good-looking Samsung phones are on the way. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: alpha, Galaxy Alpha, galaxyalpha, mobilepostcross, review, samsung, samsunggalaxyalpha, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20967254 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20967254\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/alpha/\"> Samsung Galaxy Alpha </a> Samsung Galaxy Alpha Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/alpha/\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy Alpha reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 3 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android (KitKat [4.4]) Screen size 4.7 inches Internal memory 32 GB Camera 12\u00a0megapixels Carriers (US) AT&T Weight 4.06 oz Released 2014-09-26 see all specs \u2192 8.3average user rating Reception and call quality 8.7 Display 8 Battery life 6.7 Camera 7.3 Ease of use 8.7 Design and form factor 10 Portability (size / weight) 10 Media support 8.7 Durability 8 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 112 How often do you upgrade your phone?

And with the new Moto E, Motorola has crafted one of the most compelling budget smartphones yet. Starting at just $150, it's a tad more expensive than last year's $120 model, but it makes up for that with upgrades that make it a far more usable phone. Those include the addition of LTE, 8GB of built-in storage (twice as much as its predecessor) and a slightly bigger screen. (Moto's also offering a $120 3G-only version.) It may not sound all that exciting if you're waiting for the new Galaxy S6 or HTC One, but it's a solid choice for someone who doesn't need a powerful phone. And it's yet another sign that even the geekiest among us may soon be springing for inexpensive, contract-free phones. Gallery | 12 Photos Moto E review (2015) + See all 12 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 83 Motorola Moto E (2015) Pros Inexpensive Elegant and comfortable design Great battery life Cons Generally slow performance, despite good hardware Mediocre camera Display is difficult to read outdoors Summary Motorola's new Moto E is a solid improvement over its predecessor, with plenty of features for a low price. But it's also easy to see where Motorola had to sacrifice quality to make it inexpensive. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware The Moto E should feel familiar to anyone who's held a Motorola phone since the Moto X debuted in 2013. Even though the company's owner has since shifted from Google to Lenovo, Motorola is still sticking with the same curved-case design, which fits oh so nicely into your hand. Sure, it's still made out of plastic, but for this price I'm not expecting a metal unibody getup. What's truly impressive is that the Moto E doesn't feel like a toy, even though it's one of the most inexpensive smartphones you can buy right now. In 2014 we were amazed that a decently capable smartphone could be cheap. This year, the big takeaway is that it actually has some style to it. The smooth edges from last year's model, which tended to make things a bit slippery, have been replaced by ridges that help quite a bit with grip. In general, the device has a nice, solid feel, largely thanks to the lack of a removable rear panel (read: there isn't much to flex). If you want to get to your SIM card or add more storage, you just have to snap off the phone's plastic perimeter (available in several colors). Motorola's slight screen bump to 4.5 inches, up from 4.3, makes the Moto E feel even snugger in your hand. Even more importantly, the addition of LTE makes it just as capable as more expensive phones when it comes to downloading and streaming media. Unfortunately, its screen resolution is still stuck at a relatively paltry 960 x 540 (qHD). It's once again packing a 5-megapixel camera, but there's now a 0.3 megapixel (VGA!) front-facing shooter as well. That won't be much use for taking quality selfies, but at least you've got the option for video chat now. While most of the Moto E's hardware makes a strong first impression, its display is where you begin to see the sacrifices Motorola made to reach such a low price. It's a decently bright, colorful IPS LCD screen that fares well indoors, but once you step outside it becomes a pain. The smallest amount of sunlight makes it hard to see anything on the screen. (The photo above was taken at its highest brightness on a partially cloudy day.) It's not impossible to use, but it's certainly not user-friendly. You can't blame Motorola too much, though: There simply aren't many inexpensive displays that can take on the sun well. The other problem with the Moto E's screen is its relatively low 960 x 540 resolution, which ends up making text, photos and just about everything else a tad less sharp than on other smartphones. It's not a night-and-day difference from the 1080p displays we're used to today, but it's still a noticeable step down. I came to dread reading long articles on the phone during my subway commute, whereas that was usually the time where I put a dent in my Pocket queue. Maybe that was just an unconscious reaction to the lower specs, but it's still worth noting. If you're stepping down from a more capable display, you'll probably get used to the lower resolution, though. And it probably won't even register to people upgrading from other cheap handsets, or buying their first smartphone. Software No, the Moto E doesn't run stock Android 5.0.2 Lollipop -- but it's close. Sticking with a strategy it's used since the first Moto X, Motorola once again managed to deliver a phone that's mostly free of the crapware that plagues other devices. It packs in apps from Plex, Revision3 and Flixster, but those are things you may actually want to use, so I didn't find them bothersome. The few custom Moto tweaks actually make it more appealing than a totally stock Android phone. There's Moto Display, which lights up notifications on the phone's screen when you pick it up or rock it on a flat surface. Surprisingly, Motorola even brought over the double-twist gesture, which quickly loads the camera when you flick your wrist twice while holding the phone. Just as with the Moto X, that gesture gets you to the camera at any point, including when it's still locked. Those sorts of innovations were one of the key selling points for the original Moto X, which makes it all the more impressive that they're here at all. Camera Just like its screen, the Moto E's so-so camera capabilities won't make you forget that you're using a cheap phone. Its 5-megapixel rear shooter performs fine in daylight and bright indoor scenes, but it's pretty much useless in low light. And no, there's no flash either, if you're into that sort of thing. In decent lighting, the Moto E's camera delivered usable shots, but they were all a bit soft and lacked fine detail. There's also quite a bit of color fringing when the sun creeps into your photos. It's a camera that'll be ideal for quickly throwing photos up on Facebook or Instagram, but it won't give you any high-quality keepsakes. Gallery | 14 Photos Moto E (2015) camera samples + See all 14 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") I didn't spend too much time with last year's Moto E, but there seems to be a slight improvement in overall photo quality when compared to the test shots in our last review. And -- good news! -- you can finally record high-definition video. It's only 720p, but it's something. Once again, Motorola's simplified camera software is the Moto E's saving grace. You can tap anywhere on the screen, or hit one of the volume buttons, to snap a shot. There's no need to aim for a virtual shutter button. Autofocus is just fine (it's sometimes snappier than more expensive smartphones I've tested), and the phone generally manages to take a photo in under a second. But of course, there's no fancy image stabilization here, so the quality of your photos will usually depend on how steady you can hold the Moto E. As for that wrist-flick camera gesture, I was honestly surprised at how well it worked. It typically launched the camera in just a few seconds -- yes, even when the phone was locked -- and it ended up being faster than my iPhone 6 on several occasions. Performance and battery life Moto E (2015) Moto E (2014) Moto G (2014) Moto X (2014) Quadrant 2.0 12,352 5,264 8,846 22,721 Vellamo 3.0 1,929 1,173 1,669 2,093 SunSpider 1.0.2 (ms) 1,368 1,626 1,534 787 CF-Bench 17,483 6,483 14,470 39,018 SunSpider: Lower scores are better; results compiled on Chrome. Acceptable. That's the best way to describe the Moto E's overall performance. Its 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor is fine at accomplishing a single task, like navigating through YouTube and watching videos, scrolling through web pages or browsing through music on Spotify. But once you start asking the phone to do more than one thing at a time -- say, browsing Twitter while Google Play downloads and updates apps in the background -- it becomes an exercise in frustration. Everything takes way too long to load, and it almost feels like you're fighting through a veneer of molasses as you interact with the phone's touchscreen. That's especially surprising since it's packing a gig of RAM. Even when you're not overloading the phone, the Moto E feels considerably slower than most other handsets. There's always a quarter-second delay when you're doing just about anything, be it tapping an app icon, hitting a link in Chrome or making fast gestures with your fingers. But again, this is a $150 phone! A certain amount of slowdown is acceptable for a phone in this price range. And, as with its camera deficiencies, the less discriminating smartphone shopper might not notice the issues. What's most impressive about the Moto E? It's much faster than its predecessor, and in some benchmarks it even bests the new Moto G. That raises some questions, though: Why, exactly, does it feel slower than the revamped Moto G when it has more powerful hardware? My guess is that lower-quality components, like its touchscreen, end up negating the hardware bonuses. Swiping and scrolling on the Moto G's screen feels buttery smooth, whereas the Moto E's screen feels like you're swiping through butter. After using the Moto E for several days, its speed issues bothered me less and less. In fact, it might be the ideal for anyone who feels overwhelmed by the onslaught of digital information we face every day. It forces you to be mindful and methodical about everything you're doing. This may just be the first phone that's best suited for the Zen state of mind. If you haven't mastered your inner calm yet, though, then you might be better off with the Moto G. One benefit of being slightly underpowered? Great battery life. I was typically left with around 25 percent of battery after a full day of use. The Moto E also managed to last around 10.5 hours on our standard battery test, which involves looping a 720p video at half of the screen's brightness until it dies. That's a huge jump over the original Moto E, which hung in there for 5:45. It also lasted more than seven hours across a slew of other battery tests, which involved browsing websites, running a bit of 3D games and playing media. The Moto E's 2,390mAh cell is a solid improvement over the previous model's 1,980mAh capacity, but it's also helped by better energy management in Android Lollipop and the Snapdragon 410 processor. For someone who doesn't use their phone very often, it may end up lasting two days on a charge. The competition Cheapo Android smartphones aren't hard to find, but most of them aren't devices you'd actually want to use. Sharp's $149 AQUOS Crystal is a decent option, but you can only snag it on Sprint or Boost Mobile. There are also plenty of low-end Windows Phones, like the recently announced $70 Lumia 430 and the Lumia 640, but you'd have to forgo Android's richer app ecosystem to use one of those. The Moto E, as an inexpensive phone that proves itself capable with a solid selection of features, is a rare breed. It's a significant step up from last year's model, which didn't even have LTE. The toughest decision with the new Moto E? At $150, it's only slightly less than the $180 Moto G, which has a 5-inch screen, a significantly better camera and a far more responsive interface. I bet the new Moto E's $120 3G variant will end up being far more popular than the LTE version I tested out. Wrap-up If your main concern when choosing a smartphone is price, and you don't want to be locked into a lengthy carrier contract, the Moto E is a good choice. Motorola's done a fine job of bringing its curvy design and technology down to a low price point (though it'll be even more appealing when the LTE version gets a price drop). Even if it's not quite your bag, you can't deny what Motorola has done. Companies like OnePlus and Xiaomi are getting plenty of credit for making cheap phones with high-end hardware, but even those phones would be overkill for less demanding users. Motorola, on the other hand, has taken that idea even further by making the lowest of the low end something you'd actually want to buy. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: lenovo, mobilepostcross, motoe, motoe2015, motorola, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21154517 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21154517\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/moto/e/\"> Motorola Moto E </a> Motorola Moto E US GSM Global GSM Buy from $94 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/moto/e/\" title=\"Motorola Moto E reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 8 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android (KitKat [4.4]) Screen size 4.3 inches Internal memory 4 GB Camera 5\u00a0megapixels Released 2014-05-17 see all specs \u2192 7.5average user rating Reception and call quality 8.9 Display 8.3 Battery life 8.5 Camera 4.8 Ease of use 8 Design and form factor 8 Portability (size / weight) 7.8 Media support 8 Durability 7.7 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 8.3 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 Displaying prices for model: US GSM-Black Global GSM-White Global GSM-Black $94.99 + tax & shipping Buy now 1 any solution for heating problem in moto-e Talk about the Motorola Moto E with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 lab.scriptBs('gravity.js') onBreak({ 0: function(){}, 320: function(){}, 768: function(){} }); ", "title": "Moto E review (2015): The best budget phone gets even better"},

That's why operating system updates can be oddly exciting, and Android's latest upgrade -- known as version 5.0 or Lollipop -- is the firmware equivalent of opening a stack of presents on your birthday. The upcoming release, which is now available on the Nexus 9 and heading to dozens of mobile devices in the coming months, brings a fresh design and no shortage of new features.

It takes a while for manufacturers to look at the new code, determine how to incorporate it into their user experiences -- like Samsung does with TouchWiz and HTC does with Sense -- and then push it through testing and carrier approval. That said, we're already off to a good start: The Nexus 6 and 9 came with Lollipop preinstalled, and updates are also available for the Nexus 4, 5, 7 (2012 and 2013) and 10. Motorola's also rolling out Android 5.0 to the Moto X (2014) Pure Edition and 2014 Moto G (that's for both the US and global variants). You should also expect to see the LG G3 refresh soon, as it's already starting to hit a limited number of markets. Meanwhile, Samsung's higher-end devices are rumored to get Lollipop in December. HTC promises its flagships will have it in less than 90 days from the date it gets its hands on the Android code (so before February 2015) while fans of Sony's Xperia lineup will have to wait until early 2015. If you get the NVIDIA Shield tablet, be on the lookout for Lollipop on November 18th. It's also coming to Google Play Edition devices soon. Of course, this is just a short list summing up what we know so far, so if you don't see your Android device listed, don't freak. Some companies don't reveal their full rollout roadmap right away, so the list of supported devices will expand over time. Material Design If you've been using Android over the past few months, you may have noticed that several Google apps have been updated with a fresh design -- and they all look the same. This is no coincidence: Google's putting its three-year-old \"Holo\" design language out to pasture, moving instead toward a look known as \"Material Design.\" This new aesthetic is featured prominently in Android 5.0 Lollipop, and soon the rest of Google's ecosystem -- desktops, autos, TV and wearables -- will be following suit. If you ask me, this consistency between apps and OS is a good thing, especially since Material Design is cleaner and more colorful than Holo. Google says this kind of cohesiveness breeds visual harmony, and I have to agree: Whether you're using Google apps and services or a third-party option, a universal design language can ease your frustration of not knowing where anything. Since most apps look similar to each other and the rest of Lollipop, it should be less difficult for people to understand what to look for and how to find what they need. All told, the new design language can be split up into three parts: visual, interaction and motion. Let's start with the first. Material Design isn't skeuomorphic, but its inception was based on a concept that is: paper and ink. Using a print-like design with surfaces that appear tactile is easy for our brains to understand. Toolbars act like strips of paper along the top of apps, while cards can come together to form seams and move together as one. Meanwhile, Google creates the illusion of depth by allowing cards, buttons and other elements to be raised over the rest of the page, using shadows and spacing, so it looks like some content is closer to the glass. (The closer it is, the more important that content should be.) Slide a panel out from the side and it slips right over the rest of the app as if you were sliding a piece of paper over another. This use of depth makes it possible to add new elements that direct the user to critical actions. One such concept is a Floating Action Button, a small circular icon raised above the rest of the app meant to catch your attention. It represents a single hallmark action -- compose emails, the play button in a music app, add files to a cloud service -- and is meant to stand out to the user as a signpost for what to do next. Color and typography are also important here. Material Design features a palette of bold and dynamic colors that stick out in the app bar, located on the top of the screen (these bars typically disappear as you scroll down the page). The choices in the palette are designed to give each app a friendly, welcoming vibe that's pleasing to the eye; users are much more likely to jump out of an ugly app than a beautiful one, so first impressions are critical. Similarly, the designers also tweaked the Roboto font by making it rounder and wider, giving the text a more pleasant look. This, along with the colors, icons and layouts used in Material Design, is meant to be positive and optimistic. Material Design is also minimalistic in nature, favoring open space and simplicity as often as possible. As you'll see later in the review, one of Google's main goals in Lollipop was to get rid of unnecessary junk. The stuff you need should be easy to find so you can get in and get out. (Credit: Google) The way you interact with the design is just as important as its layouts and colors. Material Design isn't dull or boring -- on the contrary, it feels alive. When you touch something, it reacts; I never had to worry about whether or not I actually tapped on a button, because I'd see a ripple effect every time I touched it. When I touch and drag a \"hamburger button\" (the stack of three lines used for sidebars and extra menus) out from the corner, it sometimes does a radial turn and morphs into a back arrow; and in cases where I'm rearranging cards or lists, items appear to lift closer to the screen as I move them, as if they're magnetically attracted to my finger. (Credit: Google) The final part of Material Design is motion, which involves the transition from one visual state to another. These animations, Google says, should abide by the laws of physics (scrolling takes a little while to pick up momentum), be well-choreographed (each element in the transition moves in and out of the screen in a coordinated pattern, like top-left to bottom-right) and refrain from hard, jarring cuts back and forth. Each transition should be gradual and subtle, yet not slow down the user experience. Photographs fade in and out of screens like Polaroid pictures and cards and chips open by expanding out from a central point of origin. While many animations can be distracting, most of the ones I used with Material Design are quick and natural enough that I never felt like they were getting in the way or making the process take longer than it normally would. User interface Armed with a basic understanding of Material Design, let's turn to the actual user interface in Lollipop. You'll certainly see elements of the new design language scattered about the setup process (which I'll discuss shortly), but your first impression of the home screen likely won't be too different from what it is now. You still have the same screen of apps and the same status bar, but the Google search bar uses Material Design and is no longer transparent; the soft navigation keys at the bottom now look more like buttons on a PlayStation controller: a sideways triangle for the back button, a circle for home and a square for the new multitasking menu (now known as \"Overview\"). Swiping right still takes you to Google Now, which looks almost the same, except the customization options, reminders and settings no longer live on the bottom of the screen, but rather, an overlay menu accessible by another swipe to the right or by pressing the hamburger button on the top-left. This is just one example of Google cleaning up unnecessary clutter and placing it in a location that's more consistent with the rest of the OS. The app menu is functionally identical, but has a fresh coat of paint to give it more of a Lollipop look. Icons now sit on top of a sheet of digital paper, rather than a transparent background with the wallpaper underneath. What was once a vertically scrolling app-switcher menu is now Overview, a carousel-like list that displays not only your recent apps, but also your Chrome tabs. Instead of going into your browser and having to hunt around for a specific tab, you can now go directly to it in Overview. I can see why this could be convenient to a lot of people, but I actually turned it off in the browser settings after a while for two reasons: First, it gets rid of the tab-switcher button normally found in the top-right corner of Chrome, forcing me instead to go to the app switcher every time. Second, when I have more than a dozen or so tabs open (I often have more than 30!), it means my Overview has a lot more clutter for me to sift through; if I have to scroll through endless thumbnails just to find an app I opened two days ago, it's easier to go into the app launcher and find it the old-fashioned way. But at least Google gives you the ability to choose how you want to use Overview. Notifications and quick settings have been merged into one big menu. This is a cleaner, easier setup than keeping these things separate. When you pull down the status bar, you first see notifications in dark text on a white, paper-like canvas; keep pulling and you'll get to quick settings. (The two-finger pull gesture is still there, however, so you can bypass notifications and go straight to your quick settings if you prefer.) Here, you'll see a slider to adjust brightness, along with toggles for WiFi, Bluetooth, flashlight, rotation preferences, airplane mode and screen casting; date and time show up in their own section along the top, next to battery percentage and buttons for the full settings menu and user modes (more on this soon). And instead of appearing over a black background, the new menus lie over whatever screen you were already working in (that screen dims down bit so it doesn't become visually distracting). I prefer this design because it no longer feels like I'm leaving my current task just to see who emailed a few minutes ago. So much of Lollipop is focused on making things more efficient and streamlining apps. I'll discuss many features that prove this throughout my review, but there's no better example than the new Gmail app, which now comes with support for non-Gmail and Exchange accounts. I was elated about this because I have a Yahoo account and I've always been frustrated that I couldn't just merge the two of them into one single app. Finally, this Material Design-ified app eliminates the need for a separate \"Email\" application. While Google removed a lot of clutter with its Material Design, it also added some in a few places. One such example is Messenger, which is essentially a standalone app that was removed in KitKat. At the time, Google wanted to bundle its messaging in with Hangouts, so you could have your SMS/MMS and online chats together in the same app, but not everyone liked this. In an interview with Ars Technica, Google revealed that carriers weren't happy about the move and wanted a specific app for texting and MMS (of course, a few of those carriers have pushed out their own texting apps anyway). The new app is indeed clean and lovely, but there's one unfortunate side effect: It uses the same name and blue/white color scheme as Facebook Messenger, so the two of them sit next to each other in the app tray. Make sure you separate them out on your home screen so you don't accidentally open up the wrong app. Or you can stick with Hangouts, which still has SMS functionality. The Calendar app's also been given a Material Design makeover, but it comes with a few odd changes. On the phone version, you can't see the entire seven-day week anymore, as the app now opts for a five-day view. To make things worse, you won't be able to zoom in or out of this view, so you're going to have to scroll up and down regardless of what your day looks like. The month view is still technically there, but it drops down from the top of the screen and doesn't have any way to show you which days have appointments like the old one did. (The tablet version gets the standard month and week views, though you still can't zoom in or out.) The agenda view (now called Schedule) may be the most interesting change. Each appointment gets its own colorful card, and certain items in your calendar will get pictures to go along with them: A dentist appointment will show a toothbrush in a glass; a haircut appointment will show scissors; meals like brunch or dinner will feature plates and cutlery. But it goes even further with appointments that you've added an address to -- it shows you a Street View image of what's at that address. It's a clever feature, but I find it a little too visually distracting; I catch myself looking more at the picture than the actual information. Also, if you go into an item that contains lengthy notes -- say, it outlines the agenda for a conference call -- you'll have to do more scrolling now because the cleaner look of Material Design uses more white space and spreads out the text. Point is, the calendar app comes with a fresh look and clever new ideas, but its functionality suffers somewhat. Setup Lollipop turns what was once a frustrating setup experience into a faster, more pleasant one. If you've ever tried to switch from one Android device to another, you've likely noticed that the OS wasn't particularly adept at restoring apps, settings or personal preferences. Now, there's a setup feature called Tap and Go that lets your old phone tell your new one which apps to install, what wallpaper and screen layout you'd like (provided you've been using the Google Now launcher) and other setup information like WiFi, location prefs and more. Every app is still downloaded through the Play Store, so you'll need to re-enter your logins, but at least everything is exactly where you want it. This transfer is done through Bluetooth, but both devices need to have NFC in order to pair with each other. Even if you don't have NFC, not all is lost; you just have to get through a manual restore option. Here, you'll first sign into your Google account, and then choose which of your previous Android devices you want to restore. Then, you select which apps you want to install from that phone or tablet. Sadly, this option doesn't include your home screen layout or wallpaper, so you'll need to rearrange things how you see fit. Either way, both restore options are better than what Android offered before: a hodgepodge process that didn't allow you to pick and choose which apps to restore. This always meant I had to waste time uninstalling several apps that I'd deleted on my older devices long ago. A couple of other things take place behind the scenes as you set up your new device. One of the first things the phone or tablet does once it gets connected through WiFi or cellular is search for updates; Lollipop has an OTA function built into the setup process itself, in case it needs to push quick system updates or any other emergency fixes as early as possible. One of the quietest additions to Android in Lollipop addresses one of the biggest shortcomings in the platform: preloaded carrier bloatware. The feature, called Play Auto Installs, makes it possible to uninstall apps that mobile operators like Verizon and AT&T require on their devices. During setup, when the system detects a carrier SIM has been inserted, it automatically downloads apps from that carrier. (Before, those apps were already preinstalled on the phone.) This move makes those apps part of Google Play, which means they can easily be uninstalled at any time. Notifications and Interruptions The notifications menu has mostly changed in design, not function, but that's only a small part of the story. In reality, Lollipop fundamentally enhances the way we interact with Android notifications entirely. A key goal in Android 5.0 is to eliminate (or at least lessen) distractions to our daily workflow and make multitasking more efficient, and improving notifications goes a long way toward satisfying that goal. When you receive a call, you no longer have a new screen suddenly popping up in place of what you're currently doing; now it appears as a heads-up notification (a banner) on the top of the screen with the option of answering or ignoring the call. Messages, alarms and low-battery alerts will also appear the same way, as well as other notifications deemed a priority. Notifications also now appear on the lock screen. These pop-up alerts have been on iOS for years, and although previous versions of Android made it possible to access the notification panel from the lock screen (if you chose not to lock your device), it was still an extra, unnecessary step. The new notifications are also actionable: When you get a new email, you can delete it without leaving the lock screen or you can hit reply and go directly into an email compose screen. (As an aside, lock screen widgets have disappeared. I rarely use them, but I know a few people who'll be sad to see them go.) But a lot of people don't want sensitive details to just pop up on their lock screen; there's nothing worse than getting an inappropriate text from a friend when your phone's sitting on a conference room table for all to see. So Android now comes with an option to shield notification details when your phone's locked, so you only see that a new message or email is waiting for you. (You can also choose not to have any pop-up notifications at all when the phone is locked.) And what about those annoying notifications for all of those apps you just don't care about? (I'm looking at you, Asphalt 8.) Before, you had to go into that app's settings and opt out of receiving notifications, but now it's all built into the system settings; you're presented with a list of apps, and when you open each one, there's an option to block the notifications entirely. It would be even better to have a checklist in which you could easily check off the apps you wanted to block, but this is a step in the right direction. Besides, the reason you can't just check off a full list of apps is because blocking is not the only option in that menu: You can also prioritize the app so that its notifications rise to the top of your list, and gets whitelisted so you still receive them when you're in Do Not Disturb. Except Google doesn't call it Do Not Disturb. In Lollipop, it's known as \"Interruptions\" and it's yet another fantastic feature. Nearly every other mobile platform has this feature, so Google is hardly the first to the scene; there have even been plenty of third-party and manufacturer options available on Android as well. Now it's finally baked into the OS, and comes with a few nice touches. All the usual Do Not Disturb options are here: You can set a recurring schedule and decide whether to allow calls from everyone, anyone on your contact list or starred contacts. It also gives you the option to silence calls, messages and events/reminders (or any combination of the three). This is a wonderful feature, though I'd like to see Android support multiple schedules; many people go to sleep and wake up at different times on different days, so I should be able to set 10 PM to 7 AM on Sunday and 1 AM to 9 AM on Tuesday if I want to. (Apparently I like to party hard on Monday nights.) Now, about those nice touches. When you adjust the volume on your device, you'll notice options for \"none,\" \"priority\" and \"all.\" This indicates the type of interruptions you want to allow: If you're going into a meeting, for instance, you can select \"none\" to get absolutely no notifications or \"priority\" to only get calls or messages from those people of your choosing. And when you select either setting, you'll be asked how long you want to stay in that mode, so it'll automatically revert back to normal at a set time. Lock screen I touched on lock screen notifications in the last section, but didn't discuss the actual lock screen itself. It may take a little getting used to because, in many ways, it seems to contradict the simplicity and visual cues in other parts of Material Design. On stock KitKat, you could swipe from the bottom-center in any direction to unlock the screen; on Lollipop, you swipe up from an icon on the very bottom. Accessing the camera and phone dialer are also confusing actions: The camera icon is still in the bottom-right corner of the lock screen, but you have to swipe left horizontally. In other words, directly across the bottom of the screen -- to open it. (Vice versa with the dialer, which sits in the bottom-left corner.) Each time I opened the camera, I naturally tried to swipe diagonally up from the corner, only to find myself on the home screen. Equally confusing is what happens when you swipe down on the notifications. A gentle tug down on a specific card will let you peek at additional details, but it shrinks back to normal if you let go. Keep tugging and the clock will disappear as the full notification list takes up the entire screen; cards that had been kept hidden by default will now show up, and there's a button at the bottom that lets you clear everything out of the way. The swipe-down action is fine once you get used to it, but it's a bit jarring at first because there's no indication that you can even do it. If it's your first time using Lollipop, you may not even realize it's there. Also, it appears that lock screen widgets didn't make it into Lollipop. I rarely used them in previous versions of Android, but it's something you'll need to take into consideration if it was a key part of your workflow. Performance enhancements It wasn't a problem on the Nexus 5, but non-Nexus devices running KitKat (excepting the Moto X, of course) couldn't use \"OK Google\" voice activation, which lets you dictate commands to your phone hands-free. Lollipop is taking the feature one step further by letting you do it when the screen is turned off and the phone is locked. Technically, Google says that any phone with a capable digital signal processor should be able to take advantage of the functionality now; unlike the new Moto X, however, you're still unable to use your own hotwords to activate the device. There are quite a few other features embedded into the OS that will improve the performance of your Android device. First, Lollipop is optimized to support 64-bit apps and architecture (such as some versions of ARM, x86 and MIPS). While this won't make much of a difference to you if your phone doesn't have the hardware to support it -- the Nexus 9 comes with a 64-bit chipset, while the Nexus 6 does not -- it's going to become increasingly important as more apps and more phones become compatible with it. Google says the native Android apps (Gmail, Calendar, etc.) now have 64-bit, as well as pure Java language apps. Not that this is going to mean a whole lot at first; it's going to take a while for the development community to switch gears and code their apps with this support. And as is widely reported, one benefit of this next-gen computing is the higher ceiling of device memory so you can fit more than 4GB of RAM in phones and tablets; that's still a ways out, so it seems pointless right now to make a fuss about 64-bit since no mobile device even comes with that much memory, but when they do, Android will be ready for it. However, there's more to 64-bit support than that. For one, it increases the amount of data that chips can process per cycle, and it's inspiring chipset makers (like NVIDIA and Qualcomm) to not only upgrade their silicon to the higher capacity, but also find new ways to make these chips more powerful and energy-efficient. In other words, the 64-bit support is great news, but it's just one piece of the puzzle. Even if you aren't enjoying a 64-bit chip, you'll still see an increase in overall performance through the new Android Runtime (ART). In short, the runtime is what Android uses to convert developer code into an actual running app, and until now, this was done through an older option called Dalvik. ART could be accessed in KitKat in test form, but it's now the default in Lollipop, and Google says it's made it even more advanced this time around. By switching to ART, Google promises a four-fold increase in performance: Apps will run faster and more responsively and they'll conserve more battery, although the programs will take up a little extra space on your mobile device. The power efficiency of the Android Runtime is just one part of Google's latest project, known as Volta. Since Jelly Bean, the Android team has done a project on each version of the OS to address specific points of weakness and improve the user experience; Project Butter worked on making the system smoother, while Project Svelte made the OS more pleasant on low-powered devices. Project Volta is Lollipop's big fix, and focuses on increasing battery life. The Volta team spent a lot of time analyzing what makes the device's battery drain (and why) and cleaned up many of the inefficiencies that affect different areas of the system. The solution was to bundle bland, behind-the-scenes activities together, tell the device not to wake up for a routine network task if you're not actually connected to anything and throw in some new battery stat trackers. It also includes a battery saver feature akin to what's found on Samsung and HTC devices, in which it cuts off a lot of activities, data and performance when the device gets down to 15 percent. And when you've plugged your phone or tablet in, it'll tell you how much time it will take to reach a full charge. Lollipop also comes with OpenGL 3.1 and an Android extension pack, both of which bring more functionality for advanced 3D graphics. This means you'll get games with a new set of visual effects and bring your phones and tablets closer to a console-quality experience. Security With each new release of Android, Google adds more security features to its mobile OS. Many of them might seem insignificant because they're meant to be backend enhancements, which are added to keep the system at least one step ahead of malicious attackers. Lollipop comes with plenty of these behind-the-scenes patches as well; one of them is SELinux Enforcing mode, which continuously monitors the system and apps to ensure nothing's wrong on your device. Your Lollipop phone or tablet is also automatically encrypted by default (on new devices, at least; if you have an existing device, like a Nexus 5 or 7, you'll need to tell it to encrypt). However, these kinds of features are accompanied by a few clever user-facing features that I found incredibly useful. The first is Smart Lock, which lets a trusted Bluetooth device -- smartwatch, earpiece, speaker system and so on -- act as a form of authentication. When the phone and accessory are within range of each other (roughly 30 feet, or 10 meters), you won't need to put in your password or PIN code to unlock your phone. If you're already on the fence about buying a smartwatch, something like this is certainly a good reason for getting one. Lollipop also comes with Guest mode for phones and tablets, so if for some reason your friend wants to use your device, they can do so without being able to see your personal information. In addition, phones also have multi-user support, something that, until now, was only available on tablets. As an admin, you can disable phone calls and messages for other users -- especially helpful when you're handing off the device to your kids -- and even delete their accounts. (Curiously, you can only have restricted profiles on Lollipop tablets, and there's no way to manage or delete apps installed by other users.) Although each user can manage their own space, download their own apps and even lock their profile with a password, the settings you change will also affect everyone else; if you connect to a WiFi network, you'll stay connected to it even when you switch users. What if you're not comfortable letting your kids have their own user account on your device (or perhaps they're too young)? Now you can pin (or lock) apps so that the user can't get out. This way, you can let them play games and not have to worry about them calling your boss or deleting half of your inbox. Once you're in the app you want to pin, go to the Overview and you'll find a pin button floating above your current app. (To get out, you just need to press and hold the back and Overview soft keys at the same time.) After three years of virtually no improvements, Face Unlock is getting its first major face-lift. It's also changed its name to Trusted Face and is meant to resolve some of the issues originally brought up when the feature debuted on Ice Cream Sandwich. Previously, you had to wait for the phone to recognize you before you could view anything. With Trusted Face, the camera will look for your face as you read your notifications, so it's ready to go by the time you swipe up to unlock the device. But how can you tell the feature did its job? It's difficult to see an indicator of success at first, but look closely enough at the icon at the bottom of the lock screen, which changes as soon as the device recognizes your face. If it doesn't recognize you, swipe up to type in your PIN code and you're in. Miscellaneous Android 5.0 introduces RAW image support when taking pictures. This format offers the full, uncompressed version of each shot you take, rather than scrunching it down into a bite-sized JPEG. It mainly comes in handy when you want to manipulate the shot in Photoshop or Lightroom. Because of this, it's more useful for professional photographers or enthusiasts (especially since each image takes up at least 15MB, so you can find yourself quickly running out of storage space on your device). It's also not available natively, so you'll need to wait for a developer to create an app that enables this function. No such app is available on the Play Store yet, but I found an open source Android app called L Camera, which can be downloaded via the web. There's also built-in USB audio support, so devices running Lollipop should be able to use professional audio equipment like microphones, speakers, amplifiers, mixers and so on. (A few devices already came with this feature, but it wasn't natively built into KitKat.) This addition doesn't sound like a critical feature for the average user, but it's huge news for artists whose best option for recording on mobile devices has been iOS. This may also indicate that we'll eventually see manufacturers abandon the 3.5mm headphone jack and begin using USB headphones, as Apple is rumored to be considering as well. Another point of contention for many artists and producers is Android's audio latency, which affects their ability to process music in real time; Lollipop boasts a reduction in latency, so developers can now make apps to take advantage of this enhancement. Finally, there's support for mixing up to eight channels, including 5.1 and 7.1. Lastly and certainly least, Google's latest Android Easter egg is... a Flappy Bird clone. No, really! Hold down the color-changing lollipop and you turn into a small Android robot trying to navigate its way through a series of lollipops. Strangely enough, it's actually much more difficult than the game that inspired it; my high score was 6, and even that took a few minutes of solid effort to achieve. (Don't judge me.) Wrap-up It's hard not to be impressed by Google's efforts in building Android 5.0. It not only introduced a completely new design, but it also managed to squeeze in a boatload of great features that improve the Android experience. Lollipop brings more intuitive notifications, improvements to performance and battery life, clever security features and developer tools for better apps. It's one of the biggest upgrades Android has seen yet, and it's definitely worth making the jump when your device eventually gets it. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android5, android5.0, androidlollipop, firmwareupdate, google, impressions, lollipop, mobilepostcross, preview, uk-feature \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20986380 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20986380\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android/50/\"> Google Android 5.0 </a> Google Android 5.0 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android/50/\" title=\"Google Android 5.0 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 7 </a> Prices Discussions Announced 2014-06-25 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Ease of use 9.1 Speed 9.1 Configurability 9.1 Ecosystem (apps, drivers, etc.) 8.9 Openness 8.9 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 137 I can't believe Android or iOS still don't have _______! 4 Moto X (2014) vs. Sony Xperia Z3 compact 0 your predictions about Samsung Note Edge release date and price Talk about the Google Android 5.0 with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 lab.scriptBs('gravity.js') onBreak({ 0: function(){}, 320: function(){}, 768: function(){} }); ", "title": "Android 5.0 Lollipop review: Google's biggest mobile update in years"},
{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/12/15/chromebook-2-review-11-inch-intel/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "December 15th 2014 at 4:05 pm", "body": " Just what the world needed, right? Another Chromebook. And yet, here I am, reviewing my sixth one in about as many months. Still, there's a reason I'm testing Samsung's newest model, the 11-inch Chromebook 2. It's because it replaces what for the longest time was our favorite Chromebook -- the one Samsung released all the way back in 2012. This new edition costs the same, at $250, but it's purportedly better in almost every way: The battery life is longer; the design is nicer; and the performance should be stronger, thanks to a new Intel Celeron processor. As we know, though, two years is a long time, and indeed, Samsung now has much more competition than it used to. For $250, you could get Sammy's new entry-level Chromebook, or you could also go with models from Acer, ASUS and HP, just to name a few. Is Samsung's still the best after all these years? Gallery | 43 Photos Samsung Chromebook 2 review (11-inch, late 2014) + See all 43 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 78 Samsung Chromebook 2 (11-inch, late 2014) Pros Stylish design, relatively thin and light Comfortable keyboard and trackpad Decent battery life Fast 802.11ac WiFi Cons Lack of a full-sized SD card reader will be a disappointment to some shoppers Display offers limited viewing angles Other Chromebooks offer twice as much RAM Summary Samsung's entry-level Chromebook isn't perfect, what with its washed-out display, limited RAM and lack of a full-sized SD slot. Despite those shortcomings, though, it's still a solid choice, thanks to its premium design, comfortable keyboard and long battery life. So, while shoppers have plenty of good options at this price, you can't go wrong with what Samsung has to offer. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware This might be Samsung's lowest-end Chromebook, but you wouldn't know it from looking at it. The unit we have here has the same design as the higher-end 11- and 13-inch models, complete with a silver, faux-leather lid and fake \"stitches\" along the perimeter to make it look more like the real thing. The truth is, you'd never actually mistake this for real leather, but it's nonetheless an effective design choice: Although the lid is really just plastic, it looks far more premium than your typical plain-Jane Chromebook. Make no mistake, though: I don't recommend Samsung's Chromebooks purely for aesthetic reasons. I also really appreciate the company's approach to keyboards. Considering this is a relatively thin, 0.66-inch-thick machine, its keys are actually relatively cushy. Ditto for the 13-inch version; that model has springy buttons too. In any case, this is great news for anyone who expects to spend a lot of time in Gmail and Google Drive, and it's definitely something you'll want to keep in mind as you're comparison shopping: Most other Chromebooks I've tested have flatter, shallower keys. As a bonus, the touchpad also works smoothly -- no issues at all with single-finger tracking. The display is also nice enough, though hardly noteworthy. Whereas the 13-inch model has a full HD, 1080p screen, the 11-incher I'm reviewing here tops out at 1,366 x 768. That's standard resolution for a laptop this size and price; I wouldn't have expected any better. The quality is also average -- a 200-nit, matte-finish panel that does a good job reflecting glare, but doesn't provide especially wide viewing angles. All in all, then, a pretty mediocre display, but it is worth noting that this is the same screen used on Samsung's other 11-inch Chromebook, which currently sells for $50 more. So, if you're looking at the two variants on the company's website and aren't sure which to pick, that's something to keep in mind: For $300, you're getting the same exact viewing experience that you would for $250. Taking a tour of the rest of the machine, you'll find that the port selection matches what you'll get on competing Chromebooks -- mostly, anyway. On board, we have two USB ports (one 3.0, one 2.0), an HDMI socket and a combination headphone/mic jack. The one difference is that Samsung still uses a microSD slot to augment the 16GB of built-in storage -- not a full-sized one. If you just intend to load up your card with music and videos and then keep it in the machine, it doesn't matter so much what the format is. But, if you happen to shoot photos with a standalone camera, you might be disappointed by the fact that you can't just remove your full-sized SD card and stick it inside the laptop. Finally, if you flip the notebook over, you'll find a pair of two-watt speakers on the bottom side, which produce reasonably loud sound. I mean, let's be clear, if you want really good audio, you should look at the Toshiba Chromebook 2 instead. But the sound quality here is still good enough for streaming Spotify while you work.

For the most part, the words \"Intel\" and \"Chromebook\" are synonymous: Almost every model we've tested uses an Intel processor. In many cases, it's the same exact Intel processor, which makes evaluating Chromebook performance a tricky and sometimes boring process. Samsung's different, though. With the exception of its very first model, which came out three years ago, the company has mostly been using its own ARM-based chips -- and still does, on its higher-end machines. With its latest model, however, even Sammy is jumping aboard the Intel bandwagon: The new Chromebook 2 features a Celeron N2840 chip, the same one used in the Toshiba Chromebook 2. Like many of its competitors, it makes do with 2GB of RAM, though it's worth noting that Samsung's higher-end 11-inch Chromebook 2 has 4GB of memory. At any rate, having just two gigs of RAM doesn't seem to have hurt the Chromebook 2's performance very much. It manages to beat or basically match the Toshiba Chromebook 2 in every test, despite the fact that the Toshiba unit we tested had 4GB of memory to work with. For the most part, its scores also fall in line with most other Celeron-based Chromebooks; in the case of Mozilla's Kraken JavaScript test, it actually comes out ahead. All of which is to say, the new Samsung Chromebook 2 is zippy enough for basic use: things like email, web surfing and Netflix streaming. As with competing models, boot-up takes less than 10 seconds, and a new 802.11ac radio (as opposed to the older 802.11n standard) ensures a fast, reliable WiFi connection. And even after hours of Netflix streaming, it still stayed cool enough that I could comfortably rest it on my lap. That said, the fact that this has the same or a similar processor as some other machines means it also runs into some of the same performance pitfalls. When using Spotify's web player, for instance, I more than once noticed the audio cut out briefly when I opened a new tab, or even switched tabs. The last time I experienced that? When I was testing the Toshiba Chromebook 2, another machine that uses Intel's N2840 chip. Battery life Samsung Chromebook 2 (11-inch, Intel) 7:00 (full HD) / 9:48 (standard def) ASUS C200 11:19 (standard def) Acer Chromebook 13 10:07 (standard def) Dell Chromebook 11 7:30 (full HD) / 8:37 (standard def) Samsung Chromebook 2 (13-inch) 8:22 (standard def) HP Stream 11 8:17 (full HD) / 8:45 (standard def) Lenovo N20p 7:55 (full HD) / 8:58 (standard def) Toshiba Chromebook 7:01 (full HD) / 8:15 (standard def) Toshiba Chromebook 2 6:34 (full HD) / 7:31 (standard def) Acer C720 Chromebook (Intel Core i3) 6:27 (full HD) / 7:53 (standard def) Acer C720 Chromebook (Intel Celeron) 5:57 (full HD) / 7:49 (standard def) Samsung Chromebook (2012) 6:33 (standard def) HP Chromebook 11 5:08 (standard def) According to Samsung, the Chromebook 2's two-cell, 30Wh battery can last up to nine hours on a charge. That's a slight improvement over the higher-end, $300 model, which also has a 30Wh, 4,080mAh battery. In any case, my mileage varied quite a bit depending on my exact usage, as I expect it will for you too. In our usual video-looping test, I got seven hours of full HD playback, putting it on par with other machines that use the same processor, like the Toshiba Chromebook 2. When I ran the test again, though, this time with a lower-res standard-def video, the battery life climbed to nine hours and 48 minutes. Again, your mileage will vary, but I think it's safe to say that battery life here is as good if not slightly better than most other 11-inch Chromebooks. Well, with one major exception, anyway. Software On the one hand, I don't feel like I need to explain to you how Chrome OS works -- it's basically just the Chrome browser with an app launcher and a stripped-down \"desktop,\" for lack of a better word. On the other hand, my conversations with readers and even my own family suggest that a lot of people still have misconceptions about how Chromebooks work. Namely, the idea that you have to be online all the time to use them. Now it's true, when the first Chrome OS devices came out three years ago, you did indeed need an internet connection for them to be remotely useful. But over time, Google has made more and more of its services usable offline, including Gmail, Drive and, as of a few months ago, Play Movies & TV. There's also an area of the Chrome Web Store just for offline-capable apps, so there shouldn't be any confusion as to what requires an internet connection and what doesn't. Besides that, the only other thing you need to know is that every Chromebook (not just this one), comes with 100GB of Google Drive storage, free for two years. Pretty standard stuff. Configuration options Before I start comparing the new Chromebook 2 to everything else on the market, it's worth breaking down how it compares to the other two Chromebooks in Samsung's lineup. I suspect you're not cross-shopping this with the 13-inch model, which is obviously larger, and is also considerably more expensive ($350, versus $250 for the version I'm reviewing today). That said, you might be considering Samsung's other 11-inch Chromebook 2, which starts at $300 and has the same 1,366 x 768 screen, faux-leather lid and 2.65-pound chassis. The only real difference is that the $300 model has a Samsung-made, eight-core chip inside and 4GB of RAM, as opposed to a dual-core Intel N2840 processor and 2GB of memory in the $250 version. The message Samsung seems to be sending is that the performance on the higher-end model is strong enough that it's worth 50 dollars over the entry-level one. I'm dubious of that. The more I use Chromebooks, the more I'm convinced that performance across the board is generally good enough -- I've yet to find one that's unusable. What's more, even when you do squeeze in a more powerful processor -- like this Core i3 chip, for example -- the performance gains are modest at best, and sometimes come at the expense of battery life. If you're gonna go Samsung, I'd either buy this, or spring for the 13-inch model with the 1080p screen. The competition Not that you have to stick with Samsung. Almost every major PC maker has at least one 11-inch Chromebook for sale, many of them in the same price range. ASUS' C200 also costs $250, and comes with 16GB of local storage. As I alluded to earlier, it's a battery life champ: It can play back more than 11 hours of standard-def video, whereas other machines struggle to crack nine. It's also slightly lighter than the Samsung Chromebook 2, at 2.5 pounds. Still, that long battery life is offset by sluggish performance, including longer-than-usual boot-up and sign-out times, as well as everyday hiccups, including delays when deleting messages in Gmail or loading new tweets on Twitter.com. Again, though, I've yet to come across a Chromebook that's downright unusable. This one's usable; it's just slower than some of the others. In a similar vein, HP's Chromebook 11 has received a price cut, and is now around $250 at Amazon. Meanwhile, Acer has something even cheaper: the 11-inch C720 Chromebook, which starts at $200. For the money, the design is plainer than the Samsung Chromebook 2 and the battery life is shorter. I'm also less of a fan of its keyboard, which is flatter in comparison. All told, it's a good deal for the money, but I can see why you'd spend an extra $50 for longer battery life and a comfier keyboard. There are other choices too, but they're more expensive. Dell's Chromebook 11, for instance, still starts at $300. Lenovo's N20p starts at $330, mostly because it has a touchscreen that bends partially back into different viewing modes. Finally wrapping up, some of you will want to take a look across the aisle at what Windows machines have to offer. The HP Stream 11, for instance, is a $200 laptop running full Windows 8.1 with a comfortable keyboard, eight-hour battery and surprisingly good audio. The performance trails Chromebooks a bit, especially on boot-up times, but it could be a fair trade-off for people who want the option of running traditional desktop apps. On that note, you might also like the $199 ASUS EeeBook X205 and the $200 Acer Aspire ES1, though we admittedly haven't had a chance to test those, so we can't vouch for things like performance, battery life and keyboard quality. Wrap-up I wouldn't say the new Samsung Chromebook 2 is the best Chrome OS device you can buy, but that's mostly because it's just one of several good options at this price. In particular, it has a more premium design than its rivals, along with a comfortable keyboard and trackpad, relatively long battery life and fast 802.11ac WiFi -- something you won't find on some older models that are still being sold. On the other hand, it's one of the only Chromebooks I know of that doesn't have a full-sized SD card slot, and it has some of the same performance hiccups as other Celeron-based laptops I've tested. All in all then, it's mostly on par with other 11-inch Chromebooks, which is to say it's imperfect, but still a good deal.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/03/blackphone-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "October 3rd 2014 at 3:00 pm", "body": " Whether it's government agencies, identity thieves, opportunistic hackers or marketers, everyone wants your personal data. As we live more of our lives than ever online, we're increasingly aware of how much data we produce, and the need to protect it. With smartphones playing a key role in our always-connected lifestyle, there's a new breed of services and devices for consumers who want to stay off the grid without going offline. Leading the charge is the Blackphone, a $629 handset that prioritizes privacy over everything else. Running a custom, secure version of Android and shipping with a wealth of privacy tools preinstalled, it claims to be an \"unparalleled product\" where data protection is concerned. Thanks to the awesome folks at online retailer GSM Nation, who were kind enough to send one for review, I've been getting to know the device and finding out how it keeps data safe from prying eyes. Gallery | 23 Photos Blackphone review + See all 23 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 78 SGP Technologies Blackphone Pros Super secure OS Bundled with various privacy-focused apps Includes subscriptions to several encrypted services Capable pair of cameras Cons Expensive Generic design Spotty performance and app compatibility Bundled subscriptions expire in a year Emphasis on security trumps convenient user experience Summary From a hardware perspective, the Blackphone is nothing to write home about, especially when you consider the $629 price tag. What you're really paying for, however, is a security-driven OS, complete with apps and one-year subscriptions to services that promise the same level of data privacy. And in that respect, the Blackphone is simply incomparable to anything else out there.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware The Blackphone is billed as a security- and privacy-first device, not one with a record-breaking spec sheet or award-winning design. It shouldn't come as much of surprise, then, that its creators haven't invested in making the phone visually desirable. A company called SGP Technologies officially makes the Blackphone, but it is, in fact, a joint venture of encrypted-comms specialist Silent Circle and Spanish handset-maker GeeksPhone. While the latter's creations tend to prioritize function over form, none have looked quite as generic as the Blackphone, which could've easily come from any OEM competent in making squares with rounded corners. And the reality is that's exactly where it came from: The Wax from French company Wiko is essentially the same phone, albeit with a slightly lower-clocked processor and less internal storage. There's no prize for guessing what color options the Blackphone comes in, because there's only one. A mixture of different types of black plastic make up the entire body of the phone, with a matte-effect back panel hiding the removable battery and microSD/micro-SIM slots. The outer rim of the device is clad in a deeper, almost shiny plastic dashed with silvery flecks throughout. The same material is used to cap off the lower end of the device -- a design flourish reminiscent of some older Sony phones. The Blackphone is laid out in pretty standard fashion. On the top edge, you'll find the micro-USB port and headphone jack; on the bottom rim is the primary mic; and over on the right are the power button and volume rocker. Up front is a 4.7-inch display, with the earpiece, a multicolor notification LED and front-facing camera above. Below the screen are three backlit capacitive keys in the normal Android arrangement. Moving around to the backside, everything runs down a central column. From the bottom up, we have: a small loudspeaker grille and white Blackphone logo; a secondary mic; the main camera; and an oblong companion flash. The camera protrudes from the back by about 2mm, meaning it comes in contact with surfaces when the phone is lying face-up. While there's a ring of metal around the lens, it's not elevated and thus won't stop an abrasive surface from having its way with the glass cover. Considering the Blackphone only sports a 4.7-inch display, its dimensions are quite... healthy, at approximately 141 x 69 x 9mm (not counting the camera bulge). That means there's a decent amount of bezel framing the screen, but not enough to appear outside of normal proportions. More importantly, the Blackphone is comfortable to hold and use one-handed. An agreeable width takes some credit, but then there are the rounded corners that sit nicely in the palm, and the slight curvature to the back panel as it meets the edge of the device. The matte plastic of the battery cover also adds some grip, which helps with single-handed operation. At 119g (4.2 ounces), the handset is extremely light. That's great for when you're carrying the phone around in your pocket all day, but it also reminds you this is basically an all-plastic affair. Don't get me wrong, everything is put together with a relatively high level of care, but I wouldn't call the build quality robust when you can bend and flex the thing easily. Then there are little lapses the QA department has obviously let slide, like the back panel not fitting snugly at the top edge, or the glass covering the camera lens glued slightly off-center. So, the Blackphone doesn't look special, but the generic design almost complements the discreet nature of the device. It's unlikely to attract the attention of an opportunistic thief scoping out tables at the local bar, for example. I doubt creating a furtive device was a conscious choice, though, and more the result of trying to keep hardware costs down. People are interested in the Blackphone because of its security-focused Android build and app suite, so I understand why visual appeal wasn't much of a priority. It's important to remember, however, that this is a $629 phone, and yet it looks and feels like something for which you wouldn't even pay half that. Nothing about the actual hardware is integral to the Blackphone's security features, so again, if you strip away the custom software, this is basically a Wiko Wax, which costs \u20ac187, or around $240. The Blackphone has a 4.7-inch, 1,280 x 720 display, which is all the resolution you need on a screen that size. With a pixel density of 312.47 ppi, even the smallest, thinnest fonts are well-defined. The color temperature of the display is worth praising, with blacks and whites absolutely spot-on. Other colors, too, look rich without being needlessly saturated. The quality of the panel is good in that respect, but it's lacking in other areas. Brightness is an issue, for one, as there isn't enough of a difference between the lowest and highest settings. This isn't a problem in most scenarios, but on a bright day, the display doesn't kick out nearly enough power to cut through glare and whatever fingerprint grime is stuck to the glass. Viewing angles are also disappointing, with definition and colors falling away quickly as reflections from the glass take over. Nonetheless, it's a pretty good panel; I just wish it were easier to read in direct sunlight. Software PrivatOS And now, the real reason the Blackphone exists: its privacy-focused software. The handset runs a custom fork of Android 4.4.2 KitKat with the catchy name PrivatOS (pronounced private O S). While custom builds usually layer additional features or UI elements on top of what's already there, PrivatOS does the exact opposite. In fact, it strips away almost everything you're used to seeing on an Android device. You get only the bare essentials for making calls, sending messages and storing contacts, as well as a calendar, internet browser, calculator, email and camera apps. The sound recorder is almost a luxury, as is the music player and gallery app, which doubles as the video player. That is quite literally the entirety of stock Android apps, meaning there's no Google integration whatsoever -- no app store, no maps, or anything else you might use regularly outside of the basic smartphone functions. But, that's the whole point of the Blackphone, because a raw device is as secure as it gets. Phone manufacturers have to license Google's services if they want them to work on their devices, but this doesn't really make sense for the Blackphone. It would introduce all manner of counterintuitive data traffic that's more or less out of your control -- think Google Now pulling appointment information from your calendar, Gmail syncing your contacts and Play Music cataloging the MP3s stored on your device. That being said, SGP is working toward a Google license so Blackphone users can install these services at their own discretion, and risk. Since the Blackphone doesn't have Google Play access, you'll need to get your apps elsewhere. This means sideloading or downloading APK files straight onto the device (on that note, you'll need to get an APK installer from somewhere) and/or trusting a different app store. You can sideload the Play store, by the way, but it won't even load. Of the alternatives that don't require a license, Amazon's is an obvious choice due to its relatively broad app selection and how easy it is to get hold of. Going down this route, however, will inevitably lead to the discovery that some apps simply aren't compatible with the Blackphone, or tend to crash regularly. That's part of the deal, I'm afraid. Out of the box, a setup wizard guides you through various steps to secure the handset. The first layer is the classic (and mandatory) lock-screen PIN, which has to be at least five digits. Then you're prompted to agree to standard Android data encryption, which takes around half an hour on a fresh device. After that, you have to set up your Silent Circle account, which is for the encrypted communication apps that come bundled with the Blackphone. That completes the initial setup, but personalizing the device is a little more complicated. Every potential chink in Android's armor has been plugged, or rather, removed. There's no way to sync contacts or calendars, for example, meaning you have to import these manually. And as I found out, it was useless exporting my Google Rolodex to a microSD card because the contacts app won't look for it there (and there's no file manager to move it to the internal storage). Instead, I ended up plugging in an email account and forwarding a vCard library to myself. I can't claim to be an expert in smartphone security, and yet when reaching the point of actually being able to use the phone instead of just staring at it, I was acutely aware of how walled-in it was. It's a trade-off of privacy over convenience. Apart from the email app requesting updates once every five minutes, I wasn't connected to anything. There's just no data coming in and out of the phone -- no app store checking for updates, no weather widget pinging a server for info, no freemium game hitting me with discount notifications. Silence. But, how do you know PrivatOS is really as secure as the company says? Well, apart from having a little faith, there's the fact it's attracted the attention of several security researchers in search of a challenge. SGP Technologies even made the seemingly brave move of bringing the Blackphone to a recent Def Con hacking conference, where it was rooted (which grants access to a handset's inner workings). While this is essentially true and something that shouldn't be possible, the phone was running an older version of PrivatOS that still contained a key vulnerability. Also, standard Android encryption hadn't been enabled, and the handset in question was unlocked, meaning the hack took place after the lock-screen PIN had been entered. So in Blackphone's defense, it wasn't the most realistic of hacking scenarios.

A bug bounty program has launched recently, too, offering security researchers cash money in exchange for finding vulnerabilities in either the Blackphone itself, or the Silent Circle suite of apps. Since launch, the Blackphone has received a PrivatOS update every month with bug fixes and usability improvements. SGP will also tell you how it delivers OTA upgrades securely (if you can understand it), and admits its \"products and solutions will never be perfect.\" It appears committed to taking quick action when vulnerabilities are found, however, and intends to be transparent with any information it can share about security issues. Silent Circle Part of PrivatOS is the bundled suite of security apps, including the Silent Circle encrypted communications collection that comes straight from one of the companies that own SGP Technologies. You have to \"unlock\" the apps each time you restart the handset and from there, you can make HD voice or video calls over any data network (3G/4G/WiFi). The calls are encrypted from end to end, and Silent Circle is more than happy to talk you through the fancy encryption protocols it uses to make sure your call is private. There's also an encrypted instant messing app and separate Silent Circle address book. It all works cross-platform, too, across iOS, Android and Windows. The only issue is the other person has to have the same software to receive the encrypted call, so it's not like you're immediately James Bond. The bad news is that Silent Circle requires a subscription, with the basic package costing $10 per month. The good news is the Blackphone includes one free year of the basic plan for you, and one free year for one of your nearest and dearest. Third-party partners There's also a trio of privacy apps preinstalled on the Blackphone from \"selected\" friends. Disconnect Secure Wireless is an application that routes any internet traffic through a VPN if it deems you're on an unsecured network. You can turn it on or off manually, of course, and with the Blackphone, you get 1GB of VPN-piped traffic per month for one year (this can be upgraded to an unlimited plan for $3 per month or $30 per year). Disconnect Secure Wireless also includes a private browsing feature that hinders the tracking ability of websites, and you get Disconnect Search, too. This lets you search anonymously while still using popular engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo. SpiderOak Blackphone Edition is a secure cloud-storage service, allowing you to back up files, as well as share them with others using password-protected invites. Your data is encrypted all through the process, so not even from the SpiderOak server room can you access it. Only the mobile and desktop clients, when logged in, have the right keys to unlock your files. Like most apps bundled on the Blackphone, this level of protection means you, and you alone, are the gatekeeper. There's no password-recovery feature because that would require storing sensitive data remotely. SpiderOak offers 2GB of storage free, but with the Blackphone that jumps up to 5GB for one year (this is an exclusive offer, as SpiderOak subscription plans start at $10 per month/$100 per year for a 100GB \"professional\" account). The final third-party app included in your Blackphone purchase is a free version of the Kismet Smarter Wi-Fi Manager. It basically switches off WiFi when you're away from a trusted network, and turns it back on when you're near an access point you've connected to before. It does this by remembering the position of the WiFi network in relation to specific cell towers. You can also set it up to disable WiFi when you're in range of a familiar Bluetooth device, or turn it on and off for specified periods of time. Blackphone-only A couple of privacy features are specific to Blackphone, like the aforementioned setup wizard, and an accompanying License Manager tool. This app is for reading a QR-code that's printed on a card included with the smartphone, and it automatically unlocks the one-year subscriptions to the Silent Circle suite, Disconnect Secure Wireless and SpiderOak. Another app, Remote Wipe, does exactly what its name suggests: It allows you to instruct the phone to power off, delete all data or \"brace for impact\" remotely. That third option is a force-quit command that'll kill any apps from a preset list that are currently running in the background. The Blackphone Security Center is probably the most important app on the whole device, as it lets you manage the permissions for every other app. By default, it won't give any apps you install the permission to read personal data like your contact list. Beyond that, though, you can control exactly what an app has access to, even the bundled software. You can even deny the default music player the ability to change device volume, for example. It isn't all that important when you're dealing with what's preinstalled on the device, but you can be sure you'll have complete dominion over anything you install thereafter. PrivatOS and its bundled apps/free subscriptions are really what you're paying for when you buy a Blackphone. As I've mentioned, you can get more or less the same phone for $240 under a different name. That extra 390-odd dollars goes toward not only the cost of OS development and Blackphone-only apps, but also the \"$399 in extra value\" you get from one year of Silent Circle, one additional account and the Disconnect Secure Wireless/SpiderOak subscriptions. Potential buyers should be aware that during the course of the review process, the subscriptions included with the device have been scaled back drastically -- that \"$399 in extra value\" was actually $829 a few days ago (at the time of publication). Previously, the personal subscriptions to Silent Circle, Disconnect Secure Wireless and SpiderOak were for two years, not one. Also, you used to receive three one-year gift subscriptions to Silent Circle, and now you only get the one. I asked Blackphone about this change, and was told the original bundle was an introductory offer for anyone purchasing the device within the first three months of launch. Furthermore, both customers and prospective distribution channels have apparently been \"overwhelmingly in favor\" of simplifying it. \"We believe what we offer today (and what we know is coming) will continue to support the overall value proposition the phone represents.\" Camera The Blackphone isn't targeted at your regular smartphone consumer, which is why I'm not too hung up on certain foibles like its generic design, even if it is a pricey device. In the same vein, I wasn't expecting much from the imaging experience, which is why I'm pleasantly surprised at just how capable the cameras are. Now, it might seem strange that the Blackphone even has cameras in the first place, what with it being so concerned with privacy. But remember that beneath its custom software, the Blackphone is an OEM device, not a handset designed from scratch with top-notch security in mind. For starters, there's a 5-megapixel, fixed-focus shooter up front for selfies and video calling. Not bad, considering the Blackphone could've gotten away with a simple VGA or 1.3MP sensor. The main camera isn't a huge upgrade at eight megapixels (with autofocus), but it takes good pictures in a fairly wide range of scenarios. And I much prefer versatility to resolution on the camera you take everywhere with you. Gallery | 20 Photos Blackphone sample shots + See all 20 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") In bright conditions, images are crisp and color reproduction is impeccable. The camera is particularly impressive in the macro range, with the autofocus quickly homing in on the subject of that particular close-up. The automatic camera settings are also very well-tuned -- particularly white balance, which copes with artificial lighting better than any smartphone camera I've used in some time. Auto-exposure compensation doesn't leave much to be desired, but images sometimes come out on the dark side when natural light starts working against you and you're shooting a landscape (this is the case with most handsets, though). HDR mode spits out some nice, high-contrast pictures when the scene is amenable to this kind of magic, but it really comes in handy in low-light situations. Now, the main camera isn't amazing when light is lacking, but it's at least approaching the kind of mettle Nokia and Motorola have managed to achieve despite low megapixel counts. I'm still encouraged by the number of photons the sensor is able to suck up in such conditions, but the white balance setting tends to apply an unnecessary red filter to darker scenes. This is where the HDR mode comes in handy, as long as you're willing to wait a couple seconds for the image to process. I've had no issues with white balance when taking HDR shots in low light, and it makes for a brighter and slightly less noisy image compared with a regular photo. There's always the companion flash as a last resort, and it kicks out a decent cone of light. The standard problems with using a flash still apply here, like washed-out pictures with pitch-black backgrounds. Apart from HDR, there are no other special modes like burst capture or even panorama. You're dealing with a seriously limited stock camera app that does stills, video and nothing else. That being said, it's very responsive. The app boots up immediately, and the shutter-response time is almost as quick, which somewhat makes up for the lack of burst-capture support. Image-processing time obviously increases in HDR mode, but only up to around a second in good conditions. When light starts fading, the autofocus and shutter speeds starts to decline in parallel, but this is all pretty normal. The app itself is a simple affair, with only a few settings to adjust: white balance, exposure compensation, scene selection and, of course, image resolution. Should you want to tweak any of these manually, they're all quickly accessible from the viewfinder window. There is one noticeable issue with the camera app: It hangs for about a second when you're turning the phone from landscape to portrait orientation. The majority of the time, it resumes the way it should, but it does occasionally crash. Video recording quality is just, well... OK. There's a drop in clarity compared to stills when filming in 1080p, and alongside the extra noise, it sometimes drops a few frames when you're moving or panning rapidly. Auto-exposure compensation can be a little skittish as well, but again, this is a fairly common problem with smartphone cameras. Audio quality is notably poor. Not only is the volume extremely low, but also everything sounds muffled and distant. Recordings also don't hold up in low light nearly as well as stills, but you can still opt for a grainy, ill-defined clip if the situation absolutely calls for it. Performance and battery life The Blackphone is one of only a few handsets packing NVIDIA's quad-core, 2GHz Tegra 4i SoC, and here it's paired with 1GB of RAM and 16 gigs of internal storage, though only around 12 and a half of that is user-accessible. There's always the microSD slot that supports up to 128GB cards if you need more, of course. NVIDIA has a reference device it uses to demonstrate the graphics capabilities of its mobile chip, but naturally I had to test that myself. With the Google Play store unavailable, I searched for the most intensive-looking 3D games I could find in Amazon's app store, and settled on GT Racing 2, Angry Birds Go! and Trials Frontier. (As a side note, devices with an NVIDIA chip usually come with the TegraZone Android game store preinstalled, but I wasn't shocked to see it omitted from the Blackphone, given no other app stores are accessible out of the box.) NVIDIA knows a thing or three about gaming, so it's no surprise it handled all of my choices with ease -- most of the time, anyway. I was particularly conscious of fast loading times, both when booting up the titles and hopping into different tracks within them. However, there were a few hiccups here and there, with occasional dropped frames and some minor periods of straight-up \"hanging.\" I'm hesitant to pin this on NVIDIA's chip, though, as I had similar experiences when using non-intensive apps, and infrequently when just cycling through menus or the app drawer. Otherwise, it's relatively fast in general use, but you can provoke it into stuttering by attempting to do too much too quickly -- kind of like an old PC that's on its way out. When I started to feel it getting too slow, a reboot brought it back up to speed. I've already mentioned the camera app can stall when rotating the phone, which leads me to believe there's some software optimization or bug fixes to be done. The Security Center permissions manager runs in the background while the majority of apps are open, too, which could be to blame for some of the stuttering. It never gets to the point of truly frustrating, but let's just say it's nowhere near as slick as it could be, especially when the Blackphone runs a stripped-down, albeit custom Android build. NVIDIA's chip also includes an LTE radio, which is capable of up to 100 Mbps download speeds. This is as fast as the Cat 3 standard goes, but NVIDIA has achieved Cat 4 speeds with newer Tegra 4i software. Blackphone is currently testing this Cat 4 update internally, and if all goes well, I'm told it'll be rolled out before the end of the year. For reference, the North American version supports bands 4, 7 and 17, and the international model 3, 7 and 20. I had no issues with internet performance using the stock browser. Websites load quickly (as fast as you expect them to on a mobile device, anyway) and tiling is only just noticeable when quickly zooming in and out of desktop sites. Navigating around websites is smooth, too, and it's important to note that running traffic through the Disconnect Secure Wireless VPN service didn't appear to have any impact on performance. The music-listening experience on the Blackphone is basically the same as it is on every other smartphone. It's clear and crisp enough, but missing clarity on the low end, so keep those bass-boosting headphones at the ready. It's also noticeably lacking in volume, but this should only be an issue if you're wearing leaky headphones in a noisy environment. Any over- or in-ears will render this problem moot. The loudspeaker is, amazingly, one of the worst I've come across, with distortion making music almost unrecognizable. It's just fine for taking hands-free calls, though. Connectivity-wise, the Blackphone has dual-band WiFi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, Miracast support and GPS. While this covers most bases, it's lacking 802.11ac, NFC, GLONASS, et cetera -- things you'd usually expect in a $629 handset. It's hard to really judge GPS performance, as the Blackphone doesn't have any mapping or navigation apps out of the box. A sideloaded version of Google Maps (and the mobile website) refuses to communicate with the GPS module, as does Yelp (downloaded from the Amazon app store). MapQuest (also from the Amazon store) is the only app that will successfully home in on my location, but mapping data loads painfully slowly over a cellular connection for some reason. The GPS module is supposed to be fully functional, as you have complete control over what apps can access it through the Blackphone Security Center. App compatibility issues strike again, it seems. I had no trouble with WiFi connections themselves, but it's worrying that at around six feet from my router, it still only registers two out of three bars of reception. The cellular connection is more of the same. In my South London home, I'm usually at full bars regardless of the phone I'm using, but I managed only two out of four with the Blackphone. If you're in a low-reception area or have WiFi dull spots around your house, these seemingly underpowered components might give you some trouble. On the other hand, the Bluetooth worked just fine, with quick device discovery and connections. The Blackphone's 2,000mAh battery is neither extraordinary nor terrible. With intensive use -- including browsing, downloading and installing APKs, listening to music, checking email, taking pictures and a few brief gaming spurts -- it got through nearly a whole day without dying, although I did cut back on screen time when I saw the battery dropping to alarming percentage levels. With slightly more conservative use, it lasted a day and a half without requiring charging. The competition The Blackphone retails for a whopping $629 if bought direct from SGP, and the only reseller I know of is GSM Nation, which will sell you one for only $549 (disclaimer: GSM Nation provided our review handset). For that kind of money you can have your pick of any smartphone on the market, flagship or otherwise. You're not just buying any other smartphone, though; you're buying a substrate for PrivatOS and its included apps to live on. In this respect, the Blackphone is a niche device that's all but incomparable to anything else out there. There are several encrypted-communication apps and similar privacy services for both Android and iOS platforms, but in the realm of super-secure handsets, you don't have much choice. Boeing has developed its own \"Black\" phone specifically for the military and certain corporations, which even has a modular design to incorporate extras like solar charging, satellite communications and biometric sensors. The only other security-focused device for the consumer market is the FreedomPop Privacy Phone, a Galaxy S II with added software for encrypted comms and safer internet access via VPNs. At $189, it's a bargain compared to the Blackphone, but then again, it doesn't take privacy to quite the same extreme. Wrap-up If you look at the Blackphone purely from a hardware perspective, it's nothing special. It has LTE, a good set of cameras and acceptable specs, but it's hardly a poster child for inspired design, and the display could do with being about twice as powerful. As you've heard more than a few times already, it's all about the software. That's not perfect either, though, with spotty app support and a few performance kinks that need to be ironed out. Then there's the everyday user experience. I understand you can't exactly install all of Google's services as standard and still call the thing secure, but people will inevitably want to use the phone for things other than its basic functions. Ultimately, this has to be at the discretion of the individual user, but anyone that's not au fait with alternative apps stores and side-loading APKs will struggle. The Blackphone could do a better job of supporting customers in this regard, without them needing to dig through forums for solutions. Maybe in future iterations of PrivatOS, or other security-centric phones that come to the market, we'll see a better balance between convenience and privacy. For now, though, the Blackphone is not for the faint of heart. All this being said, you can't really fault how locked-down it is, and despite the high price tag, you're essentially getting subsidized subscriptions to some of the best mobile security services, as well as useful bespoke apps like the Security Center permissions manager. If privacy is important to you, the Blackphone is almost certainly what you're after in a mobile device. Besides, you don't have much choice currently. One thing I'm still coming to terms with, however, is the concept of selling peace of mind. As Edward Snowden continues to leak information about how the NSA and other national government agencies were/are hoovering up every bit of personal data available to them, digital privacy has never been a hotter topic. With people wanting more control over how their data is handled, it was inevitable that products like the Blackphone would appear. There's a fine line between leveraging a mild global hysteria to sell a niche and expensive smartphone, and creating the best possible product to serve a growing market need -- and in that sense, PrivatOS and the Blackphone's bundled apps are likely to satisfy even the most demanding privacy-conscious consumer. I guess it doesn't really matter either way: Nobody's forcing anyone to buy a super-secure handset. And, even if the Blackphone is one of a new, shrewd generation of opportunistic ventures in this area, it can't be blamed for creating the demand. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: Blackphone, mobilepostcross, privacy, review, sgp technologies, sgptechnologies \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20963748 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20963748\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/sgp-technologies/blackphone/\"> SGP Technologies Blackphone </a> SGP Technologies Blackphone Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/sgp-technologies/blackphone/\" title=\"SGP Technologies Blackphone reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 0 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android Screen size 4.7 inches Internal memory 16 GB Camera 8\u00a0megapixels Talk time 2G, 3G Released 2014-06-30 see all specs \u2192 There are not any reviews for this product yet.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2015/03/12/fitbit-surge-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "March 12th 2015 at 12:00 pm", "body": " Confession time: I'm a bit of a wannabe when it comes to self-quantification. The idea of counting every step I take, every calorie I eat, every day I don't have a cigarette and every minute I lie in bed restlessly tossing and turning sounds great. I want to be able to look at my life as a series of easy-to-understand numbers that I can act upon to improve myself. And every time I review a new wearable or fitness tracker I think, \"This'll be the one to make it stick.\" The latest in the long line of would-be life-changers is the $250 Fitbit Surge. The combination of GPS running watch, step counter and sleep tracker appeals not only to the number nerd in me, but also to the semi-serious runner as well. It also appeals to the \"someone trying to cut down on the clutter in their life\" part of me. Why do I need a separate pedometer, GPS running watch and a regular watch? But the big question is: Can the Surge lock me into not just an ecosystem, but also a system of life-tracking and life-changing habits? Gallery | 36 Photos Fitbit Surge review + See all 36 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 78 Fitbit Surge Pros GPS and heart rate monitoring are welcome additions Fitbit finally solved its sleep-tracking problem Food database is robust and easy to use Cons Design is better suited for the gym than the office Slightly bulky body and strap Pricey for an activity tracker, even one with GPS Summary The Surge solves some of Fitbit's problems with better food and sleep tracking, while adding GPS and heart rate monitoring to the mix. But its bulky, utilitarian design and high price will limit its appeal. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware So, spoiler: I'm not wearing the Surge anymore. We'll get to the reasons why shortly, but first let's talk about what the Surge does well. The one feature that immediately jumps off the page at you is built-in GPS. Yes, the Surge marks Fitbit's first foray into serious running watch territory. It's not the fastest or most accurate GPS in the world, but it gets the job done most of the time. It reliably takes about 60 seconds to lock on to a signal (all of our tests took between 58 and 63 seconds), and spits out a reasonably accurate map of your run. It did lose signal once and the resulting map showed me careening wildly around my neighborhood. But I've also experienced this problem when using RunKeeper on both Android and iOS; it's annoying, but not unheard of. And it's certainly less infuriating than the time the Microsoft Band left me running in place for 15 minutes while it repeatedly failed to get a GPS lock. The Surge marks Fitbit's first foray into serious running watch territory. Like many other fitness trackers starting to hit shelves, the Surge has a heart rate monitor built in. Don't expect medical-grade heart monitoring, but it will give you a pretty accurate average heart rate for your run. Partially thanks to this new sensor, the Surge is dramatically better at sleep tracking than past Fitbits. As long as you don't have sleep tracking set to sensitive, that is. For the first week or so I was wearing the Surge, it seemed as if Fitbit couldn't do simple math. The app would say I slept from roughly midnight to 7AM, but only managed to get two and a half hours of sleep. On the plus side, Fitbit can now automatically detect when you're sleeping. Obviously, the Surge also counts steps. That's the whole idea of a Fitbit, really. They're connected pedometers above all else. And like its stablemates the Charge and Charge HR, it does a perfectly admirable job of keeping tabs on just how much you're moving throughout the day. The new material isn't any less likely cause rashes if you never take it off, but it is extremely soft and comfortable. In fact, it feels less like plastic and more like a hi-tech fabric used in expensive athletic clothes. You're not going to mistake it for your trusty Timex Weekender. Unfortunately, it's also a bit bulky. It's not as cumbersome as many smartwatches on the market, but you're also not going to mistake it for your trusty Timex Weekender. It will occasionally get in the way and it won't fit neatly under the cuff of a long-sleeved shirt. The wide band and distinctly athletic design also mean it looks quite conspicuous. More than once while out and about, friends gave me quizzical looks and asked, \"What is that?\" That's because when you go out wearing the Surge, you look like you're always getting ready to go for a run. And that's a problem. Activity tracking is only really useful if you're doing it all the time. If you don't want to wear it while you're not exercising, it kind of defeats the purpose. To make matters worse, it's not really a great watch. The touchscreen is far too sensitive and is rarely actually showing the time when you look at it. More often than not, you'll find you've somehow navigated to the number of flights of stairs you've climbed. Thankfully it takes several button presses to fire up the GPS; otherwise I'm pretty sure you'd start tracking a run in your sleep. And then there's the battery. Best-case scenario: You're getting a week on a charge. So much as look at the GPS, though, and that will dip to about five days. If you're wearing it to train for a marathon? Expect something closer to two. Software The Fitbit app is light-years beyond where it was back in 2013 when I first strapped one of the company's devices on. Visually, it's brighter, more coherent and generally just looks like a modern smartphone app. But more importantly, the calorie-counting portion of the app is finally good enough to run with the big boys. Where in the past it didn't take much to stump its food database (really, you've never heard of Goya?), now Fitbit is overflowing with results and nutritional data. And finding that information is easier than ever thanks to the addition of a barcode scanner (finally!). The calorie-counting portion of the app is finally good enough to run with the big boys. The other big advance is that Fitbit can finally automatically detect when you're asleep. That means no more remembering to press a button to tell the wearable it's bedtime. And, as mentioned before, if you don't turn on \"sensitive\" mode the sleep tracking is actually pretty accurate. From there you can dig through the collected data and start looking for those disturbing trends, like the fact that I average about four and a half hours of sleep a night during the week and that it takes me almost an hour to really settle into a restful sleep. Gallery | 10 Photos Fitbit Surge software + See all 10 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Fitbit still isn't the most intuitive or polished app on the market. I certainly wouldn't suggest handing it to your grandfather without an extensive tutorial. But it shouldn't give you a migraine if you're patient. Tracking exercise is at least a more visually appealing experience than in the past, and the addition of GPS maps makes it feel like a fuller solution for the more athletic out there. Plus, if you're not super into Fitbit's built-in tools, you can always connect it to other services like MyFitnessPal, RunKeeper or even use If to turn your sleep patterns into boring-ass spreadsheets with Google Drive. One area that Fitbit seems to have ignored, however, is notifications. Specifically, the ability to push text messages and caller-ID info to the Surge. There's a pretty significant delay between when a message comes in and when it shows up on your wrist. Plus it's not entirely clear how you dismiss notifications, and they're completely passive; you can't reply without taking out your phone. The competition So here's the weird thing: Since the Surge adds GPS, it means that Fitbit's competitors aren't just Nike and Jawbone anymore, but also Garmin, TomTom and Microsoft. Actually, in terms of features, the Surge's closest relative is the Microsoft Band. Sure, you can't get Twitter notifications or dictate responses to Cortana, but it does a heck of a lot more than just count your steps. Like Microsoft's wearable experiment, the Surge is supposed to go with you throughout the day. It's supposed to count every step from your door to the bus stop. You're supposed to tell it when you're doing calisthenics or going for a run. And when you turn in at night, it's supposed to measure just how much shut-eye you're getting. Of course, the Surge is far more comfortable than the Band, and its battery lasts much longer. If you just want to track how much you're moving around during the day, the Charge HR is a cheaper and sleeker solution. Fitbit's mid-range device keeps the heart rate monitor and can tell time, but it doesn't draw as much attention. And, perhaps most importantly, it only costs $150, that's a full $100 less than the Surge. If you want to go even simpler, there are devices like the $50 Misfit Flash that count steps, but pretty much stay out of the way otherwise. On the other hand, if you're looking for a serious running watch complete with GPS and heart rate monitoring, there's a pile of options from companies like Garmin. The Vivoactive, for example, has most of the same basic features as the Surge at the same price point, with better battery life and more athlete-friendly data logging. While the Forerunner series, like the surprisingly affordable Forerunner 15 (pictured above), delivers best-in-class GPS tracking and detailed tools for runners. (Oh, it also doubles as an activity tracker during your down time.) Wrap-up Here's the thing about the Surge: I kind of ended up liking it. It does a ton of different things, some of them quite well. It's a serviceable running watch, a good activity tracker and a surprisingly robust sleep monitor. The problem is: I just don't want to wear it. When I'm out for a run, its mild bulk and severe black design are a non-issue. When I'm trying to sleep or going to the office, it's a different story. The Surge lacks the subtlety of its relatives like the Flex and the fashion-minded detailing of something like the Jawbone Up. Which means it's really best suited as a running watch rather than an all-day activity tracker. However, at $250, there are more robust options for runners out there. Timex, Polar, Garmin and TomTom all make devices that more carefully cater to athletes. These running watches have fast, highly accurate GPS radios and connect to chest straps that offer far better heart rate monitoring than a wrist-worn LED. They also have advanced features for tracking progress toward goals, running intervals and coaching you through training programs. Now, that doesn't mean the Surge doesn't have a niche. There is a market out there for activity trackers that double as GPS watches (and not the other way around). If you're a casual, fair-weather runner, a dedicated running watch might be overkill. And if you're willing to sacrifice some style and comfort in the name of best-in-class step counting and sleep tracking, then the Surge's shortcomings aren't dealbreakers. It's certainly not for everyone, but if you were intrigued by Microsoft's Band only to be turned off by its poor ergonomic design, then the Surge is worth considering. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: ActivityTracker, fitbit, fitbitsurge, fitness, gps, gpswatch, review, surge, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21152165 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21152165\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/fitbit/surge/\"> Fitbit Surge </a> Fitbit Surge Small Large X-Large Buy from $245 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/fitbit/surge/\" title=\"Fitbit Surge reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 6 </a> Prices Discussions Type Wearable / clip-on Tracking metrics Motion / steps, Distance, Speed, GPS / location, Heart rate Display Yes Released 2015-01-06 see all specs \u2192 7.7average user rating Durability 7.7 Portability 8.3 Ease of use 8.7 Design and form factor 6.7 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 Displaying prices for model: Small-Black Large-Black $249.95 + tax & shipping Buy now $249.95 + tax & shipping Buy now 2 water resistant Talk about the Fitbit Surge with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 lab.scriptBs('gravity.js') onBreak({ 0: function(){}, 320: function(){}, 768: function(){} }); ", "title": "Fitbit Surge review: a top-notch tracker with a flawed design"},
{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/30/blackberry-passport-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "October 30th 2014 at 3:45 pm", "body": " Apparently I'm a masochist. That's an odd way to begin a review. But to give BlackBerry's latest handset, the Passport, as thorough a review as possible, I decided to type the entire thing from the phone itself. My twisted idea came from a realization that this (mostly) square oddity is the first phone with a physical keyboard that I've used since the Motorola Droid 4 in 2012 or the BlackBerry Q10 in 2013. It's not even a normal keyboard by modern smartphone standards -- it's a flattened, hybrid setup with both physical and virtual elements and a curiously placed space bar. Needless to say, it's an odd device, one that truly deserves the ultimate test: Can I use it to crank out several thousand words of text? Of course, there's more to the Passport than just its odd shape and the company's desire to resurrect a now-antiquated smartphone feature. I'm going to dive into what sets this phone apart from the hundreds of others already on the market -- that is, if my thumbs hold up through the experience. Gallery | 30 Photos BlackBerry Passport review + See all 30 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 75 BlackBerry Passport Pros Keyboard doubles as touchpad Long battery life Fantastic outdoor visibility Good camera Robust build Cons Don't even try using it one-handed Keyboard is difficult to get used to Awkward size and shape App selection is better now, but still needs some work Occasional hiccups in performance Summary The Passport is the best BlackBerry 10 device you can buy, and comes with a number of flagship-caliber specs. But its odd shape and size, as well as its weird keyboard, may be a turnoff for many.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Whenever I whip out the Passport -- which understandably got its name for having the same dimensions as a real passport -- I hear mutterings of disbelief that a product like this even exists. Saying it's unique is an understatement: The only device that looks remotely similar is the LG Optimus Vu, a nearly square, all-screen phone from 2012. I'll give credit to BlackBerry where it's due: Its bizarre design got people talking. Indeed, buzz is something BlackBerry hasn't enjoyed for a long time. Before the Passport, its most recent handset quietly debuted in February: the Z3, a modest touchscreen device designed for emerging markets like Indonesia. This is the first piece of hardware the phone maker has launched globally in well over a year. And not only that, but it also has the most competitive specs of any BlackBerry in years. At 128 x 90.3mm, the phone really is as wide as it seems -- it's wider than most large-screened phones on the market -- but BlackBerry insists this is a feature rather than a setback. Because it's using a 4.5-inch square display that's 30 percent wider than an average 5-inch phone, the company claims you'll read up to 60 characters per line and get a better viewing experience. In a way, that's true: I enjoyed reading articles and e-books on the Passport because text didn't have to wrap or get cut off as often, but the trade-off was an awkward one-handed fit and more frequent vertical scrolling. The two-handed typing experience was a little better than I expected it to be. As my thumbs type, my hands naturally cradle the back to prevent the device from slipping out. This is essential because the three-row keyboard sits so low on the device that the center of gravity is different than on most phones, but I never truly felt like I was going to drop it while typing. When I'm not typing, however, I want to be able to use my phone one-handed; sadly, this is incredibly uncomfortable when I'm using the Passport in portrait mode because of its width, and is especially noticeable when you try to hold it up to your ear. I asked a BlackBerry rep how the company expects people to use the device one-handed, and he responded by flipping the phone sideways. As I'll discuss in the next section, the keyboard has a touch-sensitive trackpad that lets you hold the Passport sideways and scroll through websites, emails or Twitter feeds by moving your thumb up or down on the keyboard. It's clever, but there are still clear interruptions in the user experience, which I'll cover in the software section. That said, it's still awkward no matter which way you hold it, because it's short and heavy. Its weight (196g) is reason enough to hold the thing with two hands as often as you can. But at least in return you get a robust build, with solid materials that feel like they can withstand plenty of abuse. It's got a stainless steel frame that lines the 9.3mm sides and also sits in between the keyboard rows; the back uses soft-touch plastic, with the exception of a camera module interrupting a single line of metal near the top. The display is covered with a slab of Gorilla Glass 3. The Passport's screen isn't going to win any medals, but it's got a few pros and cons. Regardless of how you feel about the shape and size of the 4.5-inch square LCD panel, its 1,400 x 1,400 resolution, which equates to a pixel density of 453 ppi, delivers a good viewing experience -- at least in terms of its easy-to-read text and pleasing visuals. But despite having settings to adjust white balance and color saturation, it still appeared much warmer, less saturated and less vibrant than most flagship phones (default or otherwise). White screens look closer to mother of pearl, while the darks are roughly the same grayish-black as most LCDs. Viewing angles are about average for a flagship. The most impressive aspect of the screen, however, is its outdoor visibility. It's one of the best I've ever seen; I had absolutely no problem reading the display in direct sunlight, which can't be said about most devices on the market. In fact, it was noticeably better than the Note 4, which is near the top of the class. The Passport has a 3.5mm headphone jack and power button on the top, with a micro-USB/micro-HDMI port and stereo speakers on the bottom. The left side is bare, but the right features volume up/down buttons separated by a convenience key used for BlackBerry Assistant and media play/pause. The device is adorned with four mics, including one hidden in the phone earpiece. There's a 2MP front-facing camera above the display and to the right of a notification LED and other sensors. Around back, there's a 13-megapixel camera and LED flash, as well as a removable section above the metal separator, which is where you'll find the nano-SIM and microSDXC slots. You'll also get a hefty 3,450mAh battery, but you won't be able to remove it. Keyboard As I mentioned in the introduction, the Passport keyboard is unlike any other I've tried on a smartphone. This isn't simply a matter of me going back to my roots as a BlackBerry owner years ago and getting reacquainted with the traditional layout used on the Bolds and Curves; I have to learn a brand-new design. I suppose that's part of the fun. This company, despite never-ending layoffs and turmoil, has churned out an impressive feat of engineering. The three-row keyboard doubles as a touch-sensitive trackpad that adds gestures to the typing experience in a very clever way. With it, BlackBerry has evolved an old-fashioned keyboard into something fresh and -- dare I say -- innovative. That's not to say it doesn't require a significant learning curve. It's not an easy board to master in a few days, but once you do, you have access to a powerful tool. Just like on most BlackBerrys of old, each key has angled frets to help your fingertips know exactly where to press. It's difficult to get used to the space bar, which is now snuggled between the V and B keys; it's also weird to adjust to the lack of symbol or number keys, since only the backspace and return keys are featured. Where's everything else? In a virtual keyboard at the bottom of the screen, which can change dynamically depending on the app you're using and the type of message you're writing. The default for most scenarios is a row of six symbols, a shift key and number button, but sometimes a number row will pop up above the symbols; when you hit the number button, a full grid of characters appears and takes up over half of the screen. The usual BlackBerry keyboard shortcuts (even the custom ones) haven't gone anywhere; neither has the space bar double-tap to insert a period. However, gestures are the real deal here: You can now double-tap any part of the board to pull up a cursor, which then gives you options for selecting text, copy/paste and so on. Holding the shift button while using the keyboard as a trackpad lets you select multiple lines of text. Swiping left deletes full words at a time. Swiping down pulls up a virtual symbol pad on the screen (which maps each symbol to a hotkey on the physical board). And swiping up toward a word-prediction suggestion automatically inserts that word. Additionally, you can use the trackpad to scroll up and down on apps, websites and other areas. This comes in most handy when you're reading articles or feeds and want to browse everything one-handed; without this feature, one-handed use on such a wide and awkward phone would be more awkward than it already is. Word predictions are an essential part of today's smartphone keyboards, and BlackBerry does an inconsistent job. For example, as I typed \"one-handed\" in the last paragraph, it predicted the term early on the first time, but took more keystrokes to figure it out the next two times. Also, after typing my first name in emails, it only predicted my last name half of the time, if that. (The other times, it'd predict \"Pitt.\") It also had difficulty predicting the end of many well-known metaphors and idioms, like \"ducks in a row\" or \"penny for your thoughts.\" In fact, I typed out the beginning of 20 of the most popular idioms and it only succeeded at guessing the final word of five of them. The constant transitioning from physical to virtual boards is also confusing and jarring. It's not uncommon for me to type random punctuation marks in the middle of my words because my thumb occasionally hits the virtual keys when I'm actually trying to type letters in the top physical row. It's also frustrating that in most scenarios, I have to do an extra action before getting to type numbers -- either swiping down or hitting the virtual key. And if I need to type a string of multiple numbers in a row, the latter is my only option. BlackBerry 10.3 Let's get the obvious out of the way: Nobody is moving to BlackBerry for its robust ecosystem of apps. To make up for the fact that developers simply aren't rushing to make BB10 apps, the company has done the best it can to provide enough meaningful programs and content for its users. Now on version 10.3 of its OS, BlackBerry has come a long way from when BB10 debuted a year and a half ago, but it's not far enough to be competitive. Unfortunately, it's instead a hodge-podge of options that confuses most users: two app stores and a method of sideloading Android 4.3 (or lower) apps. In addition to BlackBerry World, the company partnered with Amazon to bring its app store to BB 10.3. While this means users have easy access to more Android apps, it's still restrictive because its catalog has fewer than 300,000 offerings (smaller than the Windows Phone store) and many of the most-used apps aren't there. In addition to the obvious gap in Google services, you'll also find that Netflix, Instagram and Firefox are missing, as well as popular games like Dead Trigger, Asphalt and Beach Buggy Racing (to be fair, Blitz, the older game, is offered). (Update: Dropbox is natively built into Blackberry OS.) It's definitely not a ghost town, especially when compared to BlackBerry World; you can get apps like Facebook Messenger, Vine, Box.net, Zillow and Fruit Ninja, as well as the free app of the day. But it's still a drop in the bucket compared to the Google Play store selection. There are a few third-party alternatives to some of the more popular services, but even those are sparse. That said, you can sideload quite a few Android apps on the Passport (which seems to be appropriate, since the square screen matches the square viewfinder the app uses), but you have to know what you're doing. The process involves converting Android APK files into BlackBerry-friendly BAR files, which you can do using online software or manual run commands. Needless to say, this isn't a novice solution. (Update: You actually don't need to convert into BAR anymore; you can directly download the APK onto the device and install it. I tried this out with Instagram and it worked flawlessly. There's also a third-party app called Snap, which acts as a Google Play client. Thanks @Bla1ze and commenters!) The end result isn't flawless either. The current software only supports Android 4.3; it's an improvement over previous versions of BB 10, which restricted you to Gingerbread apps, but not every Android app will work this way. And even when they do work, they won't offer an identical experience to what you'd enjoy on a device that natively runs Google's OS. Gallery | 52 Photos BlackBerry 10.3 screenshots + See all 52 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Play Services also don't run here, so you're still limited to third-party apps if you use Google Drive or anything else from Mountain View. The exceptions to this are Gmail and Google Calendar, which I had no problem integrating into BB10 features like the Hub. Speaking of, the Hub is BlackBerry's universal message box, and it's one of the best I've ever used. This is part of the company's heritage: Messaging was one of the reasons the company was so successful in its early years. Hub sits prominently to the left of your home screen and houses your social media, email and calendar accounts and organizes it into one handy inbox. So if someone mentions you on Twitter, you can see it right alongside your emails, and can respond to it as if you're in the Twitter app. You can view each account separately if you want as well. The Hub isn't new this time around, but 10.3 adds a few features to make it more useful. Dragging down reveals your upcoming calendar appointments. A right sidebar lets you quickly delete messages. And there's also a new action bar, which is a new way to present the most popular actions for each app and service; the highlighted action is prominently featured in a large blue button in the middle, flanked by two smaller action buttons that stay hidden until you do a subtle swipe to reveal them. Unfortunately, the Action Bar is only available on BlackBerry apps, so you won't get it on third-party experiences. The Action Bar is but one aspect of the new UI design BlackBerry uses in 10.3. As a whole, the update gives BB10 a flatter, more modern visual style. You'll see this cleaner look almost immediately as you notice the icons in the app grid no longer come with pointless shadows that clutter up precious space. The lock screen comes with a neat new preview mode in which you can see more details about each notification without actually going into the Hub. The home screen, which is where your active apps reside, has been improved. You can fit more frames on the screen and rearrange them in whatever order you want. The active apps actually look a bit like Windows Phone Live Tiles, and when you close one, other apps will get resized to fill the empty space (each tile has a max size and you can fit up to six apps on the screen at that size). If you close all of the apps, the screen will no longer disappear; instead you'll just see a large open screen with phone and camera icons on the bottom corners. Aside from the now-shadowless app icons, the grid of BlackBerry apps remains largely unchanged. But now you can start typing from here and the new BlackBerry Assistant pops up, giving you access to search through all parts of the phone for whatever you want (think Spotlight) or for specific tasks. Assistant is the new virtual... well, assistant that is powered by Nuance and closely resembles other platform options like Siri and Cortana. It doesn't have quite the same personality as its competitors, but it takes care of nearly all of the same types of tasks. Set alarms and reminders, send messages, create appointments, send tweets, dictate notes, you name it -- you shouldn't have any problems. Like Siri, it even utilizes Wolfram Alpha to dive into deeper questions like \"why is the sky blue?\" Granted, it won't listen to your music, nor will it act like Google Now, where it learns your interests and checks your email and calendar for customized alerts or feeds. But it's a solid start for now. There are a couple new \"Advanced Interaction\" gestures, such as flipping your phone over to put it in standby mode; and lifting the Passport off a table to light up the screen. The rest of the usual BB10 gestures are still there, so fortunately you get more options. For additional productivity, you'll also have access to the Microsoft Office-compatible Docs to Go (which I'm using to type and save my review text), and Dropbox and Adobe Reader comes preloaded and lets you edit and even sign your PDF attachments. On the social side, on top of the usual Twitter and Facebook options, Story Maker takes your photos and videos and puts them into a highlight reel, just like what HTC, Sony and third-party iOS apps have done. This came out with BB10 last year, but 10.3 adds some new tricks for your videos. Blackberry Blend Apple's not the only company pushing for Continuity in its latest firmware update -- BlackBerry has been working on its own version for BB10.3. The service, called Blackberry Blend, is an app that you can download on your MacBook, Windows machine and even on Android and iOS tablets. Once your devices are connected, you'll be able to use them to manage and move files back and forth, send and receive messages (BBM, email and text) remotely, access your contacts and calendar and view movies stored locally on your BlackBerry. Once you put in your BlackBerry ID, the app sets out to connect your devices, and does so promptly. Your first view is the dashboard, which displays your most recent emails, BBM messages and SMS texts on the top, with your calendar below. If you want to take a deeper dive into any of these, or if you're interested in exploring the file manager, you'll find icons on the bottom row to take you to each one. Once you're there, a rail pops up on the left side with tabs to navigate through the app; there's also a home button on the top-left and settings on the top-right. They're large enough on the PC and Mac versions, but cramped and tiny on the tablets. Blend works well, as long as you're in the app. One advantage Apple's version offers is the fact that you can get notifications without having to keep an app open, and you can also make calls from your computer or tablet; not so with Blend. But still, if you're a BlackBerry user who spends a lot of time on other platforms, this will be majorly beneficial. (Update: Commenter JamesJohnstone brings up a unique perspective of Blend that I didn't think of: \" I believe that when you disconnect from the computer/tablet you were using blend on all the personal stuff goes with it. For me that distinction is critical because I want to be able to do personal text and email from my work computer, and at the end of the day my texts no longer be there. I don't want my SMS messages to be on my iPad at home when I'm at work.\") Camera Look, if you're in the market for a smartphone with a great camera, BlackBerry has never been worthy of your consideration. It's simply been too focused on wooing corporations and productivity-minded customers to really put much effort in its imaging assets. Ever since BB10 came out, however, the phone maker has changed its tune and pushed out nicer cameras with higher resolution; the Q10 had an 8MP shooter when it came out last year, and BlackBerry is bumping up the quality here with a 13MP rear camera. (The 2MP selfie cam isn't worth writing home about, but it certainly could be worse.) Before we even get into the camera quality, my primary issue with the shooter was its buggy behavior. It often took several seconds to load, and an equivalent amount of time to switch settings and modes. Often, I'd have to exit the app after switching to Time Shift, Burst or Panorama because it would become unresponsive and prevent me from actually taking pictures in those modes. Transitioning to the gallery and back occasionally resulted in crashes. The UI itself is minimal. There are shutter and video-capture buttons on the bottom next to the gallery and a BB10-style settings sidebar that lets you tweak HDR mode, add a timer, switch to other scenes, go into miscellaneous settings and change the aspect ratio from 1:1 to 4:3 or 16:9. If you want to take full advantage of every megapixel, stick with 4:3; 16:9 uses a resolution of 4,160 x 2,340 (it crops out the top and bottom of a 4:3 image) and 1:1 uses 3,118 x 3,118, which means both ratios come out to roughly 9.7MP. Depending on what you're trying to capture, you may see a toast notification along the top saying you might get a better shot by turning on HDR (and you can tap the notification to activate it). It's a neat feature, but it can be difficult to reach when my hands are cradling the bottom of the phone, and I'd rather have a constant shortcut available to turn HDR on and off when I want. It's also missing auto HDR; since the software is smart enough to know when my shots would benefit from the feature, it should be able to make the judgment call on its own. Perhaps BlackBerry cut that out of the user experience because it takes forever for the phone to actually take and process HDR images. (Regular shots aren't all that swift to capture either.) You won't find the Passport camera to your liking if you want control over how your photos turn out; manual settings like white balance, shutter speed and ISO aren't available. Aperture's set at f/2.0 and most daylight shots are consistently taken at an ISO of 55 (though shutter speed changes quite a bit depending on the image) to maintain the same amount of noise in each picture. Low-light shots were taken at an ISO of 888. With the UI and settings out of the way, it's time to turn to imaging performance. And to my surprise, it was better than I expected -- in fact, I'd dare say it keeps up with many of the other flagship smartphones on the market. White balance holds up well in daylight shots. Colors aren't quite as saturated as the Note 4, but they're more so than the new Moto X; shots are rarely blown out in sunlight and there's plenty of detail for my liking. The HDR mode is definitely not subtle, so several of the images came out with a cartoonish look. This works well in some instances -- especially in those cases where there are some extreme highlights and shadows in the same frame -- but just be extra cautious about which mode you choose for which scenario. Gallery | 80 Photos BlackBerry Passport camera samples + See all 80 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Low-light performance has potential for greatness. The f/2.0 aperture helps provide plenty of light for my nighttime shots; it actually pulls in more light than the iPhone 6 Plus, though many of the iPhone's images were sharper. There's also a specific Night Mode, which doubles the amount of exposure time in order to bring in even more light, but beware: Focus becomes more difficult, so you get a lot more light but most images will turn out somewhat blurry -- especially in extremely dark scenarios. (For a look at my full-resolution photos, go here.) Performance and battery life The Passport is unquestionably the most powerful BlackBerry ever made. It boasts a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chip, which comes with a 2.2GHz quad-core Krait 400 processor and Adreno 330 GPU. Not only that, but it's also blessed with 3GB of RAM. This puts the Passport in good company, since many 2014 flagships come with nearly identical firepower. It's refreshing to see a BlackBerry device that keeps up with the Joneses, and it's the first time this has happened in several years. In many scenarios, you can see where the copious amount of memory and raw power from the chipset come in handy. Switching between active apps and browser tabs were incredibly swift tasks, with the phone barely skipping a beat. The device's productivity tools cranked through their tasks gracefully: messages in the Hub, Assistant, Blend and so on. Gaming is also mostly a painless experience, but the selection of powerful titles is limited and I relied heavily on puzzle games and free titles that have been on Android for ages (Jetpack Joyride, Fruit Ninja, Angry Birds). I was able to download Beach Buggy Blitz, which worked with few frame skips and was a completely smooth experience, but on the flipside, Minion Rush was nothing but a laggy disaster. Obviously, it seems that mileage will vary here, but overall I was pleased with the general performance of the Passport. However, my generally smooth experience on the Passport was interrupted from time to time. On multiple occasions, the phone froze on me and required a restart. This is definitely not something I've experienced with the same sort of frequency on any device I've used in the last two or three years, let alone a phone that comes with a Snapdragon 801 and 3GB of RAM inside. This bug didn't seem to fit any particular pattern: Sometimes it happened when I was trying to use the camera, while other times I would be hitting a link to open a new website. I've alerted BlackBerry of the issues and the company is looking into it; I'm hopeful that it's simply a software issue that can be ironed out in a future update. On to battery life, which has always been one of BlackBerry's strengths. And with a large 3,450mAh battery to keep your phone alive and kicking, it's still a solid experience. I always had plenty of juice left at the end of the day, and on full days of typing this review on the keyboard and testing the camera, games and other services, I managed to typically have between 20-30 percent remaining. I ran a video loop test, with an HD video playing with some running services in the background, and the device lasted for nine hours and 45 minutes. Of course, I had to use a sideloaded Android app for the test, so it very well could have lasted longer on an app optimized for BB10.3. Regardless, battery life is nothing to worry about. The competition The Passport will be available in 30 countries by the end of the year, and the price will vary in each. In its home country of Canada, it'll cost $699; in the US, you can buy it through BlackBerry's website for $599 (though it's out of stock as of this writing) or Amazon for around $750 if you simply can't wait any longer. The lower price puts it in direct competition with many flagships on all mobile platforms -- most of them, including the iPhone 6, Samsung GS5 and Nexus 6, are about $650. If you want a physical keyboard, the Passport is ultimately your only option right now. There may be some lower-priced devices in emerging markets (the Q10 may still be around in some regions), but this is designed for the high-end business customer. Soon, there will be an alternative -- the BlackBerry Classic, which will come with a keyboard that's much closer to the traditional Curve or Bold design. It won't be as good a performer, but if you need a good keyboard and the Passport's odd design is a little too off the wall for you, your options are extremely limited. Wrap-up The Passport is an odd duck; it's difficult to bestow one final judgment that applies to everyone. It's your only choice if you want a high-end phone with a physical keyboard, and it's the best-performing BlackBerry in the lineup. But it also feels niche, thanks to its peculiar shape and keyboard layout. No doubt, the Passport takes some getting used to. Once you do, however, it's actually a surprisingly good handset -- the best BlackBerry 10 smartphone so far. It's well-built, comes with clever engineering and software services, has good battery life and features a screen that's easy to read outdoors. But the one-handed experience is also incredibly awkward; the keyboard isn't among BlackBerry's best (typing a 4,700-word review on the thing convinced me of that); and the company continues to struggle in its quest for a thriving and more robust ecosystem. (The fact that it has three methods of obtaining apps and still can't get the biggest titles is a testament to that.) For what it is, it's a solid device. But the problem is figuring out whom it's for, and why it matters. My sore thumbs and I haven't found an answer yet.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/12/03/yotaphone-2-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "December 3rd 2014 at 1:00 pm", "body": " YotaPhone was inarguably one of the quirkiest smartphones released last year, with not one, but two displays. This curious marriage of LCD and E Ink was certainly a manufacturing achievement, but limited uses for the secondary screen meant it simply couldn't live up to its potential. Undeterred, Yota Devices announced earlier this year it was cooking up a sequel, and today it's ready to launch the new and improved YotaPhone 2. Its fresh design, high-end specs and bigger, higher-resolution displays are welcome upgrades, but most importantly, a thorough overhaul of the handset's software means you can now make full use of the low-power E Ink screen, which has also been granted touch functionality for this generation. I've spent a fair amount of time with the device, and have to say that it's the most interesting smartphone I've ever used. Like its predecessor, the YotaPhone 2 is still very much a niche proposition with narrow mainstream appeal. That being said, Yota Devices has more or less achieved what it set out to do last year: Make a handset with an E Ink display that has several, legitimate use cases. Whether these will actually tempt you into picking one up is another matter, but the second screen is no longer an oddity; it's an asset. Gallery | 40 Photos YotaPhone 2 review + See all 40 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 76 Yota Devices YotaPhone 2 Pros Dual-screened engineering marvel E Ink screen is legitimately useful Gorgeous primary AMOLED display Top-tier performance Cool points aplenty Cons Very expensive Limited mainstream appeal Mediocre camera Yota's software still needs work Uncomfortable to hold the 'other' way around Summary The YotaPhone 2 is a stark upgrade over its predecessor, with bigger, better displays wrapped in a much sleeker package. Most importantly, the secondary E Ink screen is actually useful this time around. It has its flaws, of course, is very expensive and won't be everyone's cup of tea. Regardless, though, it's quite simply as cool as they come.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware As expected, the main design element of the YotaPhone 2 hasn't changed from the previous generation: It's still sandwiched in displays, with your standard color screen up front, and an E Ink panel behind. In all other areas, though, you're looking at a completely redesigned device that's almost identical to the prototype model shown off earlier this year. The first YotaPhone's distinctly blocky build has been replaced with soft, sweeping corners reminiscent of old Nexus handsets crafted by Samsung, particularly the Nexus S. If you took away the E Ink display, there'd be nothing revolutionary about the design of the YotaPhone 2, though that's getting harder and harder to achieve nowadays, with so many companies competing in the smartphone space. Nonetheless, its oblong shape is charming in its own right, and much more pleasing to the eye than Yota Devices' first attempt at a dual-screen handset. With a price tag of \u00a3555/\u20ac700 comes the expectation of premium build quality. While the YotaPhone 2 lives up to that unspoken promise for the most part, it's neither bound in anodized aluminum, nor can it boast any kind of waterproof or dustproof credentials. The majority of your investment goes toward the dual-screen format, not metallic accents and other flair. It's a sturdy device, however, with commendable engineering tolerances, which is to say it's put together neatly. The glass fiber-reinforced plastic band that wraps the edges of the device will creak under pressure, but the Gorilla Glass 3 panels that span the entire front and back of the handset make it hard to flex by any meaningful degree. Around this smooth plastic band, you'll find the sum of the phone's ports and buttons. Up top is the headphone jack, and on the bottom edge you'll locate the micro-USB port flanked on both sides by a small loudspeaker grille. The right side is home to a power key and volume rocker in their standard positions, with the latter doubling as the nano-SIM tray (something I probably took way too much pleasure in discovering). In terms of other physical details, it's no surprise to see an oblong earpiece and front-facing camera above the main display, and the primary camera/companion LED flash occupying the same space above the E Ink screen, with a small YotaPhone logo beneath. At 144 x 69.5 x 8.9mm (5.70 x 2.74 x 0.35 inches) and 145g (5.1 ounces), the YotaPhone 2 is comparable to pretty much every handset with a 5-inch display. It's a little taller than average due to an abundance of bezel above and below the primary display, but this slightly bloated dimension isn't something that'll put you off. Mainly because you'll be too busy trying to figure out how they crammed two displays, a 2,500mAh battery and everything else that makes a phone tick into a body that's less than 9mm at its thickest point. The level of comfort you'll experience while using the YotaPhone 2 depends entirely on which display you want to look at. The E Ink side of the device is slightly smaller than the front, and begins to curve in toward the plastic perimeter as it approaches the left and right edges. The border itself also tapers in to meet the rear glass, so as far as your palm is concerned, it's got comfortable curves in all the right places -- if you're using it like a regular smartphone and poking at the primary display. (As an aside, the matte, grainy texture of the rear glass that's common to e-paper displays feels great on the skin, even if it provides less purchase than normal glass would.) Flip the phone over to make use of the E Ink side, and it's a different story: The edges that come into contact with your hand are now sharp, unwelcoming, 90-degree intersections of glass and plastic. This hasn't stopped me holding it this way for extended periods of time, but the fact I even have to think about hand positions that spread pressure efficiently is frustrating when the whole point of the handset is to have two displays at your disposal. No doubt the YotaPhone 2 looks much more desirable than the original, but I wonder whether a blockier form factor is more suitable to this kind of handset, since it places equal emphasis on both orientations. At least, it's something Yota Devices might want to think about if it's considering a third-generation device. Having a display on both sides is something potential users might struggle with psychologically, as weird as that sounds. I mean, when do you ever put your mobile down on a surface face-first? Well, with the YotaPhone 2, you have to put it down face-first; you just get to choose which face that is. It really doesn't bother me personally -- I trust the two panels of Gorilla Glass 3 to ward off any scratch threats -- but more careful (or clumsy) users might want to spring for the bumper case accessory. This wraps the device on all sides and provides some extra protection in general, whilst also elevating both screens so they don't come into contact with surfaces. I imagine it'll also make the phone slightly more comfortable to hold the \"wrong\" way 'round, but as I haven't had the chance to test that theory... well, it's still just theory at this point. Displays Both the YotaPhone's displays have received significant upgrades this generation, but I'll start with the primary panel. What was a 4.3-inch, 720p LCD display is now a 5-inch, 1080p AMOLED affair (442 ppi), and my, is it gorgeous. The only issue I can report, though it's not strictly a fault with the display, is an overly fidgety auto-brightness setting. This isn't abnormal, however; I have the same grievance with practically every handset I've ever used. Otherwise, I've mostly praise to dish out. AMOLED displays are known for their deep blacks and vibrant colors, and that rings true here. Color temperature is pretty much perfect, as far as I can tell, and viewing angles are superb. Sunlight readability is pretty good, too, though the display doesn't quite reach brightness levels that completely cut out glare on a blinding day. The secondary E Ink display is bigger on the new YotaPhone, too, at 4.7 inches on the diagonal. It also sports a higher resolution of 960 x 540 (up from 640 x 360) and is capable of producing 16 different levels of gray. At 235 ppi (that's slightly more than the second-gen Kindle Paperwhite, if you're after a familiar comparator), there are plenty of pixels available to the second screen. By far the most important upgrade to the E Ink display on the YotaPhone 2 is that it's now fully multitouch-enabled, so you can poke at it like you would any other touchscreen. It's this functionality, coupled with an entirely new software package that includes the ability to mirror full Android on the E Ink display (more on this later), which really hammers home the device's ingenuity. It comes with one slight problem, too, in that when you're using the handset normally (AMOLED side facing you), your fingertips, which naturally rest on the back of the handset, can unlock the rear display and lock the front one, as both can't be active simultaneously. This is because the E Ink screen is reacting to the three-finger lock gesture that's enabled in Android by default. Turning off the setting resolves this niggling issue, for the most part, but you can also unknowingly unlock the rear display by accidentally performing the correct dragging gesture with one of your trailing fingers, though this happens infrequently. The E Ink display's refresh rate and responsiveness are highly dependent on what software platform it's running at the time. When poking around full Android, it refreshes extremely quickly, to the point where you can legitimately watch video (at around 15 fps, if I had to make a ballpark guess). Touchscreen responsiveness is similarly impressive, and you'll find it almost impossible to catch an unregistered tap or gesture. The YotaPhone 2 also has its own front-end that's in charge of the E Ink screen by default, and it's significantly more sluggish to navigate. Refresh rates approach a full second when moving through this UI, and the touchscreen becomes unresponsive during this period, leading you to issue repeat commands if the display wasn't quite ready to receive them yet. As you'll discover in greater detail in the software section, this really isn't that big of a deal, since there are few instances you actually need this native platform to respond immediately. And when you do, such as responding to a text via the native Yota messaging app, it picks up pace accordingly (though not always flawlessly). Now, there is one issue with the E Ink panel that can be genuinely annoying at times: The dreaded incomplete refresh, which leaves a ghost of the previous image lingering where it's not wanted. This happens fairly regularly, and mostly when mirroring full Android, but can also occur when using Yota's own platform, too. This is undesirable at best, and unacceptable when you're trying to read on the thing, which is what e-paper displays are best suited for, after all. I'm told this is a facet of the non-final software my device is running, and it's been fixed in the consumer-ready build, but that's something I simply can't confirm at this point. Camera Both of the cameras on the YotaPhone 2 are different from those found on its predecessor, but only one's changed for the better. That would be the front-facing shooter, which is now 2.1 megapixels, compared with the original's 1MP sensor. It's not much of an upgrade, and nothing to write home about, but at least it delivers that extra bit of acuity for making video calls and taking selfies (not that you need it for the latter). The main camera module is now eight megapixels, down from 13MP on the first YotaPhone. Considering the high price of the handset, it's a notable blip on the spec sheet, but it's the dual-screen setup you're paying for, not the imaging clout. Gallery | 25 Photos YotaPhone 2 sample shots + See all 25 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") The YotaPhone 2 uses the stock Android camera app, and thus has but a few fancy modes, such as panorama and Photo Sphere. Otherwise, it's a simple point-and-shoot experience, with white balance, ISO and other settings taken care of automatically (though you can add a manual exposure slider in the advanced settings, if you choose). Personally, I like the simplicity, and a smartphone camera of this caliber isn't going to win you any photography awards, anyway. I prefer snapping away without having to worry about whether I've picked the appropriate scene mode, or not. As is the case with all cameras, the 8-megapixel main shooter does its best work in bright, sunlit conditions. Even then, though, images are noticeably washed out and lacking any real depth of color. Luckily, the HDR mode can be employed to add more intensity and contrast, though that requires a steadier hand and a second or two of patience while the image is processing. Focus and shutter speed/response times are pretty rapid in general, but as you'd expect, these begin to decline as conditions worsen. Under artificial light, the auto-white balance setting doesn't cope well. It jumps around skittishly, so chances are when you press that shutter, it'll have compensated erroneously at that specific moment in time. It's in low-light conditions that performance really gives up the ghost. In dim circumstances, the camera app simply offsets the lack of photons by overexposing the scene, resulting in at least a discernible image. When the light's really failing, though, the sensor just can't pick up enough of it to produce anything but a horribly dark, grainy photo. The one saving grace of the main camera is that you can use it to take selfies. This is achieved, of course, by mirroring the camera app on the rear, E Ink display. It's a novelty, sure, but neat nonetheless. Still-image performance leaves a lot to be desired, so it's no shock video doesn't fare much better. The main shooter is capable of recording 1080p clips at 30fps, though the results aren't nearly as sharp as those numbers would suggest. The camera struggles to keep the right focal length when panning, and the auto-exposure setting is even more erratic, though I've encountered both of these issues on innumerable handsets. In low-light scenarios, I find video comes out slightly brighter than stills, but it's a minor improvement. Audio capture isn't fantastic, but it does the job. Slightly ill-defined and muffled, but clear enough for you to hear what's going on in front of and behind the lens. Software The YotaPhone 2 arrives with almost stock Android 4.4.3 KitKat on board -- various Yota customizations are running behind the scenes -- and I'm told it'll be upgraded to Lollipop at some point in the future. Google's services are all present, and it's nice to see that duplicate browsers, music players et al aren't around to clog up the app drawer unnecessarily. There's hardly any bloatware on the device, too: Office Suite, a multilingual dictionary/translation app and a Russian e-book service (non-removable). All easy to ignore, and discounting them, you're left with stock Android. I did notice one intermittent and peculiar bug that turned WiFi off at random, but a reboot seemed to address the problem and it hasn't returned since. The main problem the first-generation YotaPhone had was a lack of software that could interact with the E Ink display. It's in this area that the new device really comes into its own. Your journey begins with a slick tutorial that teaches you everything you need to know about making the most of the second screen the first time you boot up the handset. The walkthrough has you flipping the phone back and forth between displays, and since it can tell which of them is currently facing you, you're guided seamlessly through all the features. And within a few minutes, you're fully prepped to go it alone. Gallery | 15 Photos YotaPhone 2 software screenshots + See all 15 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") YotaMirror By far the most powerful new feature, YotaMirror allows you to transplant fully functional Android onto the E Ink screen. To make this happen, you press and hold the Android home key on the primary display and drag your thumb to the left to select the YotaMirror icon, after which you're prompted to flip the phone over. You can do this anywhere, in any app, and there you have it: normal Android running on E Ink. It's what I'd call the phone's killer feature, since it opens the secondary screen up to any use case you can fathom. It's worth noting, though, that while the E Ink display's touchscreen responsiveness is fantastic, meaning you can use Android at full speed, anything that requires a high refresh rate -- a video, let's say -- actually drains the battery quicker on the E Ink side than it would if running on the AMOLED panel. Thus, the E Ink screen is suited to more static pursuits, not 3D gaming or YouTube binging. Its potential is still relatively broad, however. Of course, I've had fun pushing all kinds of things to the E Ink display that have no place being there, but on a day-to-day basis, I've been using YotaMirror almost exclusively with Amazon's Kindle app. The main benefit of E Ink is that it's simply nicer to read than a backlit display, and the YotaPhone 2 makes for a solid miniature e-reader, and one you can use with any e-book store, to boot. On that note, I would've loved it if Yota had added some kind of front-lighting technology to the E Ink panel, but I'm willing to concede this may have simply not been viable option, in this generation of YotaPhone at least. Beyond the YotaPhone 2's obvious calling as a pocket-friendly e-reader, its E Ink screen can perform other tasks that require low refresh rates while conserving your precious battery life. You can leave your Spotify queue, your to-do list or the calculator app open, for example, knowing that they're not eating into your juice reserves, which is something that can't be said of regular backlit displays. Battery management is the peg, but in reality, the low-power E Ink screen allows you to use your phone in ways that just aren't feasible normally. It's easy to describe what YotaMirror does, but much harder to explain how it does it. That's because it's not simply pushing Android to the E Ink screen, but also converting it so it plays nice with the lower-resolution, grayscale-only panel. There are all sorts of processes running in the background to optimize contrast, but in my opinion, this could use some tweaking. Text will often appear a lighter shade of gray than you'd like, and a far cry from the deep black lettering you find on a dedicated e-reader. It's still easy to read, and preferable to using the AMOLED side for the same task, but it's not perfect. YotaCover and YotaPanels When you're not using YotaMirror, Yota's own platform is powering the E Ink display. YotaCover and YotaPanels are the collective names for this native software, and they're configured using the YotaHub Android app. The former essentially just refers to the always-on lockscreen, which can be as dynamic or static as you choose. (By the way, the E Ink side can be protected with a PIN or other unlocking procedure, just like the primary display. You enable this in Android security settings.) The YotaCover image can be set to change at intervals from five minutes, to once a day, to never. You can ask it to pull images from various sources, like your Facebook albums, Instagram feed or photos stored on the device. I really dig this feature, if only because now and again I'll look at the E Ink display and see a Facebook photo from yesteryear that I'd completely forgotten exists. Four bubbles sit above and toward the bottom of this image by default, showing if you have a missed call, unread text, email or other notification. You can disable this for maximum privacy, but it's handy to have there, permanently in front of you, so you don't have to keep powering up the AMOLED display to check the Android notification bar. I did have issues with these bubbles not refreshing, meaning I had to disable and re-enable them to get it all working again, but apparently this is another problem with the non-final software build my review handset is running, and is fixed in the consumer-ready release. YotaPanels is what sits behind YotaCover, and is best described as a carousel of screens that host live-updating widgets. You can fill up to four YotaPanels with preset layouts, or ones of your own creation. There are tons of widgets to choose from in various sizes, such as a clock, battery life indicator, music player, calendar, appointment schedule, recent call list and a notifications pane that does the same job as the bubbles on YotaCover. My favorite widget, by far, is the app launcher, which lets you pick three Android apps to boot immediately in YotaMirror mode -- my choices are WhatsApp, Kindle and the main camera selfie mode, if you're wondering. You can lock the E Ink screen with any of these YotaPanels showing, too, and therefore see all the information they offer at a glance. I haven't quite gotten into the habit of checking this as regularly as I could, but if you're simply after the time, or a reminder of your next appointment, you don't have to power up the more inefficient AMOLED display to find that out. YotaPanels demonstrates another great use case for the E Ink display. It's always on, consuming only a sliver of power when, for example, the time changes, and offers up lots of info you'd otherwise turn to the primary display to get at. YotaPanels give you access to more than just widgets, too. You can reply to texts, tweet, browse your calendar, initiate a call and more using native \"apps\" built into the YotaPanel UI. These feed off their Android counterparts, so you don't have two different inboxes for texts; that inbox is just presented differently in native YotaPanel form. Yota hopes developers will dive into its SDK and create more apps and features that run natively on the YotaPanel platform (a couple have already signed up), but it could also do with giving its front-end some TLC. As I said in the display section, YotaPanels runs sluggishly compared with how slickly YotaMirror functions. This doesn't frustrate me to any great extent, mainly because you don't rush around the UI or hop in and out of apps in the same way you might when using Android proper. I catch myself unconsciously exaggerating gestures and exercising a modicum of patience when thumbing through YotaPanels to deal with the slower pace. It could certainly use polishing to speeds things up, however, and to get rid of random, infrequent bugs like when a panel flat-out refuses to load. But, it's some of the widgets and apps that need more immediate attention. I'm not a fan of the native messaging experience, for one. The keyboard is as responsive as you need it to be (even if you're a fast touchscreen-typist); it's just clunky in comparison to the regular Android messaging app. I also can't get the Twitter feed widget to link to my account properly, rendering it essentially useless. These are things that can be improved over time, surely; I just don't know how long that might take. YotaPanels shows a lot of potential for maximizing the utility of the E Ink display, but it isn't quite there yet. YotaSnap YotaSnap is a feature that passed for \"mirroring\" on the first-generation YotaPhone. Effectively, it takes a screenshot of whatever's on the AMOLED display, and pushes it to the E Ink side. You take a YotaSnap in the same way you launch YotaMirror, by holding down the Android home key and dragging your thumb across to the relevant icon. The idea is that it saves way more battery than mirroring, since it only refreshes the E Ink screen once and leaves it with a static image. This is especially useful when your phone is on the brink of running out of power. Because the E Ink display only uses juice when it's refreshing, the handset can completely die and the YotaSnap will remain on-screen. It could be a map, an important note-to-self, a boarding pass or anything else you absolutely need to keep on hand if your battery dies. You can access saved YotaSnaps straight from a YotaPanel widget, too, so you don't need to bother with the AMOLED display at all if it's something you've already captured for posterity. YotaEnergy As the name implies, this is the YotaPhone 2's energy-saving feature. It dims the AMOLED display, urging you to use the YotaPanel UI and the E Ink side alone. You can control exactly what the energy-saving mode will do when enabled, like limit the processor clock speed or turn off Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS, mobile data, et cetera. One of the options is to limit the E Ink display to showing just one YotaPanel that lets you see remaining battery life and access the dialer, messaging app and saved YotaSnaps. It's also possible to set it to come on automatically when you reach a specific battery life threshold. YotaEnergy is intended to get you using the E Ink display to perform basic phone functions, and thus extend your battery life significantly. According to Yota, 15 percent remaining battery will keep you going for eight and half hours of runtime on the E Ink display, compared with less than two hours if you're using the handset as you normally would. Yota-specific apps In addition to the native features of the YotaPanel UI like the messaging and calendar apps, Yota has developed a few standalone pieces of software to run on the E Ink display exclusively. Yota Reader is an e-reading app that you can import e-books into. The fact that it's not an e-book store in itself greatly limits your likelihood of using it, but it's the one e-reading app that can occupy its own YotaPanel and doesn't require YotaMirror to use. YotaRSS is, unsurprisingly, a native RSS reader that pulls from Feedly accounts and can be accessed directly from YotaPanels. The same is true for the chess and checkers games developed specifically for the E Ink display, which require minimal screen refreshing to play. Performance and Battery Life Yota's made several compromises on the YotaPhone 2 to keep it even vaguely affordable, but luckily, it's not really reflected in the raw specs. The handset packs a quad-core 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 chip, paired with 2GB of RAM, so we're dealing with flagship-grade internals here. There's 32GB of on-board storage, but that's your lot -- no other configurations are available and there's no microSD card slot for increasing the storage capacity, which I was told had to be omitted because there simply wasn't enough space to incorporate it into the dual-screen design. It's enough for me, but anyone with a huge music collection they like to carry around with them should bear that ceiling in mind. A 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 is nothing to balk at, and needless to say, it can handle anything you throw at it with ease. Navigating around Android at pace, jumping in and out of apps, browsing the web and other simple tasks happen as fast as you would ever need them to. Gaming is a similar story. My go-to test games of NBA Jam, Shadowgun: Deadzone, Real Racing 3 and Asphalt 8: Airborne all run flawlessly at the maximum graphics settings, and to the extent that I have no other comment on all-round performance apart from saying it's spectacular. According to Yota, the reason it didn't opt to put a newer Snapdragon chip like the 801 or 805 in the YotaPhone 2 was due to potential problems with heat management that could mess with the E Ink display. The company admits these are more battery-efficient options, but added that users won't suffer because of the inherent efficiency that comes with using the E Ink panel. In terms of connections, the YotaPhone 2 supports all the major protocols: dual-band 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, GPS and GLONASS. The handset also sports a Cat 4 LTE radio (maximum download speeds of 150 Mbps) that plays nice with bands 3, 7 and 20. This covers the overwhelming majority of European and Middle Eastern carriers, which makes sense given the YotaPhone 2 is now available to those regions through Yota's website. When it inevitably starts launching elsewhere, expect the band support to be adjusted or expanded accordingly. Since most smartphones also double as their owners' primary means of listening to music on the go, audio performance is important, and the YotaPhone 2 doesn't disappoint. As long as you have a decent pair of noise-isolating headphones, anyway, because max volume tops out well below ear-spitting levels. That being said, the quality of audio is better than I've experienced on most smartphones: It's rich, well-defined and has just the right amount of bass. Stick to using headphones, though, as the small loudspeaker isn't suited to playing music through, but it's just fine for making hands-free calls. Considering long battery life is being touted as one of the standout features of the YotaPhone 2, I expected more from the 2,500mAh unit hidden somewhere between those two displays. It's not terrible by any means, and you wouldn't expect it to be with all that juice available. But, since reviewing Sony's Xperia Z3 Compact, which lasts several days without needing a wall socket, my perspective on battery life has been warped somewhat. I'm a power user that's constantly on my phone, and I can get through one day and a little into the next using the YotaPhone 2 before the remaining percentage indicator drops to alarming levels. As far as I'm concerned, that's a pretty average result. I'm willing to take some responsibility for my experience, though, as I don't believe I've used the low-power E Ink display to quite the extent that Yota expects customers would. Out of habit, I've been checking for notifications by powering up the AMOLED display, rather than letting the E Ink screen tell me when something needs my attention. With more time, I could see myself becoming more reliant on the always-on, secondary display, but for now, all I can say is that the battery life is nothing special. The Competition It's kind of hard to assess how competitive the YotaPhone 2 is, since there's nothing else like it. As of now, the handset is available in 20 countries across Europe, the CIS and the Middle East from Yota's website (Londoners can pick one up at a pop-up store outside the launch event today) for \u00a3555/\u20ac700. That works out at roughly $860-870 depending on the currency you're converting from, though when it eventually comes to the US, it'll almost certainly sell for a lower dollar price. When exactly that'll happen, Yota isn't sure. The general plan is to launch the device in several Asian markets early next year, before bringing it to North and Latin America \"soon after.\" In the UK, \u00a3555 is enough to buy you any Android flagship on the market and leave you with a significant amount of change left over, or cover the cost of a 16GB iPhone 6. None of these have a secondary E Ink display, but they all have top-tier specs and other bells and whistles like metal unibodies, amazing cameras, Quad HD screens, fingerprint readers, heart rate monitors, diver-grade waterproof ratings and more. What you've got to consider, then, is whether a secondary E Ink screen is something you're actually going to use, and how much you're willing to pay for the privilege of owning an unrivaled handset. There's no two ways about it: The YotaPhone 2 is an extremely expensive, niche proposition. Yota's under no illusions about that, though, admitting that its newest handset isn't going to appeal to everyone. Those who it will appeal to, however, are people with loose budgets that find the YotaPhone 2 a compelling and fresh alternative to what's already out there. Wrap-Up On the one hand, the YotaPhone 2 is prohibitively expensive, has a mediocre camera, sports average battery life and boasts none of the typical value-added features other flagship phones do. On the other, it has an unparalleled dual-screen design and top-tier performance. But, in my hand is easily the coolest, most interesting mobile device I've ever laid eyes on. It's a novelty, a head-turner and something you can't help but enjoy fooling around with. Playing a YouTube video on an E Ink screen makes zero sense, but the fact is, I can do what I want. And that's very much the point of the YotaPhone 2: Do with the E Ink screen as you please; explore its potential. Take a selfie with the main camera; use it as a pint-sized e-reader; extend your battery life by ignoring the AMOLED display, however gorgeous it is. Yota's managed to achieve what it failed to do with the first-generation YotaPhone. By giving users free rein on the E Ink display with YotaMirror, it's fostered a plethora of legitimate use cases, and many more illegitimate ones. It's not without its faults, of course. You're paying a nigh-extortionate amount for that second screen, and if stripped of this feature, the YotaPhone 2 would be just another Android handset. Yota's software that powers the E Ink display when you're not mirroring full Android is a ways away from being polished, and the device's designers should've made sure it was comfortable to use no matter what screen you're staring at. There are many reasons why the YotaPhone 2 won't appeal to the majority of mainstream consumers, but I dig it. If you're looking for something fresh and completely different, here it is. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: e book, e books, e reader, e readers, e-book, e-books, e-reader, e-readers, eink, mobilepostcross, review, uk-feature, yota, yotadevices, yotaphone, yotaphone2 \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21002000 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21002000\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/yota/yotaphone/2/\"> Yota YotaPhone 2 </a> Yota YotaPhone 2 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/yota/yotaphone/2/\" title=\"Yota YotaPhone 2 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 6 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android (KitKat [4.4]) Screen size 5 inches Internal memory 32 GB Camera 8\u00a0megapixels Dimensions 5.67 x 2.74 x 0.35 in Weight 4.9 oz Announced 2014-02-24 see all specs \u2192 9.2average user rating Reception and call quality 9.7 Display 10 Battery life 9.3 Camera 7.7 Ease of use 8.7 Design and form factor 10 Portability (size / weight) 8.7 Media support 9 Durability 8.7 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 8.7 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/09/19/belkin-crock-pot-smart-slow-cooker-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "September 19th 2014 at 12:00 pm", "body": " Frying, baking, grilling, searing, boiling, roasting -- whatever the method, I love to cook. It's not always easy, and sometimes it's just plain hard work, but at least it's the kind of work I enjoy. Even so, I've never used a slow cooker, and have always been a little jealous of my friends who have one. Put ingredients in and deliciousness comes out. It seems so easy! Since I hadn't yet run out to my nearest Target to add a slow cooker to my kitchen collection, I jumped at the chance to try the Belkin Crock-Pot Smart Slow Cooker with WeMo. The name is a bit of a mouthful, but the idea of a slow cooker I could monitor remotely seemed like a definite plus -- using it to check on the things I cook and making adjustments as needed. And in this case, I could do it from my phone, even while riding on the train or walking to my apartment. Convenient! Gallery | 12 Photos Belkin Crock-Pot Smart Slow Cooker review + See all 12 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 73 Belkin Crock-Pot Smart Slow Cooker with WeMo Pros Easy setup Simple operation Easy to clean Cons App has limited utility Might shut off without warning Expensive Summary The ability to check to see if your food is still cooking might appeal to obsessive-compulsive types, but for most, the added WiFi won't be worth the $130 price tag. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware At first glance, the Belkin Crock-Pot isn't all that different from the non-smart slow cookers made by Crock-Pot. It's an oval-shaped container with a silver metal exterior, black handles on each side, a glass lid and controls on the front panel underneath the familiar Crock-Pot logo. But instead of a dial, or the soft-touch buttons of newer digital models, the Smart Slow Cooker has pared the controls down to one clicky button. That button lets you toggle among high, low and warm cooking settings, while everything else on the panel is just an indicator. Any control more advanced than that has been moved to the app. Inside, the cooker has a removable, black ceramic serving dish that accommodates up to six quarts. Software Connecting the slow cooker is a relatively painless process. You'll need to download the free WeMo app for Android, iOS or Kindle first. Once the Smart Slow Cooker is plugged in, it'll create a WiFi network that you connect to. Then, when you open the WeMo app, it'll prompt you to connect to your home network. I had to restart the app to get the connection to finish the setup process, but only the one time. I feel like a lot of smart devices often require frequent restarting and button pushing to get them connected, but this went fairly smoothly. The best part is that you only have to set it up once -- even if the slow cooker is unplugged (which happens a lot given that outlets and counter space are at a premium in my kitchen), it will remember its settings and reconnect automatically when you plug it back in. The WeMo app itself is pretty straightforward, and anyone who's already invested in Belkin's smart light switches or outlets should be familiar with what it has to offer. All connected devices are listed with their connection status displayed; just click on the one you wish to control at that moment. Overall settings for the app are available via the icon in the upper-right corner of the screen; selecting this icon while a device is selected will yield additional options to edit settings for the device or even update its firmware. Once set up, the slow cooker should appear in the list of devices and you just need to tap on the circle in its row to turn it on. Each tap cycles through the various heating options, from low to high to warm, before cycling back to off. Selecting the row itself allows you to set a timer, flipping up and down between numbers. Gallery | 9 Photos WeMo screenshots + See all 9 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") In use With the slow cooker set up, it was time to give this thing a try. I settled on a barbecue-style chicken stew, with celery, onions, bell peppers, tomato and all the spices that would identify it as \"barbecue flavor.\" Unfortunately, I quickly realized that though a slow cooker means I no longer have to stand over a hot stove monitoring the stew as it bubbles away, it doesn't make the preparation process any easier or faster. I still had to cut up all the vegetables and the chicken and that still takes time, dashing any thoughts of a \"quick and easy\" meal. Once everything was chopped and squared away in the pot, with the appropriate spices stirred in and the lid popped on top, I was faced with a bit of a conundrum: Should I use my phone to turn it on or press the button on the front? I opted to use the phone to set the cooker to \"low,\" but felt mighty silly doing so since I was standing right in front of it. Experimenting with both the phone and manual controls, I noticed the phone exhibits a slight delay between temperature settings, so you might as well press the physical button when possible. There's a risk of holding the button too long in the app, accidentally setting it on the wrong temperature and forcing you to cycle through all the settings to get it back where you want it. With the slow cooker slowly heating up, beginning the process of turning my raw ingredients into a delicious, delicious stew, I left for work. It was satisfying to know that after a long day at the office, I wouldn't have to worry about what I was going to eat when I got home. It would be there, waiting for me. I managed to get all the way to work without looking at my phone, but the first chance I got, I checked the WeMo app. It was still cooking. And that's... all I knew. The app only tells you the current cooking temperature setting and how long it's been cooking. It doesn't tell you what the exact temperature of the food is, how much it's bubbling or whether the tomatoes in the pot have boiled down completely. The cooking time isn't even that reliable -- it merely measures how long the slow cooker has been on, not how long the food has been sitting in it. If you decide to raise the heat, you need to cycle from low to warm to off, and then back to high, resetting the cooking time. You can still set the timer remotely, but it'll only tell you how long you're setting it to cook, not how long it'll take the food to finish cooking. I checked back periodically throughout the day, with the same distinct lack of discernible progress. \"Yep, still cooking,\" I'd say every time I opened up the app. However, while a watched pot never boils, it was good that I was watching this pot -- one time when I checked the app, the slow cooker was off! Not sure if the problem was on my end or the pot just turned itself off, but it ended up being a good thing that I was metaphorically hovering over this stew. It didn't do it again, though, and remained on for the rest of the day. My obsessive checking got shut down cold turkey as I rode the subway home; there's no cell service underground, after all. But when I got a signal, I managed to restrain myself. As I walked to my apartment, I opened the app on my phone once more to set the pot to \"warm,\" since dinner was now imminent. Upon arriving home, I walked straight into my kitchen to take my first look at the completed stew. The tomatoes had completely boiled down and the vegetables were tender; the disparate ingredients were simmering into a reddish concoction that smelled delicious. I grabbed my large spoon and ladled out heaping portions into bowls for myself and my boyfriend, sprinkling a little cheddar cheese on top. How was it? Delicious. It didn't have quite the tartness I was hoping for, but it still was very savory with the right amount of sweetness. My only complaint -- and this does, in fact, involve the cooker to some extent -- is that the meat wasn't completely tender to the touch. However, it easily pulled and shredded apart when prodded with a spoon. Once we had finished eating it was time for the worst part of the evening: cleanup. But it wasn't bad at all. The Smart Slow Cooker itself actually consists of two pieces, the metal exterior with the heating element, and an interior ceramic bowl that can be removed for serving or cleaning purposes. We just took it out and washed it like any other bowl, wiping it down with a sponge and some dishwashing liquid, and putting it back in the cooker once it had dried. The exterior portion can be easily wiped down as well; the lack of buttons is actually useful here as there are fewer places for escaped food particles to accumulate. Wrap-up While I enjoyed my stew, and using the Belkin Crock-Pot Smart Slow Cooker with WeMo was an overall pleasant experience, I can't say that WiFi connectivity added anything particularly useful to the device. Slow cookers usually have timers so you can have it cook for just the right amount of time and have it shut off before the food gets ruined. The one advantage of the WiFi connection is that you can turn it back on after it shuts itself off -- so if you end up working later than expected, before leaving the office you can set the cooker to \"warm\" to have your food ready to go again the minute you walk in the door. But like many other slow cookers, the Belkin Crock-Pot is well-insulated, making it unlikely that your food will get cold (or even lukewarm) before you get home, even when you stay out late. A little extra information in the app would have made the Smart Slow Cooker more useful, like the current temperature of the food and how long it's been in the pot. The app could use some improvements in general -- while WeMo is compatible with If This Then That (IFTTT), there's no specific compatibility with the slow cooker. I couldn't, for example, set up the Smart Slow Cooker so that it would occasionally brag on Twitter about the awesome stew I was making. In its current state, all the app does is move the controls from the front of the cooker into your phone. Instead of being something you \"set and forget,\" the connectivity makes it possible to obsess over your food all day. Maybe some people like that degree of control, but for most, it's not worth spending $130 when a regular slow cooker can be had for as little as $30. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: Belkin, BelkinWeMo, Crock-Pot, Crock-PotSmartSlowCooker, review, slowcooker, WeMo \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20961777 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20961777\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/belkin/crock-pot/smart-slow-cooker/with-wemo/\"> Belkin Crock-Pot Smart Slow Cooker with WeMo </a> Belkin Crock-Pot Smart Slow Cooker with WeMo Buy from $112 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/belkin/crock-pot/smart-slow-cooker/with-wemo/\" title=\"Belkin Crock-Pot Smart Slow Cooker with WeMo reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 0 </a> Prices Discussions Announced 2014-01-06 Price $129.99 USD Colors Silver see all specs \u2192 There are not any reviews for this product yet.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2015/03/11/chromebook-pixel-review-2015/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "March 11th 2015 at 2:00 pm", "body": " The Chromebook Pixel was the most beautiful laptop that we told people not to buy. With a machined aluminum chassis, pixel-dense screen and a spacious keyboard, it had a design that in some ways outmatched even the Retina display MacBook Pro. The problem: It ran Chrome OS for an operating system, with no support for the sort of desktop apps you'd expect to use on a $1,299 machine. Speaking of the sort, it cost $1,299. Oh, and the battery life was short too -- barely four hours on a charge. So much for having a portable machine you could take anywhere. It was, as we said at the time, \"a lovely thing that everyone should try to experience, but few should seriously consider buying.\" 81 Google Chromebook Pixel (2015) Pros Beautiful, high-res display Incredible build quality Great keyboard and trackpad Long battery life, charges quickly Mix of regular and USB Type-C ports Cons Chrome OS has come a long way, but still has limitations Still feels\u00a0expensive for what it is No real change in the thickness or weight Summary Though the Pixel looks the same as its predecessor, it feels like a big improvement, thanks to its tripled battery life and lower price. Chrome OS has come a long way too, to the point where the idea of doing everything online doesn't seem like as crazy an idea as it once did. That said, as well-designed as the Pixel is, $999 is a lot to pay for a laptop that only runs Chrome OS, especially when comparable Mac and Windows machines can run all manner of desktop apps -- including the Chrome browser. \u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") As far as Google was concerned, though, the Pixel was just ahead of its time. That, and maybe it needed a little refining. Not to be deterred, the company just released a second-generation model, also called the Pixel. The idea, as Google explains it, is that it keeps everything people loved about the original, while correcting everything that made it a tough sell. That means the design is virtually identical, with an all-metal shell, 12.85-inch, 2,560 x 1,700 touchscreen and a well-spaced keyboard. This time, though, the battery is rated for 12 hours, partly thanks to Intel's latest Core processors, and there are two reversible USB Type-C ports like the kind used on the new MacBook announced earlier this week (except in this case, there are some regular USB connections too). Meanwhile, Chrome OS is more polished than it was two years ago, and can now run a few Android apps. Most importantly, perhaps, Google dropped the Pixel's starting price to $999. A 23 percent price cut isn't exactly a trivial difference, but is it enough to turn the Pixel into a practical purchase? Not quite. But almost. Hardware As I said, with the exception of those new USB Type-C ports, the new Pixel looks just like the old one. So, I probably shouldn't spend too much time fawning over the design, as if it were brand-new. That said, I want you to understand how well crafted, how delightful to use this thing is. The aluminum chassis here isn't just reminiscent of a MacBook, but actually better made in some ways, with a softer finish and a denser body that feels weightier in-hand. (In fact, it weighs less than the 13-inch Retina MBP: 3.3 pounds versus 3.48.) As before, there's a thin LED strip on the lid, except now, you can double tap it to see roughly how much battery life you have left (up to four bars will light up). It's a handy feature, though I haven't used it much, mostly because the battery life is so good I never worry about having enough juice for the day. Meanwhile, a few other details -- a low-rise hinge, black rubber feet and a skinny bumper around the touchscreen -- also lend the impression that someone at Google put a lot of thought into the design. So does the display. I'm simply not used to seeing this nice a screen on a Chromebook. In fact, I don't think I've seen one this nice since the first Pixel came out two years ago. As before, the Pixel has an oddly shaped 12.85-inch panel, with an equally uncommon resolution of 2,560 x 1,700. That's a 3:2 aspect ratio, by the way, meaning it's noticeably taller than your typical 13-inch laptop screen. Indeed, thanks to those extra vertical pixels, the screen density comes out to an impressive 239 ppi, making it ever so slightly sharper than the 13-inch Retina display MacBook Pro (227 ppi). Not that you can spot the difference. In addition to being sharp, the Pixel's display boasts rich colors and wide viewing angles. As it turns out, too, that Retina MBP comparison is an apt one, and not just because of their similar screen resolution; the quality is on par, too. In addition to being sharp, the Pixel's display boasts rich colors and wide viewing angles, even despite the touchscreen's glossy finish. The visibility is so good, in fact, that when my seatmate on a recent flight asked me to open the window shade, I could make out the contents of the screen, even with sunlight streaming in next to me. My only concern is that the tall display could be a problem for travelers stuck in coach. As it happens, I was seated in Economy Plus on a newer plane, and the person in front of me was kind enough not to recline, but I bet that on a smaller aircraft (and with less considerate neighbors), things would have gone differently. Heck, even with the 13-inch Air, which has a lower-slung screen, I've had problems using it in coach. Google's \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" philosophy applies to the keyboard as well. For all intents and purposes, this is the same tactile, well-spaced keyboard as last time, with one exception: Whereas the row of function keys used to have a stiff feel, they now have the same shape as all the other buttons on the keyboard. And that's a good thing. With the exception of my Google password, which has a lot of special characters and is easy to mess up -- I was able to type at a fast clip with very few typos. The buttons don't even have that much travel, per se, but the keys are large and easy to hit, and they're springy enough that I didn't have to mash the keys in order for my button presses to register. The touchpad is also a joy to use: spacious with smooth, controlled tracking. That leaves one of the few things that's actually different about the design, and that's the ports. As I mentioned, the new Pixel has two reversible USB Type-C ports -- the same sort used on the new MacBook announced earlier this week. But whereas Apple caused a controversy by including just one port on its new flagship laptop, Google mercifully built in two Type-C connections -- along with two \"regular\" Standard A USB ports for good measure. In particular, I like that there's one Type-C port on either side -- it means I have some flexibility in terms of where I plug in the charging cable. As I type this, for example, I'm sitting in a middle seat on a plane, with a power outlet on either side of me. The lady on my left indicated she might need an outlet at some point. Good thing there's another one on my right, with a nearby power plug to match. Finishing up our tour, there's also a headphone jack and full-sized SD card; kind of a crucial detail on a Chromebook with only 32GB of built-in storage. Basically, then, you have all the ports you'd likely want, unless you were holding out for an HDMI socket. (And if you were, you've heard of Chromecast, right?) Truly, it seems that as long as there are still standard USB 3.0 ports there, you get the best of both worlds. On the one hand, you can charge gadgets faster over USB Type-C than a regular micro-USB port. You also can get away with carrying just one power brick for all your gadgets, including your Pixel and whatever phones or tablets you own. At the same time, you don't need an adapter to use your existing peripherals (Ethernet adapters, USB headsets, etc.). Apple might be right that people will one day require fewer ports, and that USB Type-C, in particular, will be ubiquitous. But we're not there yet. For now, then, this mix of old and new USB sockets feels like a sensible compromise. Software Chrome OS has come a long way since we reviewed the original Pixel, back in February 2013. First off, most every Google app has offline access, including Gmail, Drive, Music and Google Play Movies & TV. Many third-party apps, such as Pocket and Amazon Kindle Cloud Reader, now work offline, too. In fact, the selection is big enough that there's even a section of the Chrome Web Store dedicated to offline-capable apps. In short, then, the idea that Chromebooks are crippled without an internet connection is a big fat myth. I will say this, though, there is nothing more infuriating than being locked out of a Chromebook during a flight because you have two-factor authentication and can't receive your six-digit code over SMS. That happened to me while testing another Chrome OS laptop recently and, well, let's just say I won't be making that mistake again. Always have backup codes handy, kids. The idea that Chromebooks are crippled without an internet connection is a big fat myth. What else has changed in the last two years? It's now easier to juggle multiple accounts. As of late last year, Chromebooks have always-on, \"OK Google\" voice search. The Pixel's touchscreen now supports pinch-to-zoom. You can remotely lock your machine if it gets lost or stolen. The file manager is better organized. Chrome OS sends photos to Google+ in the background, even if you don't have the app open. And hey, if Chrome OS isn't enough, you can load a new operating system through a USB drive (or you could just run it in its own window). Speaking of different platforms, you can now run a handful of Android apps, including Vine, Evernote and Flipboard. The selection is still small, but it's a nice-to-have feature nonetheless. But it's not just Chrome OS that has matured; the rest of the web has caught up too. Though I still can't do everything I need to on a Chromebook, most of the services I use, or could possibly want, are now in the cloud. Skype, one of the biggest apps I used to miss on Chromebooks, is now accessible from a browser. So is HipChat, the messaging client Engadget staffers use to communicate with each other. (Ditto for Slack, which many other workplaces use.) Like most people, I also make good use of music-streaming services like Spotify, Slacker and Pandora, all of which have a cloud player. Netflix works fine here too, even though there were some compatibility issues years back. The same goes for Amazon Prime Video, Hulu Plus and the like. I can do almost anything I want on a Chromebook. If you think there's a chance you'll miss one of your usual desktop apps, you might just want to buy yourself a similarly priced Mac or Windows machine. The keyword is \"almost.\" There are still some gaps. The software updater for my Garmin running watch won't install on a Chromebook. I can't install iTunes on the Pixel, though I can upload my collection to Google Play Music. I happen not to be a gamer, but if I were, I wouldn't be able to download Steam, or play any truly native games -- beyond the mobile-style titles found in the Chrome Web Store. There's no web-based video editor that matches the ones I might use on a desktop. Meanwhile, most of Adobe's Creative Cloud apps aren't available on Chromebooks. Technically, Photoshop is compatible, but for now it's only available in beta to education customers. I could use Chrome's Remote Desktop feature, I suppose, but that's a clumsy solution compared to simply loading an app on my local machine. Depending on who you are and what you do with a computer, it's possible that none of these will be dealbreakers for you. But if you think there's a chance you'll miss one of your usual desktop apps, you might just want to buy yourself a similarly priced Mac or Windows machine -- and then install the Chrome browser for when you need it. Because when a laptop costs $999, you should be able to use it exactly how you want; you shouldn't have to resort to workarounds.

Of course the Pixel is faster than other Chromebooks: It has a fifth-generation Core i5 processor, Intel HD 5500 graphics and 8GB of RAM, compared with a Celeron CPU and 2GB to 4GB of RAM on most competing models. It's no surprise, then, that the Pixel swept its rivals in every web-rendering test, including SunSpider, Mozilla Kraken and Google's own \"Octane\" benchmark. Now, I've always contended -- and still contend -- that even those lower-powered Chromebooks are still sufficient for basic tasks like email, web surfing and chatting. Still, the Pixel is noticeably brisker. And really, who's going to argue with faster performance? In addition to booting in a swift five seconds, the Pixel is quick to load new windows, as well as toggle between open tabs. Additionally, the built-in 802.11ac WiFi radio was quick to reconnect to known networks after the machine had been asleep. Battery life Chromebook Pixel (2015) 10:01 MacBook Air (13-inch 2013) 12:51 HP Spectre x360 11:34 ASUS C200 11:19 Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, late 2013) 11:18 Acer Chromebook 13 10:07 Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus 8:44 Samsung Chromebook 2 (13-inch) 8:22 Dell XPS 13 (2015) 7:36 Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro 7:36 Acer Aspire S7-392 7:33 Microsoft Surface Pro 3 7:08 Acer C720 Chromebook) 6:27 (Core i3) / 5:57 (Celeron) Toshiba Chromebook 2 6:34 Chromebook Pixel (2013) 4:08 Google rates the new Pixel for 12 hours of battery life -- a marked improvement over the original, which only promised five hours of runtime. Though I never quite made it to the 12-hour mark, it's clear the battery life is a markedly better here: I got 10 hours of continuous video playback -- not far off Google's own estimate. Also, as an experiment, I packed the Pixel's charger in my checked luggage, so that I would have to rely solely on the Pixel's built-in battery to get me through a cross-country flight. After three and a half hours of consistent web surfing, chatting and word processing, I still had 66 percent, or six hours, left according to the battery icon in the system tray. I'm no mathematician, but I think that means I would have achieved nearly 10 hours of use. Additionally, the Pixel touts some fast charging -- two hours in 15 minutes, or a full charge in two hours, according to Google. I actually believe that's a conservative estimate. After just 17 minutes, I had a 29 percent charge, or around 3.5 hours of juice. All told, it took me an hour and 41 minutes to return to a full charge, which was even faster than I was expecting. Configuration options and the competition The Pixel starts at $999 with a fifth-generation Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. If money is no object there's also a $1,299 \"LS\" (ludicrous speed) model with a Core i7 CPU and 16GB of RAM. Either way, you get 1TB of Google Drive storage, free for three years. And, like every other Chromebook, you're automatically entitled to 12 free Gogo in-flight WiFi passes. A nice perk, that, but is it worth the $999 asking price? Not for most people. For a hundred dollars less, you can get the HP Spectre x360, which also has a machined aluminum chassis and a roughly three-pound build, except it also runs traditional desktop programs. For a little more money, you can find plenty of machines that more closely match the Pixel on the spec front, especially screen resolution. Lenovo's Yoga 3 Pro convertible is currently going for $1,200 with a 3,200 x 1,800 display and a 2.6-pound build. The 2.6-pound Dell XPS 13 also has a 3,200 x 1,800 display for $1,300, though you could also get a lesser configuration for as little as $800. Meanwhile, the 13-inch Retina display MacBook Pro starts at $1,299 with an aluminum chassis and a display that matches the Pixel in both quality and pixel count. To be fair, not all of the machines here can beat the Pixel on battery life, but some do: both the Spectre x360 and 13-inch Retina display MBP last roughly 11.5 hours. Wrap-up Four years after the first Chromebook came out, the idea of a laptop running the Chrome browser as an OS is still a niche proposition. These things aren't for everyone, and might never will be. That said, the idea doesn't seem as silly as it once did. Personally speaking, I wouldn't buy one -- but that's mostly because it won't run Photoshop, and it doesn't play nice with certain peripherals like my running watch. Barring that, though, I love the Pixel. Between the design, display, keyboard and battery life, it's among the finest notebooks I've had the pleasure of using. I'm sad to have to give my review unit back. Even so, I'm running out of excuses. More and more apps now run in the browser, including big holdouts like Skype. Although I personally require certain desktop apps, there are surely others out there who would have no problem living in Chrome. If that's you, you're getting hardware that stands up to the Retina display MacBook Pro as well as many Windows flagships, and you'll probably pay slightly less than you would for a machine with similar specs. That said, if you think you'll need certain desktop programs from time to time, a Mac or Windows Ultrabook is still the more practical choice. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: chrome, chromebook, chromebook pixel, chromebookpixel, chromebooks, chromeos, google, pixel, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21150225 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21150225\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); lab.scriptBs('gravity.js') onBreak({ 0: function(){}, 320: function(){}, 768: function(){} }); ", "title": "Chromebook Pixel review (2015): less expensive, still impractical"},
{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/04/lg-g-watch-r-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "November 4th 2014 at 5:00 pm", "body": " I think it's fair to say by now that smartwatches are no longer the \"hot new thing.\" It's an established product category. The paint might still be a little wet on the whole idea, and some might argue there are areas that still need improving, but these clever timepieces are officially here to stay. That's thanks in no small part to Android Wear, Google's platform that brought some sanity/unity to the wild west of wrist-worn Android tech that came before. With the software side of things taken care of, hardware manufacturers can now focus on the gear. So far, in terms of Android Wear devices, we've seen efforts from LG, Motorola, Samsung and today, well, LG... again! Barely four months after launching the LG G Watch, the Korean firm is back with another one: the G Watch R. Whereas the G Watch was a square, unpolished and, perhaps, unfinished affair, the G Watch R we're looking at today is a different beast altogether. It has a much more traditional design with a round display, leather strap and more. Was LG just eager to catch the first wave of Wear devices? Is the G Watch R the Wear device it should have released to begin with? More importantly, at $300 through AT&T (making it the priciest Wear device yet), do you want one? Gallery | 31 Photos LG G Watch R review + See all 31 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 76 LG G Watch R Pros Attractive design Full circular display Improved battery life Cons Not very unisex Strap a bit stiff A bit pricey Summary In the fast-moving world of Android Wear devices, you don't get long at the top it seems. The G Watch R looks just as good as the Moto 360, and with the best battery life of any Wear watch to date, it (just) beats the Motorola in the battle for Android Wear supremacy. There's just the small issue of price to consider. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware I'm not saying that LG rushed the original G Watch to market, but on first sight, if you had told me, with its bland, square design and generic rubber strap, it was a prototype, I'd have believed you. The G Watch R (and that R is important), is a whole other kettle of fish. As I mentioned already, the big hardware difference isn't some nifty hardware feature (though it does have a heart rate monitor this time); it's that design. It does seem a little surprising that we've seen many, many smartwatches and, to a lesser degree, Android Wear devices, yet still we're excited to see one that looks like a regular watch. We should be excited about features, not just because a device finally looks like a proper watch. LG's latest effort isn't going to give Rolex any cause for concern, but if you snuck it among a bunch of men's watches (it is definitely more masculine than unisex) in a retail store, it wouldn't stand out like a sore thumb. If that sounds like a backhanded compliment, that's because it kinda is. The G Watch R might be a step forward for Wear devices in terms of design, but it's still fairly neutral-looking in horological terms. A steel body houses the circular display, and there's a (non-rotatable) dial with the minute/five-minute/quarter-hour markers on it. Not so handy if you opt for a digital face, but it certainly adds to the effect when using an analog-style one. There's also a button on the side where the crown would normally go. It doesn't wind; instead it returns you to the home screen, wakes the watch from standby and takes you to the settings on a long press. A nice touch. The strap is also an improvement from the original G Watch's rubber one. This time it's real leather. Nice as that is (it certainly passes the smell test), I found it to be a little stiff -- almost cardboard like. It seems to have softened a little with use, but it's not the most luxurious-feeling hide I've experienced. It's also not the most comfortable. It's not constantly irritating or unpleasant, but I do find myself adjusting it from time to time. The good news is, if you don't like it, you can replace it with any standard 22mm strap of your choice. Looks are one thing, but it's what's on the inside that counts, right? It's here that the G Watch R suddenly becomes less of a departure from the original (or any other Wear watch for that matter). It has the same 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon 400 configuration, the same 512MB of RAM, 4GB of internal storage, Bluetooth 4.0, accelerometer and IP67 waterproof rating (submergible to one meter for about 30 minutes). The battery gets a very minor boost from 400mAh to 410, and the G Watch R gets a heart rate monitor as mentioned -- which is new this time round. Lastly, if you were hoping for wireless charging, no dice there, sadly. This, too, uses a proprietary cradle, along with a micro-USB cable. If you're wondering how big it is, the body of the watch is 46.4 x 53.6 x 11.1mm. By comparison, the Moto 360 is 46mm in diameter by 11.5mm high. The G Watch R feels slightly less chunky than the Motorola thanks to the smaller, recessed screen (1.3 inches across against the 360's 1.6). The thicker bezel on the LG gives the optical illusion of the whole face being even smaller. With most of the specifications between the 360 and the G Watch R being so similar, it's details like these that are going to be deciding factors. One of those we're about to tackle next. Display You might have made it through the hardware section thinking, \"I can't believe they didn't mention that fully circular display!\" Right, because I'm giving it its own section. We're assuming the \"R\" in G Watch R is for \"round.\" Either way, LG's clearly delighted that the display is a complete circle, and doesn't have the black bar at the bottom that the Moto 360 has. How do we know? The company may have made reference to it filling the gap -- not to mention, the press materials start with \"Smart Comes Full Circle.\" Motorola's \"flat tire\" (as it has become known) is caused by the 360's ambient light sensor needing somewhere to live. LG solved this problem by not including one. This means the G Watch R won't auto-adjust screen brightness relative to your surroundings, but I think this was the right choice, given the clear aesthetic win. There are other trade-offs, though. At 1.3 inches across, the LG's Plastic OLED display is smaller than the 360's, but on the flipside, with the same 320 x 320 resolution (or mostly same; Motorola's is 320 x 290) it has a small edge (no pun intended) on the sharpness front. Another advantage of LG's OLED display is that it's going to be gentler on the battery. A scourge of smartwatches has been that they tend to go into standby to save battery, sorta negating their use as a timepiece you can glance at (aka, a watch). A backlit LCD (like on the Moto 360) theoretically requires about the same power to light one of its LEDs, as it does all of them. An OLED works differently, broadly speaking, only requiring enough power for the LEDs that are currently lit. So, when the G Watch R is in \"always on\" mode, after a few seconds, the watch face changes to a minimal black screen, just showing the time, and any active notification -- meaning you can always have the time showing, without it zapping the battery. It seems to work, too, as I'll cover later. The display itself is bright and crisp. Colors look natural, with maybe just a hint of oversaturation, while blacks are nice and deep (as you'd hope with an OLED). You won't find yourself looking at too many photos of course, but some of the watch faces you can choose include wallpaper/pictures, and they look great on the small display. While there's no auto-brightness feature, I found it easy enough to view in daylight, only having to jack up the level in the most direct sunshine. As for viewing angles, these are great, meaning you can clearly read the watch face while typing or glancing down while walking (no need to lift your arm all the way). Android Wear's interface, with all its cards and pastel colors, translates well to the circular layout for the most part, though some of the text can be bunched up, or cut off from the notifications, which is frustrating at times (you can swipe to see all the text, but hey, I'm lazy...). Some might argue this negates the benefit of a smartwatch (after all, you could just slide out your phone), but I didn't find it inconvenient to the point of annoyance. Another downside specific to a circular screen is that you can see the corners of pixels breaking the smooth line, as you follow the edge of the OLED around. It's not distracting, but it can catch your eye from time to time. In use If you've not used Android Wear before, then the brief summary is that it's a mix of Google Now and phone notifications boiled down to a watch-friendly format. Given that the software on Wear devices is always the same (unlike Android on phones, which is famously customized by manufacturers), there's little to add here that we haven't covered already. Instead, I'll focus on those features that made themselves more useful on the G Watch R. First up is the heart rate monitor. It's hardly the first smartwatch to offer one -- not even the first Wear device (Samsung's Gear Live). But, it is the first LG Wear watch with this feature, so that's something, right? The good news is, it actually works really well. In other devices I've tried (looking at you, Galaxy S5), it can feel like a bit of a last-minute add-on, but the sensor here is quick and (compared to taking my own pulse) accurate. Just ask the watch \"What's my pulse?\" or \"Show me my heart rate\" and in a few seconds you'll get your number. This then pipes into Google's Fit app, to keep all your activity data in one place. This will be even more useful when combined with the step counter that's standard in Android Wear. As more watches get GPS support (not the case here; Sony's SmartWatch 3 will be the first), the fitness credentials will suddenly become even more useful -- let's just hope battery life doesn't take too much of a hit. One other new feature is actually not specific to the G Watch R, but it's new to Wear, and we've not covered it before on Engadget beyond the news: the ability to store and play music directly from the watch. So, if you want to go running (for example), you no longer have to bring your phone along if you want some music. I followed Google's instructions for transferring music to the letter, and nothing happened. The LG G Watch R later prompted me that there was an update, so I installed this. I tried following the instructions again (basically there's a tick box in the Play Music Android app) and again nothing. Then some time later, a card popped up saying it was transferring music. Great. Despite the unclear setup process, it's definitely nice-to-have functionality, and it shows that Android Wear as a platform is growing with the hardware that's running it. It's still pretty basic for now -- you can't choose exactly which music to sync, for example -- but hey, it's progress. Currently there are no alternative music player apps for Wear, but that's something we'd expect to change soon. As for actually navigating around the G Watch R, again, it's more of the same. If nothing else, it's a testament to how much Google is trying to ensure the experience is the same, which is something that can't be said for its mobile OS. The side button wakes and puts your device to sleep. Lifting your wrist will also (theoretically) wake the watch too, and activate the voice recognition, for a seamless experience. The reality, however, does leave a few stitches showing (but maybe not full seams). By that I mean, not every time you lift your wrist, hoping for the watch to spring to life, will it do so. This leaves you in an awkward pose, expectantly staring at your watch. In fairness, this has been true of all watches I've tried with this feature, but I do feel the LG is perhaps slightly less responsive than those I've tried so far. No bother, when this situation arises, you just casually touch the screen -- as that will also wake it. So, really, you have three options when it comes to waking up the device, which should cover most bases. As for the voice recognition itself, I've always found it to be pretty good. For example, when you receive a Hangout, or SMS, et cetera, you can swipe left, and find a \"reply\" option. This sets the watch listening, and you simply speak your message. I managed to conduct continued \"chats\" using just the watch and this method. Again, it's not perfect -- about a third of the time there was a slight error, and perhaps 15 to 20 percent of the time I had to cancel the message and try again. But, if you're chatting with a friend that will let things like \"see you laker\" slip, then you're good. Especially as it often seems to send the message even though you thought you canceled it! Also, the feature whereby notifications (for all those replies!) can be dismissed from view, for addressing later is present this time around also. Which is good news, as it's great to be able to clear them from your display, while knowing you can check back later. Battery life and performance Ok Google, what about the battery life? That's pretty much what most Android Wear users have been asking. With good reason, too. So far, none of the watches we've tested have managed to last much longer than a day's use. Even then, you'll basically wake up needing to charge it right away. LG only added a tiny 10mAh boost to the cell from its last watch, so we weren't expecting much. But, I am fairly pleased to report that I regularly got two days' use out of the thing between charges. That's with a decent amount of interaction with it: lighting up the screen, voice commands, getting plenty of notifications and so on. Also, this is with the screen set to \"always on\" (the mode that dims everything, but still shows the time). With the watch set to time-out to black, and with more moderate use, there might be hope of reaching day three. I'm just incapable of moderate use, it seems. Another positive side effect, and of course one of the selling points of smartwatches generally, is that because you likely end up using your phone less -- by not constantly checking it, and dealing with some basic tasks right through Wear -- you also get better battery life from your phone. You might counter that by saying, \"But you do have two batteries on the go/in the mix,\" and we won't argue with that, but as a combined experience, it should help you reach two days between charges for both devices that little bit easier. Don't get me wrong -- even two days is still way off from what we'd like to see for a smartwatch's battery life, but again, progress. Measuring a smartwatch's performance isn't an exact science, but as you can imagine, with a 1.2GHz, dual-core Snapdragon running the show (something that would have been in a flagship phone not all that long ago), and relatively light tasks to take care of, performance is smooth. I never experienced any screen stutters, or pauses between menus and opening messages, etc. The biggest factor, if anything, is going to be how close you are to your phone, and how speedy its internet connection is. The competition As of this writing, if you're in the market for an Android Wear device, you have a total of four options (five if you include the pre-orderable Smartwatch 3). One of them is the device that (as many will see it, even if both will remain on sale) the G Watch R replaces (unless you really like the design of the original G Watch). We called Samsung's Gear Live the best Android Wear watch at launch, but its tenure on the throne was short-lived. The Moto 360 soon usurped it, but then at $250, it is more expensive (about 20 bucks more than the original LG and 50 over the Samsung). Right now, LG hasn't revealed the official price for the G Watch R, but AT&T is the first retailer to break cover, offering it for $300 starting November 7th. This price at least means Motorola won't be having too many headaches. If it had been priced around the same, then, it might have been a different story. Personally, I think the LG is a smidge better, but I'm not sure it's a full $50 better. In fairness, $300 is too much for any Android Wear device right now. I would be very surprised if you can't pick it up for less once more retailers announce availability. Wrap-up With better battery life and a fully circular display, the G Watch R has two distinct advantages over its nearest rival. In many ways, that makes it an open-and-shut case. But, of course, with wearables it's never as simple as that. You may well prefer how the Moto 360 looks. Or, heck (we're not judging), maybe you think the Samsung and OG G Watch are the last word in fashion. And of course, there's the question of that $300 asking price. Ultimately, bar a few minor details (a heart rate monitor here, an ambient light sensor there), you're getting pretty much the same experience whichever Wear watch you choose. The parting of money will come down to two things: design preference and price. LG made the G Watch R nice to look at and more watch-like, so I have no complaints there. For now, the Android Wear throne hasn't been toppled, but Motorola might well have to shuffle over and make room for a neighbor. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android wear, g watch r, lg, mobilepostcross, review, smartwatch, uk-reviews, video \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20985613 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20985613\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android-wear/\"> Google Android Wear </a> Google Android Wear Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android-wear/\" title=\"Google Android Wear reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Type Mobile / embedded OS Source model Open Released 2014-07-07 see all specs \u2192 7average user rating Ease of use 8 Speed 4 Configurability 2 Ecosystem (apps, drivers, etc.) 10 Openness 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 0 Moto 360 Pricing 0 Smartwatch that keeps the calendar locally? 2 Best Must Have Apps For Android Wear Talk about the Google Android Wear with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lg/g-watch/r/\"> LG G Watch R </a> LG G Watch R Buy from $299 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lg/g-watch/r/\" title=\"LG G Watch R reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 5 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Other Operating system Android Screen size 1.3 inches Storage type Internal storage (4 GB, Flash) Announced 2014-08-27 see all specs \u2192 8.6average user rating Features 8 Display 9.2 Battery life 8.4 Ease of use 8.4 Storage capacity 7.6 Design and form factor 9.6 Portability (size / weight) 10 Durability 8.4 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $299.99 + tax & shipping Buy now $303.72 + tax & shipping Buy now 0 Best Smartwatches: Upcoming/Available LG, Apple,Pebble Talk about the LG G Watch R with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 lab.scriptBs('gravity.js') onBreak({ 0: function(){}, 320: function(){}, 768: function(){} }); ", "title": "LG G Watch R review: good looks and improved battery are a step in the right direction"},

But while the Fire TV sounded like a real winner on paper, in practice it was more of a mixed bag. For round two, the internet retail giant scaled back its ambitions and the price. The Fire TV Stick is a streaming dongle similar to the Chromecast or Roku Streaming Stick that's focused mainly on serving up video and less on gaming. Plus, the $39 price tag dramatically lowers the bar for entry. But, even at less than half the price, the Fire TV Stick would be a hard pill to swallow if Amazon didn't iron out some of the kinks from its first-generation device. So has a few more months of polish addressed our concerns about Fire OS on the big screen? Without giving too much away, the answer is mostly yes. Gallery | 11 Photos Amazon Fire TV Stick review + See all 11 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 83 Amazon Fire TV Stick Pros Unobtrusive design Vastly improved onscreen keyboard Dedicated Prime Video section List of apps keeps getting longer Cons Still no HBO Go Included remote lacks voice search button Still some rough edges and inconsistencies in Fire OS Summary The Fire TV Stick addresses a number of issues we had with the Fire TV and comes with a much smaller price tag. It's not dramatically better than its competitors, but it's certainly not any worse. For $39, it's a perfectly viable streaming-media option, and the best one if you've already bought into Amazon's ecosystem. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware What is there to say about the hardware on the Fire TV Stick? It's a tiny, matte black device, barely larger than a thumb drive. It's unassuming to an extreme. It lacks the distinctive bulb shape of the Chromecast or the garish purple paint job of the Roku Streaming Stick. Really, it's what's under the hood that matters. Amazon managed to cram a dual-core CPU and VideoCore4 GPU inside this little dongle, not to mention 8GB of storage and a host of wireless radios. This isn't the same beastly hardware found inside the full-sized Fire TV, but it's definitely a step up from devices like the Roku Streaming Stick or the Chromecast. It's capable of not just pumping out HD video, but also powering some basic games... with an emphasis on \"basic.\" That means marathon sessions of Sev Zero at 60 frames per second are a no-go, but Badlands shouldn't be an issue. The Fire TV Stick is unassuming to an extreme. The Fire TV Stick also borrows the rather minimal remote design from its big brother. It also is mostly matte black, with a directional ring, three \"Android\" buttons and three keys for media control. Though it skews toward the smaller side, and loses some nice features in the process. The one easily forgivable, though unfortunate, trade-off is the loss of the groove on the underside. On the full-size Fire TV remote, there's a depression where you finger naturally rests, which makes for some lovely ergonomics. The version included here has a uniform, trapezoidal silhouette with rounded edges that still feels nice in the hand; just not quite as nice as its big brother. More importantly, though, the Fire TV Stick's remote lacks the built-in microphone for voice search. That means if you want to enjoy the fruits of Amazon's powerful search tool, you'll have to install the Fire TV Remote app, which is currently available on Android only. (On the bright side, it should be coming soon to iOS.) Your other option is to buy the separate Voice Remote for an additional $30. Still, at that point you might as well just buy the original Fire TV, which comes packaged with it. My one complaint is the placement of the micro-USB power port. Rather than being on the end, like it is on the Fire TV Stick's competitors, it's on the side. This means you might have to rearrange the HDMI cables on your TV if you've got a few things plugged in. Hardly a dealbreaker, but it did mean retraining myself to remember that my Xbox is now HDMI 4 instead of 1. Software Ultimately, the undoing of the Fire TV was its rather unpolished software experience. The carousel UI that worked so well on tablets didn't translate so nicely to the television. Plus, there were some truly questionable design decisions, like the A-Z, carousel-style onscreen keyboard. Things have gotten a bit better since April. There are still some kinks to be worked out, for sure, but what barely felt beta-quality just a few months ago now seems like a reasonably polished platform. You might think that a new onscreen keyboard would be a minor tweak, but here it's a huge deal For one, the carousel keyboard has been banished. You might think that a new onscreen keyboard would be a minor tweak, but here it's a huge deal, especially since Amazon has shifted away somewhat from voice search. The previous onscreen keyboard made non-voice searches so painful that we simply couldn't recommend it to anyone with a speech impediment or heavy accent. It's still not perfect -- in some areas the keyboard has a QWERTY layout; in some places it's ABC -- but it's definitely light-years better than what shipped with the Fire TV. Gallery | 21 Photos Amazon Fire TV Stick UI + See all 21 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") There's also finally a section that lets you browse only the videos available for free through Amazon Prime. Previously, movies and TV shows that required you to pay for them were mixed in with the ones available as part of your Prime subscription and there was no way to quickly identify which was which, without clicking through to the media's main page. Thankfully, this glaring oversight has been fixed and the Prime Video section gives you quick access to all the media that your Prime subscription pays for -- if you have a Prime subscription, that is. (And honestly, if you don't, why do you even want a Fire TV Stick?) There's finally a section that lets you browse only the videos available for free through Prime. Most of the other software tweaks are under the hood. ASAP, the name of Amazon's intelligent pre-caching tech, is still hit and miss. Occasionally movies and TV shows start immediately, without even a hint of a loading screen. But more often than not, you'll still be greeted with a brief buffering page. Still, the UI seems smoother than it was a few months ago and apps crash much less often. Even so, it's still not quite as responsive as the Roku Streaming Stick (which is no speed demon to be clear). I largely chalk that up to the more complex software running on it. Amazon's forked version of Android is likely more resource-intensive than the stripped-down, Linux-based software running on the Roku. Visually, Fire OS on the TV still looks like Fire OS on the TV. There are rows of rectangular icons on the right and categories stacked vertically on the left. It's clean, if not always efficient, and more often than not, intuitive enough for even your great-grandmother to navigate (we know you got grandma on the Roku bandwagon years ago). It still gives priority to content hosted on Amazon, which is to be expected. Searching for content pulls it up first from Amazon's repository, even if you have to pay for it. While select additional options, such as Hulu Plus, are buried in the \"More Ways to Watch\" menu. Most importantly for the platform, though, is that Amazon's put a serious dent in its app and content gap. Plenty of games have been added to its lineup and new streaming music and video services are joining the Fire TV party all the time, like PBS. The one glaring omission remains HBO Go, which is supposedly coming next year, though no specific time frame has been given. The competition One of the many things that the Fire TV Stick does not lack is competitors. The two most obvious are the Roku Streaming Stick and the Chromecast. If your primary concern is having the most sources of content at your disposal, then Roku is the clear winner. It's the only one of the three with access to both Google Play's library of video and Amazon's. And that's in addition to other major players, like Hulu, Netflix, Watch ESPN, HBO Go and Spotify, plus the countless independent niche channels like horror film-specific Screambox or the aptly named Kung-Fu Theater. The only serious mark against it is price, which, at $50, is notably more expensive than either the Chromecast or Fire TV Stick. Google's offering is certainly the simplest of the three. And, whether that's a benefit or a hindrance depends on your perspective. There's no remote and no menu to navigate. Instead, you have to send content directly from your phone to your TV. The other devices support this to varying degrees, but it's the heart and soul of the Chromecast. This feature isn't limited to your Netflix or Hulu app, however. It also supports simple games, even multiplayer ones, like Wheel of Fortune and Big Web Quiz. Also, you can mirror the screen on your Android phone or tablet, or even a tab from the Chrome browser. Plus, at $35, it's the cheapest of the bunch. Wrap-up With the Fire TV Stick, Amazon seems to have a winner on its hands. It does everything you expect a media streamer to do with little fuss and a reasonable price tag. Whereas the Fire TV toyed a little too much with the idea of being a game console and demanded top dollar, its little sibling focuses solely on delivering content. If you're already invested in the Amazon ecosystem, there's no reason not to give the Fire TV Stick serious consideration when shopping for a media streamer. It's got you covered when it comes to most of your major video services and it's still capable of some casual gaming. You can even connect a Bluetooth gamepad if you want to get a little more serious. With the Fire TV Stick, Amazon seems to have a winner on its hands. That being said, it's not the clear king of the hill. For $10 more, you can get the Roku with its seemingly bottomless pit of content, or you can save $5 and get the Chromecast, which can turn your TV into a giant external monitor for your phone. The price difference among these competitors, however, is not really enough to sway me one way or the other. It's mostly about whether you've bought into an ecosystem already. If you're married to iTunes, then clearly the Apple TV is for you. If you've built up a library on Google Play, then pick the Chromecast. If you've already got a home filled with Fire tablets, then obviously the Fire TV Stick is the route to go. And if you prefer to remain as agnostic as possible, then buy a Roku. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: amazon, fire tv, fire tv stick, hdpostcross, review, streaming, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21001746 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21001746\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/amazon/fire/tv/\"> Amazon Fire TV </a> Amazon Fire TV Buy from $96 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/amazon/fire/tv/\" title=\"Amazon Fire TV reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 5 </a> Prices Discussions Type Audio / video player Video services Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Other Audio services Pandora, Other Video codec support h.264 / AVC, MPEG-4, VC-1 Audio codec support AAC, MP3 Video outputs HDMI (1\u00a0outputs, v1.4) Audio outputs TOSLINK (optical) Released 2014-04-02 see all specs \u2192 8.6average user rating Media support 7.6 Video quality 9.6 Audio quality 9.2 Ease of use 8.4 Design and form factor 8.4 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 BLINQ $96.99 + tax & shipping Buy now $99.00 + tax & shipping Buy now 8 Amazon's new Fire TV 6 Amazon Fire TV apps 36 What do you want to know about Amazon's Fire TV?

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/09/16/iphone-6-and-6-plus-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "September 16th 2014 at 9:00 pm", "body": " To say that Apple's doing things differently would be an understatement. With the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, the company introduced two new high-end phones at the same time, both with a complete redesign and a much larger screen size than any iPhone that came before. Gone are the days of 3.5-inch and 4-inch phones that, at one time, seemed to provide more than ample amounts of screen space. Now, the new iPhones make their predecessors look like the tiny handset Ben Stiller used in Zoolander. The market has changed, and it was high time Apple did the same. Even though this is Apple's first attempt at building large phones, it's not breaking new ground -- in fact, it feels more like the company is catching up than innovating. To be fair, finding a fresh take is a difficult thing to do in this crowded space: Samsung's Galaxy Note series, which started out at 5.3 inches and is now up to 5.7, is selling by the millions, and most competing flagships aren't much smaller. Basically, Apple would be leaving money on the table if it didn't address this segment of the market. So how did the company do on its first try at large phones? Pretty well -- mostly. Gallery | 9 Photos The iPhone family + See all 9 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 90 Apple iPhone 6 Pros Sleek new design Great display Comfortable to hold Fast performance Generally good camera Cons Battery life could be better Lacks optical image stabilization NFC can only be used for mobile payments Summary Even with a slightly larger screen, the iPhone remains comfortable to hold. With fast performance, a great display, an elegant new design and a much-needed software update, it's one of the best smartphones you can buy right now. We wish it had the same long battery life as the iPhone 6 Plus (not to mention its optical image stabilization) but even then, the iPhone 6 is still the better choice for most people.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") 87 Apple iPhone 6 Plus Pros Large, beautiful display Great camera with optical image stabilization Long battery life Fast performance Cons One-handed use is frustrating and uncomfortable NFC can only be used for mobile payments Summary The iPhone 6 Plus is difficult to use one-handed, not to mention more uncomfortable than similar-sized phones. In exchange, though, you get more of an iPad-like user experience on a much smaller device. It also has better battery life than the smaller iPhone 6, as well as a better camera. Keep that in mind as you're deciding between the two devices. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Aside from the screen size and a few minor hardware differences, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are identical. Unlike Apple's last four flagships (the 4 to the 5s), which sported a squarish, blocky shape, the 6 series features soft, rounded sides. Not counting the glass screen, the entire frame is constructed of aluminum, similar to the material Apple uses on its MacBooks. As you'll see in my iOS 8 review, Apple's following a design approach centered on \"continuity\" -- the idea that its products should work seamlessly with each other. This is evident in the iPhone 6's hardware as well. The 5 and 5s had straight sides that met the front and back via chamfered edges. On the 6, Apple opted for a unibody build; the bubbled-out sides and flat back are constructed from one continuous piece of material. Meanwhile, the front glass panel tapers down ever so slightly at the edge, producing an uninterrupted look. I'll always have a soft spot for the chamfered edges on the 5 and 5s, but the 6 and 6 Plus feel fresh, especially after years of only modest design tweaks. Gallery | 26 Photos iPhone 6 Plus review + See all 26 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Gallery | 18 Photos iPhone 6 review + See all 18 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Both iPhones are thinner than their predecessor. Whereas the 5s was 7.6mm thick, the 6 comes in at 6.9mm, with the 6 Plus measuring a hair thicker at 7.1mm. I don't always subscribe to the \"thinner is better\" mantra, but it's a benefit in this case because larger iPhones wouldn't feel as comfortable if they had the same shape as the 5s. If I had to choose based on in-hand feel alone, I'd pick the 6 over the Plus. I can still wrap my fingers around the 6 just as easily as I could with the 5s (and its curved sides don't cut as sharply as the edges on the 5s), but the large-screened 6 Plus is... well, it's manageable. There's no avoiding it: The Plus is even bigger than it looks. It's easier to acclimate to the Plus if you're already used to large phones, but even then, this is a massive piece of kit. Let's do a close comparison with the 5.7-inch Samsung Galaxy Note 3, for instance (I have a review unit handy, and the unreleased Note 4 has similar dimensions). The Plus is nearly 7mm taller, 1.4mm narrower and 1.2mm thinner than the Note. Both are huge, and their width can fatigue even the biggest of hands if you hold on long enough. When you have a big handset, your fingers need to secure a firm grip; the Note's straight, ridged sides and textured back make for a relatively easy grip. With the 6 Plus, though, those narrow, rounded edges feel sharper when the tips of your fingers are grasping on for dear life, and the aluminum is slipperier. I got used to the design, but it takes time. Gallery | 7 Photos iPhone 6 versus the Galaxy Note 3 + See all 7 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") But a phone's screen size doesn't have to dictate how large the device itself is. Take the LG G3, a 5.5-inch phone with the exact opposite in-hand feel. Compared with the LG G3, the Plus is nearly 12mm taller, 3.2mm wider and 1.8mm thinner; LG's large-screened option has a smaller bezel and arched back that fit the natural contours of my hand extremely well. It feels much more comfortable to hold for long periods of time, and I never worry about it slipping out of my hands. Both the 6 and 6 Plus use an IPS Retina HD display, but the Plus is even more high-def than the 6. It has a screen resolution of 1,920 x 1,080, which means you'll get a pixel density of 401 pixels per inch. On the flipside, the 6 maxes out at 1,334 x 750, which translates into 326 ppi. (That's the same screen density as the 5s.) Both displays are sharp, but I do see some minor differences between the two when I look at them side by side. Specifically, the Plus' text and images are sharper, with no jagged lines whatsoever. That said, I don't think it's enough to steer you from one device to the other; they both look fantastic from a few inches away. Additionally, the color representation on both phones is less saturated than the Super AMOLED panel on the Note 3, and is extremely close to the colors on a Retina display MacBook Pro. With the Retina HD display, Apple is also introducing what it's calling \"dual-domain pixels,\" which arrange the display's subpixels into a chevron-like pattern designed to compensate for the contrast that normally shows up when you look at the screen from oblique angles. It also helps produce deeper darks and sharper text; both new iPhones have brighter whites than the 5s, but the Plus has the warmest tint of the three. The viewing angles are indeed among the best I've seen, and it's great to see Apple incorporate this technology into its latest products. All that said, it's worth noting that while Apple makes this screen technology sound brand-new, it's actually been used before on phones like the HTC One M7 and the One X. Over the years, Apple's continued to fine-tune its reputation for building devices that combine solid build quality with a premium design. While these new iPhones generally continue that tradition, there are a couple quirks that are difficult to un-see. The first is the excessive use of antenna lines on the back. The two stripes stretching across the top and bottom sections enhance the look of the phone's rear -- much like the HTC One series -- but there are two unsightly lines that follow the upper and lower perimeter, and they stick out like a sore thumb. Secondly, though the phones got thinner, the camera module did not; the result is a lens that sticks out from the rest of the chassis, which increases the likelihood of the casing and lens getting scratched. I am, of course, nitpicking. After all, an aluminum phone needs to have openings for antennas to get a signal, and that's precisely what the stripes on the sides and back do. Unfortunately, though, they do detract from the device's beauty, not enhance it. As for the camera, many flagship phones come with tiny humps around the camera module to compensate for the extra depth they require, but I would've rather seen Apple go with a design that's less severe. (Update: A few folks have rightly pointed out that the lens is sapphire, so scratches shouldn't be an issue. Still, its prominence compared to the rest of the chassis remains a design distraction.) One final concern: The phones are prone to scratches if you're not careful. After just a day of use, I started noticing a few small marks on the backs of both devices. The most extreme thing I did to the phones during this time was slide them around on an office table. Granted, a case will resolve all of these issues, but unfortunately, cases also add a fair amount of bulk, and I've always preferred showing off my phones in all their beauty. NFC Apple's coming out with a mobile payment service in October called Apple Pay. I haven't been able to test it out yet, so I'll revisit that when it becomes available. Once it's up and running, it'll use a wireless standard known as Near-Field Communications (NFC) that comes built into the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. In short, a transmitter on your device can communicate with a receiver located just a few millimeters away; this is incredibly useful for mobile payment transactions because the short distance makes it more secure than any other wireless connection, so you don't have to worry about a third party getting unauthorized access to your sensitive information. Since NFC is a standard, the iPhone is theoretically capable of doing a lot more than just mobile payments -- tap-to-pair for Bluetooth devices, unlocking doors and hotel rooms, mobile tickets for public transit, Foursquare check-ins, et cetera. For now, though, the iPhone's NFC radio will be limited just to Apple Pay; developers can't do anything with it right now. Apple hasn't said if this will change in the future, but I suspect the company is approaching it with the same timidity as it did with Touch ID; Apple initially used it just to unlock the iPhone and approve iTunes purchases, and now, a year later, it's finally opening up the sensor for developer support. Software Both iPhones come preloaded with iOS 8. You can find my in-depth review of the update here, so I won't go into much detail in this review. But there are a few specific software features on the 6 and 6 Plus worth revisiting. Apple is treating the Plus as a small iPad mini (mini iPad mini?) of sorts: The springboard now can switch into landscape mode, and a few of the native apps (Mail, Calendar and Messages) come with dual-pane windows. This is a great use of the extra screen space, and it gives the Plus a clear productivity advantage over the 6. While I'm on the subject of landscape mode, the keyboard also looks rather different. The standard keyboard shows up directly in the middle and is flanked by heaps of symbols and other options. Arrows and many of the popular punctuation marks are on the right, while options like copy and paste, undo and voice dictation are on the left. Both iPhones also feature Display Zoom, which magnifies the screen and makes your icons, text and other materials larger. There's one-handed mode, which Apple refers to as \"Reachability.\" This is technically available on both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but it makes the most sense on the larger model. Since it's tough to stretch your tiny fingers all the way to the top of the screen, Apple's solution is to bring the screen down to you. When you double-tap on the Touch ID button, the entire UI slides down so the top half of the app is located on the bottom half of the screen. You can scroll and interact with it just like you normally could in full-screen mode, but in case you need to get to a link at the bottom of a website, or you're trying to get down to the end of an email, you'll have to go back out to see the entire screen. It's better than having no one-handed mode at all, but it still feels cumbersome and I only really used it when I wasn't able to use two hands (e.g., when I'm walking down the street while holding a bag). It may sound like the Plus isn't ideal, and indeed, it's not for everyone. But for many, the additional screen real estate is worth sacrificing some one-handed comfort. Not only do you get more rows of icons on each screen (the 5s is 6 x 4, while the 6 is 7 x 4 and the 6 Plus is 7 x 4 with slightly larger icons and more space in between), but you're also going to be able to see more emails, tweets, Google search results, Engadget posts, calendar appointments and, well... more of everything. More screen space equates to more room for consuming, creating and manipulating content, and since it's still small enough to fit in most jeans pockets (provided they're not too tight), it's still more portable than any iPad. Camera While the megapixel war rages on among manufacturers like Sony, Samsung, LG and Microsoft Devices (Nokia), Apple doesn't seem to feel compelled to join the fray. Instead, it's sticking with a modest 8MP iSight camera similar to the one found n the 5s. Although the aperture and pixel size haven't changed, Apple's added \"Focus Pixels,\" which is the company's fancy term for Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF). The tech is used in many DSLRs and phones like the Galaxy S5, and the idea is to lock autofocus faster. Fortunately, Focus Pixels doesn't disappoint; in several side-by-side shots in which my goal was to snap a photo as quickly as possible, the 6 and 6 Plus did considerably better at producing focused images. In case you need extra perks for going with the larger device, the Plus comes with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). This feature is designed to reduce the amount of blur that can come from the natural shaking of your hand, and it produces better low-light performance as a result. I took several nighttime shots with the 6 and 6 Plus side by side, and although there was no difference in how much light the cameras took in, the images from the Plus consistently came out sharper -- both when viewing at standard size and especially when zoomed in. I also pitted the Plus head to head against several other flagships. It bested the HTC One M8 in sharpness and white balance, though it didn't get quite as much light; it had more natural colors and less noise than the LG G3; it got more light, better colors and clearer focus than the Galaxy S5; and although the Lumia 1020 brought in the most light, it also did so at the expense of unnatural colors and noise. Gallery | 80 Photos iPhone 6 Plus sample shots + See all 80 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Gallery | 85 Photos iPhone 6 sample shots + See all 85 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") So the iPhone 6 Plus held its own against nearly every major flagship in terms of low-light images, but how did it (and its 4.7-inch twin) fare in the daylight? Shots taken by the Lumia 1020 were far more detailed and had a slightly more accurate white balance and color representation outside; but while it did a fantastic job capturing the shadows, the highlights were typically more blown out than they were on the iPhone. The GS5 is a respectable contender in the daylight as well, offering more detail, but the iPhone generally produced more accurate colors. The G3 appears to be overexposed by default and the dynamic range is not as wide, so shadows are incredibly dark and whites are slightly blown out. Finally, the iPhone bested the HTC One in dynamic range, detail and color. The iPhone camera may not always be the best in every circumstance, but it's consistently near the top in almost every scenario. The autofocus locks quickly; each shot contains all of the detail you'll need (unless you have to zoom in incredibly far); dynamic range is great; and color representation is sound. And although there weren't a lot of drastic improvements to the new iPhone cameras over the 5s, I know that if I need to snap a quick picture, it's going to turn out well. (Note: Full-res images are now available: iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. I also have uploaded albums with samples from other flagship devices.) Performance and battery life Last year, Apple rocked the boat by announcing that the iPhone 5s would be the first phone with 64-bit support, thanks to its A7 chip. This year's bump to an A8 chipset isn't quite as dramatic, but the company is claiming that the chip comes with a 25 percent uptick in CPU performance and 50 percent in GPU output. It packs 2 billion transistors, which is a number that few other companies boast in product launches; by comparison, Intel's Haswell desktop processor has around 1.4 billion. Apple seldom dives into more specifics, but benchmarks reveal that we're looking at a 1.4GHz dual-core processor. I get why Apple would rather discuss the experience than the actual numbers -- it's because a 1.4GHz dual-core chipset with 1GB RAM doesn't sound as good as a 2.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon or an octa-core MediaTek with 2 or 3GB RAM. But I've never had any problems getting iPhones to handle heavy loads, and the 6 and 6 Plus are no different. Games load and run smoothly and multitasking works great. When it comes to benchmarking, it can be difficult to compare Apples to Androids. There are a few cross-platform tests, however, so I decided to take a look and see how the iPhone 6 holds up to a pair of Snapdragon 801-powered flagships, the Galaxy S5 and the HTC One M8. As you can see below, the iPhone does better in some areas and worse in others. On SunSpider, it produced the best scores I've seen on any smartphone. It does well on single-threaded activities in Geekbench and keeps up with the Snapdragon in multi-threaded tests. It does significantly better in Basemark X, but not in 3DMark. The long and short of it is that you shouldn't feel like switching from one flagship phone to another simply because it has more cores; Apple holds its own against the strongest competition, and it still has the advantage of having 64-bit support on both hardware and firmware for at least a short period of time -- at least, until Android L comes out and more chipsets integrate 64-bit support. iPhone 5s iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus 3Dmark Unlimited IS 14,899 16,689 17,902 Geekbench 3 (multi-thread) 2477 2885 2803 Basemark X 14,404 15,572 16,538 SunSpider 1.0 (ms) 449 351 388 SunSpider: lower scores are better The iPhone 6 series also comes with an upgraded motion coprocessor called the M8, which adds barometer support in addition to the accelerometer, gyroscope and compass. Since barometers can sense the variance in air pressure, this means you can now measure changes in elevation. Those measurements, in turn, will get added to the new iOS Health app. Another interesting side effect of the size difference is how they manage thermal heat dissipation. Since it's the smaller of the two, the iPhone 6 got noticeably toastier than the Plus when playing games -- in fact, I rarely had any problem with the Plus getting warm. If you're having trouble choosing between the 6 and its extra-large twin, battery life may be the ultimate deciding factor. It's no secret that the Plus comes with a larger battery and therefore longer runtime than the 6, but how much of a difference will it make? Turns out, a noticeable one. In our video-playback tests, the 6 lasted 10 hours and 19 minutes; that's actually worse than the 5s results from last year, which managed to go for 10:50. The iPhone 6 Plus, on the other hand, still had 14 percent battery left when the 6 died. All told, it lasted almost 12 hours. Both of these results are lower than Apple's claims, but likely are the outcomes of different testing methods. But tests are tests: Real-world performance is where it's at. And this is where the Plus truly shines. In my usage tests, I do a little bit of everything on the phone: calls, games, email, social networking, e-book reading, the works. After all that, I got through a full 17-hour workday with just 3 or 4 percent battery life remaining. On the 6, I managed to squeak out around 13 hours. With moderate to light usage, you should expect to see the Plus get roughly a day and a half, if not more. (Update: iFixit tore down the iPhones and discovered that the battery on the Plus is 2,915mAh, while the 6 is 1,810mAh.) Both iPhones come in two versions with different sets of wireless frequencies, so you'll want to be aware of the differences. The first option comes with support for 16 LTE bands, while the second takes the same 16 and adds four more bands for a total of 20. This is the most I've ever seen included in one specific model. I usually list out which bands are covered on which devices, but let's face it: If the 20-band option doesn't include your specific needs, very few other phones likely will. The latter will ensure the most coverage globally, and will be sold in more places; in the US, however, you'll only find this version on Sprint and US Cellular. Every model will come with penta-band HSPA+ and quad-band GSM/EDGE, and there's also a CDMA variant that comes with those frequencies as well. The new iPhones also support WiFi calling with 802.11ac compatibility (in addition to the usual a/b/g/n), both of which have been a long time coming. WiFi calling, which offers high-quality phone calls over your wireless router, is a carrier-dependent feature. T-Mobile is the only network that currently supports it in the US, though AT&T plans to support it sometime next year. Meanwhile, 802.11ac compatibility ensures that your iPhone isn't a network bottleneck like it once was; its theoretical max speed is now 433 Mbps. Most customers don't get speeds this fast from their ISPs, but at least the speed limit is no longer low enough to have a negative impact on your internet experience. The competition At 4.7 inches, the iPhone 6 is still technically smaller than most modern-day flagships. Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 5.1 inches; the HTC One M8 is 5.0; the new Moto X is 5.2; and the LG G3 is 5.5, just to name a few. So if you pine for a top-of-the-line phone that's larger than the iPhone 5s, but smaller than any of the aforementioned heroes, the iPhone 6 will be a great fit. If you're looking at the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, however, the competition is fiercer -- at least, if you care less about the OS and more about what you can do with the screen size. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is coming early next month, and since it'll have a 5.7-inch Quad HD display, it'll be a tad shorter, wider and thicker; however, it'll also have straight sides, which provide a firmer grip than the rounded edges on the 6 Plus. You can also get the LG G3, which has a higher-resolution 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Heck, if you're extremely adventurous, you could get a Lumia 1520, which is a 6-inch Windows Phone with even sharper edges than the Plus. Eventually, both iPhones will be available globally, but it's only coming to a handful of countries at launch. Each one will come in three color choices (space gray, silver and gold) and three storage sizes: 16GB, 64GB and 128GB. The latter storage option is the most I've seen built into a smartphone (internally, at least) though the mid-tier should be plenty for most users -- especially now that it's doubled in size. The iPhone 6 will start at $199 on-contract ($649 retail) for 16GB, and go up to $299 ($749) and $399 ($849) for the 64GB and 128GB models, respectively. The iPhone 6 Plus is $100 more than its smaller sibling, so prices start at $299 ($749) and go up to $499 ($949). Wrap-up For the first time, iPhone fans can enjoy something Android users have taken for granted: choice. Until this year, buying a high-end iPhone wasn't a tough decision. You either bought it or you didn't. Now there are two to choose from, and while they look identical, each has its own set of trade-offs that you need to weigh: The 4.7-inch iPhone 6 features a respectable display size and a comfortable in-hand fit; it's also my personal favorite after using both for several days. The 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, on the flipside, isn't as easy to hold in one hand, but you'll want it if you're hoping to get an iPad-like phone with great battery life and a lot more screen real estate. This year's iPhones aren't groundbreaking, nor are they perfect. But they demonstrate something far more important to Apple's success in the long run: freshness. Apple ditched the tried-and-true square design (which I've always been fond of) for a more rounded, modern look; it added features that should've been there ages ago (NFC, anyone?); and it made the phones large enough to start competing in a hotly contested space. No doubt about it, the iPhone needed to grow in size and function, and it did just that. Fortunately, it made the leap before it was too late. Photos by Will Lipman.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2015/02/25/withings-activate-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "February 25th 2015 at 2:00 pm", "body": " Forget notifications, forget apps, forget all of the noisy little distractions masquerading as help -- sometimes a wearable is at its best when it stays out of your way. As it turns out, that's just what French hardware house Withings had in mind when it built the Activit\u00e9 ($450) and Activit\u00e9 Pop ($150). In addition to that, though, these fitness bands have something perhaps even more important going for them: With their round faces and classic dials, they don't actually look like activity trackers. Indeed, they're not quite traditional fitness devices, nor are they full-on smartwatches, and I sort of love them for it. Just know that one of them probably isn't for you. 75 Withings Activit\u00c3\u00a9 Pros Beautiful design and materials Step counter works well Easy-to-understand user interface Cons Hefty price tag Companion app lacks polish Limited functionality Summary If you're looking for a wearable that's as much a status symbol as it is a piece of gear, consider the $450 Withings Activit\u00e9. The entire thing is hewn of premium materials (think stainless steel, calfskin leather and sapphire crystal), but its lovely looks are offset by its inability to do anything beyond tell time and count steps. You won't feel embarrassed wearing it, but you will feel poorer. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") 77 Withings Activit\u00c3\u00a9 Pop Pros Reasonably\u00a0priced Step counter works well Darker finish hides dings better Cons Functionality still limited Silicone band can be uncomfortable Band collects dust and dirt App needs work Summary Don't be fooled its the lower price tag: There's nothing the premium Activit\u00e9 can do that the less expensive Pop can't. There aren't any high-end materials here, but the end result is a wearable that looks great, tracks steps with ease and won't make your wallet weep. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware The Activit\u00e9 is by far the pricier of the two watches, at $450, with two versions available. Our review unit came with a black, calfskin leather strap and a black face, offset by a few red-orange touches like the secondary step-counting hand. Not quite your style? There's also a model with a brown band and surprisingly handsome blue trim. (This is the one I would buy; the white face and blue accents look great together.) Both versions are better suited to strutting around town than tearing up a treadmill, but the included silicone strap helps them pull gym duty when needed. I'm glad Withings included it, but two things kept me from using it more: The default leather band looks way sharper, and my wrist tended to get uncomfortably moist under the plastic band. If the Activit\u00e9 aspires to the elegant, understated charm of a Montblanc Heritage Chronom\u00e9trie or a Piaget Altiplano, then the Activit\u00e9 Pop falls squarely in Swatch territory. That's hardly a bad thing, per se; it does everything the premium version can, just in a less expensive, more colorful body. The Pop trades the leather for a utilitarian silicone strap, which pops on and off with the same dead-simple latch system. That downgrade in build materials is all that sets the Pop apart from its stablemate; the body is made of a darker, PVD-treated stainless steel instead of the Activit\u00e9's shiny alloy, and the hands are made of plastic. As for the glass dome covering the face, the Pop's is made of mineral glass, as opposed to scratchproof sapphire, which you'll find on the higher-end model. All told, the Pop was a little less comfortable to wear for long periods of time, largely thanks to that silicone strap, but you'll be fine if you don't suffer from Sweaty Wrist Syndrome. Gallery | 20 Photos Withings Activit\u00c3\u00a9 and Activit\u00c3\u00a9 Pop review + See all 20 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") The Activit\u00e9's raison d'\u00eatre is that colorful second hand perched under the primary one. As you go about your day, it'll slowly sweep around a smaller dial to show you how many steps you've taken so far. Your baseline goal is set to 10,000 steps by default, a target you can change in Withings' companion app if you're feeling ambitious. That's really it. The Activit\u00e9 aspires to very little, but Withings (rightfully, I think) cares more about execution than dazzling you with superfluous features. There is one neat little addition, though. To check what time your alarm is set for, just double-tap the Activit\u00e9's face; that'll prompt its hands to dance around the clock and stop at your chosen time. It's a lovely little touch that floored everyone I showed it to... when it decided to work, anyway. Sometimes a couple pokes with my index finger was enough to do the trick; other times I had to knock it with my knuckle. On several occasions it didn't work at all, which made me look just brilliant in front of my friends. When the first images of the waterproof Activit\u00e9 started making the rounds, I hoped for a big, beautiful Moto 360-sized dial breaking down my day's movement. What we actually got was a pair of watch faces just over an inch in diameter, which made them feel a touch delicate on my slim wrists. This is a totally minor annoyance; Withings made the decision with both genders in mind, but I can't help but think a larger, more substantial design would have been awesome. C'est la vie. You'd expect a fitness-friendly wearable to come with some sort of clunky charger, but Withings managed to sidestep that little necessity. Both watches are powered by a humble button-cell battery, the sort that used to be RadioShack's bread and butter before RadioShack stopped being a thing. Withings promises the battery can last through eight months of use before you need to schlep out and buy a replacement. I'll update this review if that turns out not to be the case. Software Since the Activit\u00e9 and Activit\u00e9 Pop don't do much by themselves, it's up to their companion app -- Withings Health Mate -- to pick up some slack. Think of it as the display the watches themselves don't have. Once you've programmed your height, weight and fitness goals, you're dropped into a timeline that neatly combines all your heart rate, movement and sleep data into a single feed. It works well enough, but the whole thing can be tough to parse at a glance with all the numbers and tiny graphs filling up the screen. Then again, if you fancy yourself a data-visualization nerd, you'll find plenty to like here. Speaking of data, the Activit\u00e9s try to collect plenty of it. By far, Health Mate's neatest trick is using your iPhone's camera to check your heart rate. It's actually an ingenious little feature: With a bit of help from the LED flash, the app detects your pulse through the skin of your finger when you stick it on top of the camera. Out of curiosity, I pitted the feature against the Microsoft Band to see how it stacked up against a wearable with a built-in heart rate monitor. The results: The race was surprisingly tight. Microsoft's wristband gave me an up-to-the-minute readout of my pulse that was always just between one and three beats per minute off from what Withings' app reported every time I tried them. The problem is, since it requires the brightness of the flash to penetrate your skin, trying to measure your pulse in a bright room doesn't always work. Your environs don't even need to be that bright to throw things off: I tried this feature on a New York City subway under some middling fluorescent lights, and still had no luck. Gallery | 14 Photos Withings Health Mate app review + See all 14 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Part of me bristles at the idea of wearing something on my wrist while I sleep, but the Activit\u00e9s mostly did a fine job of tallying up my restful (and restless) hours in bed. My sleep schedule has been all kinds of terrible lately: I'll sleep for three or four hours in the middle of the night, only to pass out again when I'm done working for the day. Still, it somehow never fully sunk in how terrible my sleep quality was. In fact, the app sometimes seems a little too pessimistic, which led to inevitable questions about accuracy -- some nights I could've sworn I got more sleep than what the app was reporting. (How restful it was is a different story). After a while, a sort of philosophical dilemma arose. Does it really matter if a device/app combo like this isn't accurate all the time? After all, broad strokes are more helpful than none at all, right? Your mileage might vary, but in my case, the app just reinforced what I already knew: Sleep more, idiot. Before I start to sound too forgiving, know all is not well here. A couple of design decisions seem misguided. You earn badges for completing certain unseen challenges (like walking the equivalent of a marathon), but they only appear in your timeline -- not the profile page where you'd expect to see all your accomplishments laid out nice and neat. Fine, that's a minor one. Then there's the alarm clock. When you try to set an alarm for the watch, you do so by dragging a bar up and down the screen to select the time it'll go off. At first it's neat, but if you have to set an alarm for, say, eight hours from now, you have to carefully drag the slider to the edge of the screen and wait for it to cycle through the hours until it finally lands on the time you want it to. A text box wouldn't have been hard to implement, and it would've been so much easier. Withings may have made some lovely watches, but Jawbone and Fitbit still lead the pack when it comes to app design and stability. Bring on the updates, people -- you can do better. The competition Withings' two-pronged approach might seem savvy, but it's not the only one with a wearable for all-comers. Fitbit may be the biggest example, and it's nipping at Withings from all sides with devices like the Flex and the Surge. If you're the sort who just instinctively reaches for a phone when you need the time, the $100 Flex might be up your alley; it'll track your steps and sleep like the Activit\u00e9s will, but its more ho-hum design and lack of a meaningful display help keep its price fairly low. Meanwhile, Fitbit's new Charge HR (which will or won't give you a rash) packs a built-in heart rate monitor and caller ID into a sleek bracelet that costs just as much as the Pop. Willing to shell out a little more? We loved the $200 Basis Peak, which rocks a slightly more traditional watch form factor, displays smartphone notifications and can automatically tell when you're working out or have gone to sleep. Then there's the Activit\u00e9. For the price it commands, you could splurge on a fancy Android Wear device; the LG G Watch R and Moto 360 both cost less and do plenty more, including step count. They're both some of your more stylish options too; though, the former definitely has a more masculine feel than either the Activit\u00e9 or the 360. The thing is, Withings is still working on Android compatibility for both watches so it'll be a little while before those are viable alternatives. The get-up-and-go types reading this might prefer Adidas' miCoach Smart Run, but let's be real: It's hardly a looker. If anything, the Activit\u00e9's closest rival just might be the base-level Apple Watch, which is slated to start at a lower price of $349 when it launches in April. Both wearables put a premium on design, though the Apple Watch's ability to do more makes it a potential Activit\u00e9 killer if ever there was one. Wrap-up I love the Activit\u00e9, but man is it a hard sell sometimes. If we take a moment to zoom out, it's exactly the sort of wearable I think people -- regular people -- would embrace. It's simple -- elegant, even. You can set it up through your phone and, in theory, never again touch the app (which could use some work, by the way). It adds just enough to a regular watch to be meaningful, without getting in your face about it. That said, the Activit\u00e9 isn't really meant for the average schlub. Watch nerds, aficionados, fetishists -- people who care deeply about what they put on their bodies and what it says about them -- might find its balance of quality and performance worth the $450 price. That's what makes the Activit\u00e9 Pop such a compelling option. It does everything its more expensive relative does and with a design that's (almost) as fetching, for a fraction of the price. It still might not do enough to satisfy people on the bleeding edge of tech, but it's a lovely place for the average person to start. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: activite, activitepop, FitnessTracker, review, uk-reviews, watch, watches, withings \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21145831 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21145831\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/withings/activite/\"> Withings Activit\u00c3\u00a9 </a> Withings Activit\u00c3\u00a9 Buy from $450 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/withings/activite/\" title=\"Withings Activit\u00c3\u00a9 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 2 </a> Prices Discussions Type Watch-style Tracking metrics Motion / steps, Distance, Calories, Sleep Announced 2014-06-24 see all specs \u2192 7.5average user rating Durability 9 Portability 9 Ease of use 8 Design and form factor 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $450.00 + tax & shipping Buy now No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/02/lumia-830-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "November 2nd 2014 at 1:00 pm", "body": " When Nokia released the Lumia Icon earlier this year, it took its polycarbonate design philosophy and went a bit metal -- aluminum, specifically. The result was a premium phone with a fancy body to match. But the Icon's exclusivity on Verizon limited its appeal, and its sibling, the Lumia 930, has yet to make it to US shores. Into that void comes the Lumia 830, from the freshly minted Microsoft Mobile. With the Lumia 830, priced at $100 with a two-year contract on AT&T ($450 contract-free), Microsoft looks to bring the metal frame and PureView camera branding of high-end Lumias down to the mid-range smartphone level. Of course, there's always the risk of making the wrong sacrifices when trying to lower the price, so did Microsoft shave too many corners off of the 830's aluminum body? I've spent the past week with the global version of the phone as my daily driver to find out. Gallery | 19 Photos Lumia 830 review + See all 19 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 80 Microsoft Lumia 830 Pros Solid aluminum frame Impressive, image-stabilized rear camera Good everyday performance Cons Struggles in some games Merely average front camera Quirky white balance (though pending updates may improve things) Summary The Lumia 830 strikes a good balance with its premium aluminum frame and mid-range internals. Those looking for a solid camera experience at this price range should take a good look. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware While the lower-tier Lumia 735/730 handsets stick to tried-and-true polycarbonate bodies, the Lumia 830 follows in the aluminum-ringed footsteps of the Icon and 930. A solid frame of metal surrounds the 830's squared-off body, interrupted by two pairs of thin plastic strips on the top and bottom edges (for the radio frequencies to pass through). At 139.4 x 70.7 x 8.5mm, it checks in at 2.4mm taller, 0.3mm narrower and 1.3mm thinner than its higher-end predecessors. Its 150g weight puts it 17 grams lighter as well. That metal frame is flanked on the front by a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 that rises slightly above the aluminum body. Thankfully, the display gently tapers at the edges, making for a smooth transition from the glass to the thin metal along the bezels. No sharp, abrupt borders here. Around back, a removable plastic cover allows access to the swappable battery as well as the nano-SIM and microSD slots. The latter of which supports up to 128GB cards to supplement the 16GB of onboard memory. (Sorry, no 32GB or higher model here.) The backplate puffs out even further from the aluminum frame than the front display, creating a curved rear that makes the phone actually quite comfortable in my palm despite the flat-sided aluminum frame. Its matte finish feels nice to the touch, while also resisting greasy fingerprints. If you're not a fan of my review unit's orange hue, there other colors to consider -- though the selection in the US may differ from what's offered elsewhere. Microsoft is also offering various colorful flip cover shells (with wireless charging support) if you'd like some extra protection. As for ports and buttons, the Lumia 830 mostly sticks to the standard set seen on many a Lumia over the years. On the right edge, you'll find a volume rocker near the top, a power key in the middle and a dedicated camera key toward the bottom. The headphone jack sits front and center along the top edge. I was somewhat surprised to find the micro-USB port up there as well (it's been on the bottom on most of my past phones). In regular use, I found that placement a bit tricky when I had the 830 mounted in a cradle in my car -- it was a bit odd to see a charging cable sprouting upward out of my phone. That said, there's always the built-in, Qi-compatible wireless charging if you find the charge port's location troublesome. The most notable feature on the rear, of course, is the Lumia 830's PureView camera module, located in the top-center of the backplate. Here, Microsoft Mobile mimics the look of the Lumia 1020's signature camera, with a black, circular panel surrounding the 830's 10-megapixel camera and LED flash. Of course, this is more \"inspiration\" than it is direct \"imitation.\" You won't find the 1020's massive, Ritz cracker-size main shooter protruding from the back. No, we're dealing with more modest equipment here, so the disc on the 830's rear is much smaller than its ancestor's. What's more, the removable cover adds a slight ridge around the rear camera, providing a bit of protection. Toward the bottom of the back panel is the 830's main speaker grille. While that location might not be as ideal as, say, the 1020's bottom-edge speaker, it's placed where the rear starts to taper, giving it a bit of breathing room when the phone is placed face-up on a table. While the 830 matches the 5-inch screen size of the Icon/930 line, Microsoft shed some pixels (and helped lower the price) by opting for a 1,280 x 720 display instead of a 1080p panel. We're also dealing with an IPS LCD here, rather than the AMOLED unit found on its older siblings. Whether that's a plus or a minus likely depends on how much you enjoy/detest AMOLED's highly saturated colors. I find the 830's screen pleasing for the most part, with accurate colors and good viewing angles in most directions. However, I did notice washed-out colors while watching movies at extreme positions, especially toward the lower left and right in landscape mode. Software Recent improvements to the Windows Phone OS have more or less put Microsoft's mobile offering on an even footing (as far as core features) with the likes of Android and iOS. The latest upgrades to WP8.1 include support for folders on the home screen, more options and languages for the Cortana voice assistant and faster browsing through Internet Explorer. In addition, Lumia models will be getting an update called \"Denim,\" which tacks on camera improvements, more options for the Glance Screen feature and voice activation on certain Lumia models (the Icon, the 930 and the 1520) -- just say, \"Hey, Cortana\" to fire up the voice assistant while the phone's idle. On top of those additions, the OS also boasts a solid notification center, home screen wallpapers and swiping support in the keyboard. The Lumia's Glance Screen, which offers the time, date and some notifications when the display is off, makes the 830 a perfect bedside alarm clock since it stays onscreen while the phone is charging. No more groggily trying to find your phone's power toggle in the middle of the night just to see how much time you got left to sleep. Out of the box, my unlocked review unit came with the standard Lumia offerings (including Here Drive, Skype and Mix Radio), as well as a smattering of third-party apps like Facebook and Flipboard. Thankfully, if you're not interested in any of the preloaded options, they're easy enough to uninstall to reclaim some storage space. Of course, it's not all great news. The continued additions to the OS (plus other, Lumia-specific features) have resulted in an unorganized and ungainly settings menu. The latest incarnation of WP's stock music player has you flicking upward on the album art to change tracks. After years of swiping right to left (since back in the Zune HD days), I'm finding this new gesture annoying and less intuitive. And then there's the app question. While the situation has greatly improved of late, there's still a chance your favorite app or game may not yet be offered on the platform. Beyond that, Google still refuses to offer official options for services like Gmail, Hangouts and YouTube. So if you're deeply integrated in Google's ecosystem, but prefer the feel of Windows Phone, you'll need to resort to third-party options like IM+ for Hangouts or Metrotube for YouTube. Of course, Microsoft offers its own suite of tools, like Office, OneNote and OneDrive, that play quite nicely with Windows Phone 8.1. You may consider alternative apps even when official support exists. Case in point: While there is a beta-tagged version of Instagram available, it lacks several editing tools seen on Android and iOS. Meanwhile, the third-party app 6tag offers some interesting options, like collages and letterboxing photos with wide aspect ratios to fit them in Instagram's square format. Whether that app deficit actually affects you depends, of course, on your specific needs. Can you get by without dedicated Gmail or YouTube apps? Will you be satisfied with an official Instagram app that's not yet as robust as its Android/iOS counterparts? Comfortable with resorting to third-party alternatives? I can't answer that for you, unfortunately. So if you are considering Windows Phone, be sure to check the app marketplace to know what you're getting yourself into. Camera With the Lumia 830, Microsoft isn't bringing just the design language of the Icon and 930 down to a lower price bracket. It's also placing the \"PureView\" badge on a more affordable option as well. Sure, the 830 doesn't boast the resolution of the 20MP Icon or 930, much less the Lumia 1020's 41 megapixels. Instead, it stakes its claim to the PureView name via optical image stabilization and the promise of improved responsiveness. Before I dive into the details, though, it's worth stating that my review unit didn't arrive with the Lumia Denim update. So, I was unable to test that firmware's biggest additions, including much-improved overall speed, a Lumia Camera app that replaces Nokia Camera and a capture mode that lets you merge the results of flash and non-flash versions of the same shot, letting you set a balanced look for the final image. I'll be sure to update my thoughts once I spend some quality time with the new features. Even without those Denim improvements, I enjoyed my time taking photos with the 830's 10MP main shooter. On a daytime stroll through downtown Tacoma, Washington, the phone capably handled any shot I attempted. White balance in good light was accurate, though it occasionally took a few seconds to settle on the right color temperature. It did tend toward cooler (bluer) temps in low-light situations, though the Nokia Camera app's manual options let me fix that quickly. Interestingly, the 830 also preferred bluish white balance when I tried to take orange-heavy photos of autumn leaves or pumpkin patches. For what it's worth, images of the same fall leaves taken with an iPhone 6 produced much more accurate colors, but that's admittedly competing in a completely different price bracket. Quirky white balance aside, the camera's optical image stabilization let me take some solid photos in low-light environments, both indoors and out. Close-up shots of sushi in a dark restaurant and portraits of fellow passengers on a bumpy car ride produced relatively clean photos, though if your jitteriness is simply out of control, the 830 won't produce miracles. Image quality starts declining when the light gets seriously low. A few interior shots of a dark, empty chapel showed a significant amount of noise, a loss of detail and muted colors, but not quite what I'd label as \"unusable.\" Of course, what's unacceptable for a huge wall print isn't the same as what's unacceptable for an Instagram post. By that I mean, if you keep your expectations in check (e.g., using a mid-range phone for social network-worthy photos), you should be fine with the results in most settings. The rear shooter's stabilization also applies to video recording (up to 1080p/30). Quality in good light is nice and sharp, though it tends to struggle in darker settings. It also takes slightly longer to adjust to different lighting levels than an iPhone 6. On the plus side, that stabilization feature does a respectable job smoothing out video, especially when you're on the move. We're not talking pocket Steadicam here, of course, but back-to-back videos of me jogging around with an iPhone 6 and the 830 resulted in steadier footage on the Lumia. Unlike the selfie-targeting 5MP front shooter on the lower-tier Lumia 735/730, the 0.9MP unit we have here is strictly average. It's fine for quick snaps and Skype, but not much else. Fortunately, the available Lumia Selfie app lets you use the rear shooter for self-portraits (an audio cue signals when your face is in the frame). For the most part, the Lumia 830 does the PureView name proud. It doesn't have the megapixel count of the 1020 or the Icon/930, so you'll have less leeway when it comes to cropping. But it's a mid-tier camera I would be happy to use on a daily basis. The auto white balance could be more reliable and the LED flash is simply average, but these are minor flies in a largely effective ointment. If the Denim update only improves things, I'll have even less to complain about at this price level. For high-resolution photo samples from the Lumia 830, click here. Performance and battery life The quad-core 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 and 1GB of RAM powering the Lumia 830 may be decidedly mid-range, but its general performance doesn't leave too much to be desired. Apps launch and close swiftly, and general navigation around the Windows Phone 8.1 UI is fluid and stutter-free. Browsing mobile web pages was a pleasant experience, though there was a good bit of tiling when zooming in and out of desktop sites. If you prefer hard numbers to gut feelings, have a look at the benchmarks below. Nokia Lumia 830 Nokia Lumia Icon Nokia Lumia 735 WPBench 252 471 245 SunSpider 1.0.2 (MS)* 1,235 538 1,237 AnTuTu 12,154 25,750 12,060 \"SunSpider: Lower scores are better. In general, we're talking about a solid performer here. Push the phone hard enough, though, and you can see the limits of its mid-level hardware. In a fast-moving, 3D game like Asphalt 8, the Lumia 830 turns in merely adequate, and definitely not silky-smooth, frame rates. And if the game's graphics don't clue you in, the frequent audio breakup during races should be a clear sign this isn't going to be a mobile-gaming powerhouse. Other games can give the 830 a workout as well. While endless runner Temple Run 2 stays smooth most of the time, certain turns, especially during water slide areas, cause things to slow down a bit. It's not just fast-moving 3D games, either. Strangely, frame rates in the relatively simple Jetpack Joyride dip noticeably whenever you hit a large patch of coins. You'd think that would make the frantic game easier, but it's really a bit jarring. On the bright side, the Lumia 830 offers solid battery life with its removable 2,200mAh cell. In our standard video-rundown test, where we loop an HD video while email, Facebook and Twitter run in the background, the 830 managed 10 hours and 39 minutes before calling it quits. That's actually a bit longer than the 10 hours Microsoft estimates for video playback. In real-world use, the phone regularly saw me through full workdays filled with emails, social networking, lunchtime Instagrams, gaming and even a few actual phone calls. Speaking of, voice calls featured clear conversations on both ends and the speakerphone performed admirably in my car. Even with the phone face-up on a table, the curved back allows enough clearance for sound to be heard without being muddled. That rear-facing speaker puts out voice and music at a decent level, though don't expect much, if any, bass to shine through Overall, if mobile gaming is important to you, it may be worth investing in a phone with a bit more oomph to tackle current and future games. If you're mainly using your smartphone for more... serious pursuits, the Lumia 830 should handle those needs without breaking much of a sweat. The competition Since AT&T hasn't yet announced a US release date or price for the Lumia 830, it's a little tricky to size up how it'll fare against the competition here. AT&T recently announced US pricing and availability info for the Lumia 830. Starting on Nov. 7th, you can snag an 830 on a two-year contract for $100, while contract-free pricing comes in at $450. The carrier's also offering a free Fitbit Flex if you're among the first to sign up. That pricing puts it in the company of last year's Apple flagship, the iPhone 5s, among others. Despite its age, the 5s will offer faster performance, especially on games -- if that's important to you. Its camera chops shouldn't be ignored either, though between the two, I'd probably prefer the 830's rear shooter thanks in part to the OIS and that hardware shutter key. Mobile OS preferences aside, it seems worth noting that while both offer 16GB of storage, the 830 backs that up with microSD support. Speaking of year-old flagships, $100 on a two-year AT&T contract could also get you an LG G2. While we were impressed with its 5.2-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 display and overall performance last year, its camera didn't draw universal praise. As for more recent entries at this price, you might also consider the second-gen Moto X. We were smitten with its near-stock Android build and customizable design, but were a bit frustrated at times with its rear camera. The 830 is also available elsewhere and in the UK, for example, EE is offering it on pay-as-you-go for \u00a3280 (about $450). Meanwhile, Amazon is offering an unlocked international version for around the same price. On EE, that puts it in roughly the same bracket as the 8GB iPhone 5c and the Ascend P7 (both listed at \u00a3300). I'd be quick to dismiss the 5c, as it offers less onboard storage (and no microSD slot) and what's essentially two-year-old hardware. The P7, on the other hand, represents a solid competitor at this price range. You won't get the Lumia's full-featured camera app, but it does boast a 1080p display and an 8MP front-facing camera. If you can do without the 830's solid, aluminum chassis and stabilized camera, take a look at its lower-priced sibling, the Lumia 735 (around \u20ac219, or about $279). It offers the same Snapdragon 400 heart in a polycarbonate body, with a much better 5MP selfie camera on the front. Although, if you're looking in that lower price bracket, don't forget the Moto G ($180), which also features similar quad-core internals, along with official support for Google's ecosystem. Wrap-up In the end, the Lumia 830 is clearly a \"bridge\" device. It's got the high-end looks and capable camera of flagship-level phones, along with the performance and display resolution of mid-range and budget models. Whether Microsoft Mobile made the right trade-offs really depends on what you want out of your smartphone. Does having a solid camera (that's due to get even better) trump average gaming performance? Does using an ever-improving voice assistant mean more to you than having official support for Google's ecosystem? Personally, I can live with most of the sacrifices that have been made. I don't think I'm missing much with the 720p screen and merely average front-facing camera. But the spotty performance in games and Microsoft's continuing struggle to land the latest and best apps give me pause. If you're in need of an anecdote, here's one: After more than a year of happily using the 41MP Lumia 1020 as my daily driver, I made the switch to the iPhone 6. Then, a week or so after that switch, I received the Lumia 830 to review and went about using it as my everyday phone. And guess what? For the most part, I didn't really miss my shiny, new iPhone. Of course, it's by no means a complete replacement -- there are still games, features and apps on iOS that I can't get elsewhere (hello, AP Stylebook Mobile). But in general, life was rather pleasant with the 830. It's an Icon(ic) phone that cuts most of the right corners. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: 830, lumia 830, lumia830, microsoft, mobilepostcross, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20985490 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20985490\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/nokia/lumia/830/\"> Nokia Lumia 830 </a> Nokia Lumia 830 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/nokia/lumia/830/\" title=\"Nokia Lumia 830 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 5 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Windows Phone (8.1) Screen size 5 inches Camera 10\u00a0megapixels Announced 2014-09-04 see all specs \u2192 8.8average user rating Reception and call quality 8 Display 9.2 Battery life 9.2 Camera 9.2 Ease of use 8.8 Design and form factor 9.6 Portability (size / weight) 8.8 Media support 8.8 Durability 8.8 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 7.6 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/12/01/samsung-gear-s-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "December 1st 2014 at 12:00 pm", "body": " Samsung's wearables strategy seems to be: \"Throw everything at a wall and see what sticks.\" In a little over 12 months, the electronics giant has launched six -- yes, six -- different smartwatches, each with its own unique personality. The latest is the Samsung Gear S, and its particular claim to fame might be the most ambitious yet: It's the first Gear watch that lets you make and receive calls from your wrist, no phone required. Yep, the Gear S actually has a 3G modem inside it, along with WiFi, Bluetooth and GPS radios. It's basically a watch that's also a phone. You can even respond to emails using a tiny onscreen keyboard. But, at $350 a pop, can it replace your phone? And more importantly, would you want it to? Gallery | 56 Photos Samsung Gear S review + See all 56 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 65 Samsung Gear S Pros Works as a standalone phone Colorful AMOLED display Decent battery life Comes with a cradle that's also a portable charger Cons Still needs a phone for activation and loading apps Limited app selection Bulky design with proprietary wrist straps Expensive Summary The Samsung Gear S is a smartwatch that's also a phone. But it still needs a phone -- and a Samsung phone, at that -- to be of any use. That, combined with its bulky design, small app selection and $350 asking price, makes the Gear S difficult to recommend. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware When I say that the Samsung Gear S is like a phone for your wrist, I don't mean just functionally -- it looks like it too. Sure, most smartwatches tend to be bulky anyway, but the Gear S takes it to another level. With a 2-inch curved AMOLED screen framed by metal sides, the Gear S looks like someone took a shrink ray to a Galaxy S5, bent it and wedged it into a plastic strap. The result is a monstrosity of glass and steel that looks, frankly, pretty ridiculous when strapped to my dainty wrist. The thick housing, chunky metal clasp and rubbery strap material do nothing to elevate the watch's style quotient either -- the design here is decidedly more geek than chic. It does fit under long sleeves comfortably though, so you can hide it if you find it embarrassing. There are also noticeably thick bezels above and below the display that make the screen seem much bigger than it actually is. Still, that's not to say the watch isn't comfortable to wear. It's certainly on the hefty side thanks to that bulky screen, but its curved shape transitions seamlessly to that plastic strap so it wraps smoothly around the wrist. Though it doesn't exactly exude the premium feel of a luxury watch, it does feel surprisingly comfortable for such a chunky device. Still, it's unfortunate the wristband is proprietary and if you want to swap out straps, you'll need to use Samsung's own offerings. Right now you can choose among blue, black, red and white options. Additionally, though I've been moaning about the size of the display, that extra screen real estate does have its merits. We've complained in previous smartwatch reviews about how tough it is to navigate menus on such a tiny screen. That's not as much of an issue with the Gear S. Tapping on selections and swiping through the different widgets and apps felt smooth and intuitive, and I liked being able to see so many menu options at a glance. Of course, that big display really comes in handy when you're dealing with visually dense apps like the Opera Mini browser, where an on-screen keyboard made even a 2-inch screen feel restrictive (more on this in a moment). The display's 480 x 360 resolution (300 ppi) is also pretty easy on the eyes -- text was easy to read and images generally looked bright and colorful. It's slightly less saturated than the S5, but that doesn't matter too much on such a small screen. The blacks look really black, and the dark background looks almost indistinguishable from the surrounding bezel. It does look pretty washed out in direct sunlight, but not so much that it's unreadable. When it's simply sitting there on your wrist, the display remains dark most of the time. The only time it lights up is when there's a notification like an incoming call. Also, thanks to the internal accelerometer, the watch face automatically comes on when you lift your wrist up to read the time -- a common feature for most smartwatches. There's also an ambient light sensor, so the screen will adjust its brightness automatically depending on the available light. If you leave it alone for a few minutes, the watch does go back to a dimmer mode before going dark again. Beneath the display is a physical home button along with the ambient light sensor and a UV detector, while the heart rate monitor and charging pins are on the watch's rear. Our particular Gear S runs on Sprint, so it doesn't have a nano-SIM card slot, but in GSM models, you'll find one located above the heart rate sensor. By default, a double-tap on the home button brings up S Voice, Samsung's voice-dictation service, while a long-press will bring up quick options like powering it off, restart, mute, WiFi and airplane mode. Bundled along with the Gear S is a portable charging cradle -- the only way you'll be able to charge it, thanks to the watch's proprietary pins. The cradle itself charges via a micro-USB cable. Having to carry this extra bit of gadgetry around annoyed me, but thankfully the dock also houses a 350mAh battery, which means it can be used as a backup charger (the watch itself only has a 300mAh battery built in). Other internal specs include an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a dual-core 1GHz processor, 512MB of RAM, 4GB of storage, Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS and, of course, that 3G modem. Software Just like the Gear, Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo, the Gear S runs on Tizen, Samsung's own Linux-based operating system. If you've used any of those watches, you'll likely feel right at home with the Gear S. The navigation language is the same -- from the watch face, you swipe right for notifications, left for widgets (you get up to five), down to access quick settings like volume and brightness and up to access the full app drawer. If you're in an app, you can back out by swiping down. Much like those other watches, the Gear S comes preinstalled with a few apps, including Samsung's S Health, a music player, one that shows the latest news headlines, another for the weather and so forth. The Gear S's main claim to fame, however, is that it also comes with a phone dialer and an app for text messaging. The dialer app is as you would expect, consisting of a number keypad and access to recent call logs. For text messaging, you can use S Voice to dictate your messages. I found it to be pretty accurate -- it even recognized commands like punctuation marks and \"all caps\" for when I felt like yelling. But if you feel a little daring, you can also use an actual on-screen keyboard, which is also used in email and other apps that require text entry. The keyboard takes up a huge chunk of the watch's screen real estate, leaving only a sliver of space at the top to see what you've typed. You can enter in text via the usual hunt-and-peck method or via dragging lines through letters \u00e0 la Swype. Surprisingly, I found this to be mostly accurate, especially with the Swype technique. Pecking is a little bit more hit-or-miss, with the autocorrect not always guessing my words correctly. In practice, however, I found typing on a watch far too tedious for anything longer than just a quick reply. You can't see all of what you've typed at a glance, and constantly having to backtrack and correct words is a pain. I'd choose S Voice over typing any day. As for loading new apps, well, you'll have to pair the watch to a compatible Samsung smartphone and download the Gear Manager app in order to do that. The Gear Manager app is largely unchanged from when we last reviewed the previous Gear watches. Once connected, you can not only use it to add and remove apps, but also customize the watch's wallpaper and watch face. You'll also have to use Gear Manager in order to transfer media files like images or audio, and sync up your fitness data to the phone's S Health app. In use Hold on, you're saying. Isn't the Gear S also a standalone phone with its own phone number? Why do I need to pair it with a phone in order to get apps onto it? Isn't the whole point of having a phone built into a watch so that you don't need to connect it to a phone? Well, if you asked these questions, then you've stumbled onto exactly the main problem I have with the Gear S. Not only do you need to pair it with a compatible Samsung phone in order to load apps onto it, but you also need to do so in order to start using the Gear S at all. That's right: When you initially start up the Gear S, the first thing it'll ask you to do is connect it to a Samsung phone with the Gear Manager app installed. The most you can do with the watch before then is make an emergency call. That, to me, defeats the purpose of the Gear S almost entirely. I might as well have spent a little less and bought a regular ol' smartwatch -- or perhaps another phone -- instead. That said, after you've taken the effort to pair the Gear S, you would have then \"unlocked\" the watch's phone properties. At last, you're able to completely divorce it from the phone if you so choose. As I mentioned above, the watch has its own phone number. When connected via Bluetooth to a phone, the Gear S will automatically make and receive calls using the phone's number instead. It's admittedly a little odd to have devices with two different phone numbers like this, but you can enable call forwarding so that all calls made to your phone's number will redirect to the watch with or without that Bluetooth connection. So, what's it like to make calls? This might sound like a clich\u00e9, but I liken it to those Dick Tracy shows of yore -- I simply held my watch up to my face and talked into it. It feels a little goofy holding my wrist to my mouth like that and I can't see myself doing it too often, but it does work. Callers had no problems hearing me, and the audio quality from the watch itself is pretty good. I didn't have to hold the watch too close to my mouth when indoors for them to hear me loud and clear -- about chest-level height was fine -- but I did have to bring it closer to my lips when I was outside on a busy city sidewalk. The speaker is certainly loud enough to hear in a quiet room, but it's also got enough volume for me to hear callers when I'm outside. If you want, you can also pair the watch with a Bluetooth headset and use that instead. I should also note here that if you do want to use the Gear S as a phone, you'll have to pay an additional monthly fee on top of your regular phone bill. Both Verizon and T-Mobile charge $5 per month while AT&T and Sprint wants $10 a month. If you're getting your Gear S through Sprint and your plan has 20GB data or more, then the carrier will waive that fee through December 2015. As for the Gear S' fitness features, well, they're sadly rather unreliable. The S Health app comes packed with five different features: a pedometer, an exercise feature that tracks your heart rate and location when you go for a run (or a walk, a bike ride, or a hike), a standalone heart rate monitor, a sleep tracker and a tool that tells you what the UV index is when you're in the great outdoors. When it works, it works well enough -- the pedometer counted my steps just fine and the heart rate monitor showed me beats-per-minute numbers that seemed on par with other fitness gadgets (I compared it with a Withings scale and the S Health app on the phone). However, there were times when the app just failed to respond. The heart rate sensor in particular sometimes doesn't work at all, stating that it's unable to find any measurement, even after I sat perfectly \"still and quiet\" as per instructions. I often had to restart the Gear S to have it all working smoothly again. There still isn't much in the way of apps from Samsung's own Gear Store either. There's no dedicated Gmail application, for example, and no Facebook or Twitter either. Of course, when you're connected to the phone, you're able to get notifications from those apps on the watch. But if you want to use the Gear S on its own, you're out of luck. I did find a few decent apps that I liked -- the calculator is a must-have and lets me pretend the Gear S is a retro calculator watch. The preinstalled Navigator app (which is essentially Nokia's Here maps rejiggered for the watch) is really handy for turn-by-turn walking directions, and though surfing the web on the tiny Opera Mini browser is a little ridiculous, the watch's screen does work well for reading short news stories while on the go. Last, but certainly not least: Let's address the question of battery life. From my two weeks using the device, the Gear S seems to last a little less than two days with light to moderate use. That means using it mostly as a watch, with notifications turned on. When I taxed it a little more by making constant phone calls and using the navigation app a couple of times, it lasted about a day and a half before needing a charge. Under really heavy use -- accessing email, browsing the web, testing the exercise app and using the navigation app to walk around town -- the Gear S lasted about a day before needing a charge. To extend it even longer between charges, you can choose to toggle a power-saving mode, which only leaves the basic time-telling and phone functions. The competition Even though the smartwatch field is relatively young, the Gear S already has plenty of competition. There are Android Wear watches like the Moto 360, the LG G Watch R and Samsung's own Gear Live. All of the Android Wear devices on the market today are cheaper than the Gear S, and some, like the Moto 360 and the G Watch R, are more stylish too. There's also something to be said for the Android Wear ecosystem and its support for a wider variety of apps than Samsung's own Galaxy. Still, the Gear S does let you leave your phone at home when going out on a jog, and its battery life compares favorably to other smartwatches. Most Android Wear watches, for example, last about a day between charges, though the recent LG G Watch R broke the mold by stretching it out to two. As for watches that are also phones, well, there aren't that many to choose from, but the Gear S does face some competition from upstarts like the Neptune Pine. Unlike the Gear S, the Pine really is like an Android smartphone shrunk down into watch form. It has a hefty 1.2GHz Snapdragon S4 processor in it; plus the internal storage starts at 16GB for only $349 (you can get it for around $300 from Amazon). That's definitely a lot more palatable than the Gear S' paltry 4GB and $350 price tag. And, of course, the Pine doesn't actually need a smartphone to get started making calls at all. All that power does come at a cost though, as the Pine only has enough battery life to last through a single day. Wrap-up The Samsung Gear S is a device that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Sure, it's great that it can act as a standalone smartwatch and doesn't need a phone to make or receive calls. Except, well, it does. Not only does the Gear S need to be paired with a phone to be activated, but that's also the only way to install or remove apps and the only way to get notifications from services like Gmail and Twitter. Certainly, the Gear S works well enough if you don't mind its chunky size, small app selection and occasionally buggy software, but $350 is just too much to pay for a smartwatch with this many shortcomings. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: gear s, gears, mobilepostcross, review, samsung, samsung gear s, samsunggears, SmartWatch, smartwatches, tizen, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20999104 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20999104\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/gear/s/\"> Samsung Gear S </a> Samsung Gear S Buy from $149 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/gear/s/\" title=\"Samsung Gear S reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 9 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Other Operating system Other Screen size 2 inches Announced 2014-08-27 see all specs \u2192 7.8average user rating Features 7.8 Display 9.3 Battery life 6.4 Ease of use 8.4 Storage capacity 8 Design and form factor 8.7 Portability (size / weight) 8.2 Durability 7.1 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $149.99 + tax & shipping Buy now $149.99 + tax & shipping Buy now 78 Smartwatch: what should it do beyond a Pebble?

That was the theme of last year's iOS update, known as iOS 7, which ushered in a flat new design. Although Apple threw in some new functionality as well, it was clear the company was mainly focused on giving its mobile OS a face-lift and setting the stage for future updates -- the first of which is coming out tomorrow. iOS 8 builds on last year's software with a plethora of new features, including third-party keyboards, camera controls, widgets, home automation, health and fitness tools and the ability to interact with other apps. (Yes, it's hard to believe these are just arriving on iOS.) Here's what to expect.

Nonetheless, the upgrade goes a long way in giving the iPhone and iPad a better user experience. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Compatibility With each new iOS release, there's an aging device or two that doesn't receive the update. All told, iOS 8 is compatible with the iPhone 4s and later, the iPad 2 and up, both iPad minis and the fifth-generation iPod touch. It'll be available as a free download starting tomorrow, September 17th. As usual, there are some devices that will iOS 8, but won't enjoy the full feature list. The new Health app, for example, will only come to the iPhones (4s and later) and fifth-gen iPod touch. Meaning, no iPad support. Additionally, the Continuity feature, which makes it possible to hand off content from mobile to desktop (and vice versa), is only available to the iPhone 5 and later, latest iPod touch, fourth-gen iPad and later and both iPad minis. User interface/layout Last year's iOS 7 release marked the operating system's first major redesign since Apple introduced the original iPhone. And it was a welcome change: After six years, the OS was starting to feel stale. Even so, the new look also came with a learning curve. The flat design of iOS 7 is prettier and more colorful, but the cartoonish appearance and confusing layout were tough to get used to -- heck, there's no shortage of Tumblrs that go into painstaking detail on the system's flaws. To be fair, much of the focus on iOS 7 was on getting developers up to speed on the design overhaul; iOS 8, on the other hand, is all about adding functionality to the iPhone and iPad. As a result, you're not going to see many significant changes to the layout or design of iOS this time around. In fact, you may not even be able to tell the difference between iOS 7 and 8 unless you're looking closely. But don't let looks deceive you: There's a lot of new stuff under the hood. Major features Continuity There's a functionality gap between Mac and mobile, and Apple has been trying to bridge it for years. With iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, the company introduced Continuity, which gives the two operating systems the ability to talk to each other -- provided they're connected to the same network and signed in with the same Apple ID. Continuity makes it possible for you to start something on one device and finish it on another. It allows you to send and receive calls on your MacBook if your iPhone is in the other room. Finally, it lets you use Airdrop to share files among multiple devices. Say you're reading a long article on the train as you head into work, but can't finish it in time. When you get into the office and turn on your Mac, you'll see an icon on the left side of the dock that wasn't there before. Click on it and that same article is now on your Safari browser on Yosemite. This is what Apple is calling \"Handoffs,\" which can be used on many of the company's native apps: Mail, Calendar, Contacts, Safari, Reminders/Notes, iWorks and even Maps. (Yes, developers can also add Handoffs into their own applications.) But what if you're on the opposite end of your commute -- heading home from a long day at the office? Before you close your laptop, look at your iDevice's lock screen and you'll notice a light icon on the bottom left. Slide up from there and, upon unlocking the device, you're taken straight into the piece you were reading on the MacBook. You can do this on multiple devices -- you could hand off Maps from your iPhone and a Safari page from your iPad -- but they compete with each other for attention. If you have Maps open on your iPhone and Safari open on your iPad, only one icon will show up on the OS X dock at a time. This means that it will also show the one with the most recent activity -- it may show your iPad's Safari icon until you touch Maps on your iPhone. What's more, this only works when the devices are powered on; if you close your MacBook, that magical icon on your iPhone's lock screen will disappear. Handoffs is just a part of the Continuity feature. As mentioned earlier, Apple's also made AirDrop a universal service so you can wirelessly transfer files between Macs and iOS devices. Your MacBook now shows up on your iOS' share menu and vice versa. A couple seconds is all it takes to push a web page, contact, photo or other info from one device to another. Voice calls are also included here. If your phone is in the other room, you can make and receive calls on your Mac or iPad instead -- as long as all devices involved are using the same Apple ID and WiFi network, and you've activated FaceTime. When you're in the call, you can mute it or transfer it back to your iPhone. The problem is, there's no way to transfer it the opposite direction; calls started on the iPhone cannot be transferred to the Mac or iPad. Lastly, what about those green bubbles from folks who don't happen to use iMessage? Continuity, my friend. Starting in October, all texts and MMS messages will begin showing up on your Mac and iPad, so you'll be able to carry on conversations regardless of which Apple device you and your friends are using. Naturally, none of this matters if you only have one Apple device -- this is really for folks who own Macs, iPads, the iPod touch or all of the above. It's a smart way for Apple to keep you locked into its ecosystem; once you get used to having all of your communications tied into every gadget you use, it's even tougher to move to Windows, Android or any other competing OS. Extensibility iOS 8 may not look much different than iOS 7 on the outside, but what takes place behind the scenes matters the most. A new set of features called Extensibility allows developers to create apps that can interact with other apps (and even iOS itself). Up until now, any interaction developers had with other programs was severely limited; if one app wanted to recruit the services of another app, you wouldn't be able to do so without hopping completely out of one and jumping into the other. By adding extensions, iOS 8 opens the platform up significantly. When it comes to interacting directly with iOS 8 itself, Extensibility makes it possible for developers to create custom keyboards that replace the stock option. You can now add widgets to the Today screen and actions to notifications, which finally make the Notification Center worth visiting. Developers can now also add their services to the iOS Share Sheets (the panel that comes up when you press the share button in apps). Before, you could only share content on Facebook, Twitter, Messages and Mail; now, the sky's the limit. Just like on Android, you should be able to save articles on Pocket without having to copy the URL, jump out of the browser, enter the Pocket app and finally add the URL. With Extensibility, sharing on any third-party app now takes one or two steps, as opposed to around five. In the same Share Sheets, Extensibility gives devs access to the bottom row of icons, known as action items; this is normally where options like print, save and copy are, but now third-party apps can add their own stuff here. Transmit, a file-management service, will offer the ability to save any file type directly to an FTP server. Bing Translate is another example; Microsoft no longer needs a special partnership to integrate this service into Safari's Share Sheet -- it can just make its very own extension to an existing app (in this case, Bing). You'd just need to hit the share button, find Bing Translate and the German website you're reading suddenly turns into English (if that's your language preference). 1Password will be updated so all you have to do to autofill a password in Safari is hit the share button, find the 1Password option and authenticate with Touch ID; previously, you had to exit the browser, find and copy the password and then hop back into Safari and paste it. Extensibility also helps when editing photos. Now you can take a picture with the stock camera, go into Photos and edit your shot using the Camera+ tools -- all without having to exit the Photos app. The sad news is that developers still don't have free rein to add extensions wherever they want. Control Center (the shortcut panel accessed by swiping up from the bottom), which seems like an obvious location to add custom third-party features, is still off-limits; widgets aren't allowed on the springboard, either. But this is a solid start, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple continue to open up more areas for customization when it feels the time is right. Keyboards When it debuted on the original iPhone, the stock iOS keyboard was among the best I'd ever used -- and it retained that status for a few years. But Apple's been pretty stubborn since then: Aside from a visual redesign (and \"shiftkeygate\"), not much has changed over the years. Fortunately, iOS 8 is not only breathing life back into the keyboard; it's also finally giving you the option to ditch it for something else. First, though, let's discuss what's improved on Apple's homegrown version. Apple has added a new predictive-typing engine called QuickType, which adapts to your various writing styles and figure out what you're going to say based on whom you're talking to and which app you're using. You might use different words around your spouse that you would never dream of saying to your boss; you likely also write differently in a long-form email than you do in a quick text. As it gets to know you, the prediction bar (which contains up to three word choices) is supposed to improve in accuracy. For the sake of privacy, however, the context it learns stays on the device and isn't uploaded to iCloud; it's only available through native apps, so QuickType won't learn from you if you're constantly using apps like WhatsApp, Gmail or Mailbox. Personally, I rarely use iMessage and Mail.app, so my experience with the predictive typing has been hit-or-miss so far. My favorite trick: When you get an email or message asking you to make a quick decision (Dinner or movie? Country or pop? Nick Fury or Justin Bieber? Bob, Bobby or Bobbarino?), QuickType figures you'll answer the question and displays only those choices, with \"not sure\" sometimes added in as the third option. It works about nine times out of 10; on the 10th time, it just reverts back to the standard predictions. QuickType should improve the stock keyboard experience, but I was much more interested in the fact that Apple is finally allowing third-party keyboards. It's something Android has had for years, and it's arguably been one of the most-requested features among iOS users. Developers like SwiftKey, Swype, TouchPal and Fleksy all have keyboards in the works, and they could hit the App Store as early as tomorrow when iOS 8 goes live. There's even a GIF keyboard called PopKey that does... well, exactly what it sounds like. I've had the opportunity to use TouchPal, as well as SwiftKey, which has already confirmed that its keyboard will go on sale tomorrow. Each one takes the form of an individual app, just like on Android; to enable them, head into the general settings menu and add them in the keyboards section. Both of the keyboards I tried use swipe gestures in addition to their own predictive-typing engines. (I anticipate others will work the same way.) If you've used either keyboard on Android, expect a similar experience on iOS. The timing here is impeccable (and perhaps not at all coincidental): Using the swipe gestures on these keyboards has greatly improved my experience on the large-screened iPhone 6 Plus. As with Samsung's Galaxy Note series and other big handsets, it's nearly impossible to type one-handed on Apple's 5.5-inch phone, but being able to swipe from one key to the next makes it much more bearable. You'll definitely want to try a few keyboards to see which one's the best fit. Manual camera controls Another huge win for developers and users alike is the inclusion of manual camera controls in third-party apps. While the majority of iOS users will be content with the stock camera (more on that in a moment), apps like Camera+, Aviary and Spark Camera will now offer more options. White balance, ISO, exposure, manual focus and even shutter speed are included as part of the package. And thanks to that Extensibility feature, these apps can also tie in directly with the Photo app, so you can take advantage of their editing tools without even having to exit. Health It's as if staying fit is the trendy thing to do these days -- at least, if you're a technology company. Quite a few phone makers are trying to add fitness-related apps and services into their latest products. Apple is no different: iOS 8 introduced HealthKit and a stand-alone Health app, which comes preloaded and can't be deleted. Think of HealthKit as the tool developers need to use to make apps and fitness products compatible with your iPhone or iPad, and think of the Health app as a central hub of sorts where all of the collected data comes together in a sensible way. The app itself seems rather boring until you start actually exercising or walking around, at which point it begins logging all of your daily stats. There's a place to add emergency information (in the form of a Medical ID); a list of sources (gadgets or apps that are collecting some of this data); a dashboard for you to keep track of your target goals; and health data, which splits information into a plethora of different categories, such as vitals, nutrition, fitness and body measurements. Here you can add your own personal health details, track your calories burned and flights climbed, monitor heart rate, set proper goals and more. The iPhone's built-in motion coprocessors make it possible to collect some of this data, including how far you've walked or run. The iPhone 6's new M8 chip also lets you track how many flights of stairs you've climbed. Still, you'll need to get accessories like fitness bands and heart rate monitors to fully take advantage of what the Health app has to offer. It shouldn't be long before we see more devices with HealthKit support, though, which might be a good time for us to revisit the Health app in iOS 8. iCloud Drive iCloud Drive is likely about as close as we're going to get to an official file manager on iOS, and even then, it's not a perfect solution. Available on both iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, iCloud Drive is a way to store any file of any kind and access it from your phone, tablet or computer. You can also grab it from any compatible app, edit and manipulate the file and save it back in the cloud. Sounds great, but there are a couple catches. First, it's more accessible on Mac than iOS; it's easily found on the left sidebar in Finder, whereas there's no way to access it on iOS unless you have an app that supports the service. The iWorks suite offers it, so you can create and edit Pages, Numbers and other documents and have it upload onto your Mac, and I wouldn't be surprised to see most cloud services and content-creation tools add support for it as well. But since there's no specific app to let you view your files on iOS, it's more difficult to take advantage of the service for now. Just like every new Apple feature, its capabilities may expand over time. And since this is a potential moneymaker for the company, this should happen sooner rather than later. In the meantime, Apple has tried to make the pricing more accessible: You can now buy 20GB for a dollar per month, 200GB for $4, 500GB for $10 and 1TB for $20. Unfortunately, you still only get 5GB for free, whereas Google and Microsoft both give away 15GB. Other than that, Google's pricing is similar, although Google offers 1TB for $10 (half the price of Apple's plan), as well as higher storage tiers. HomeKit iOS 8 also marks Apple's first major sojourn into the world of home automation, thanks to a new framework called HomeKit. Look at HomeKit as a way for iOS to communicate with the Internet of Things: appliances, thermostats, lightbulbs, garage door openers and virtually any other type of connected-home product already capable of connecting to your iOS device. Until now, there's been no central place for them to talk or interact with each other. HomeKit lets you name products, rooms, houses and functions, so Siri can recognize them and respond to requests. You'll also be able to group together certain actions into a specific profile, so if you're leaving the house, you can tell Siri something like, \"Going to work,\" and it can shut off all the lights, turn off the air conditioner and whatever else you want it to do. Apple has a lot of competition in this field. Nest, which recently was acquired by Google, just released a program called Works with Nest. This gives manufacturers the proper sets of code to link their products with Nest, Google and other accessories. On top of that, Samsung recently bought SmartThings, an open home-automation platform that connects your devices through a hardware hub and associated stand-alone app. The startup is supposedly still acting as an independent entity, and Samsung is continuing to expand its own branded platform known as Smart Home. Family Sharing This is another feature that's infinitely more useful when your entire family is among the Apple faithful. If you've shared the same Apple ID with your spouse or kids just so you don't have to purchase the same games multiple times, Family Sharing eliminates that need altogether. With iOS 8, you can have up to six Apple IDs sharing the same apps, music, photos, purchases and iBooks. You're also able to put together a family calendar (though my family's done this through Google Calendar for a long time), as well as a pooled photo album. In case you want to keep track of where everyone is, you can see the location of each member of your family. For parents whose kids like to download games with reckless abandon, parental controls have been around for ages. But in case you don't mind them buying something occasionally as long as you give permission, Family Sharing's \"Ask to Buy\" option should be a solid feature. Any time your child wants to purchase an app, iOS has to go through you first; you'll see a pop-up notification asking if you want to let little Timmy play Monument Valley. Enhanced features Notifications I'll confess: Ever since Apple launched the Notification Center in iOS 5, I haven't found much use for it. Despite the fact that it uses the same pull-down gesture from the top of the screen as Android, this feature just hasn't held my interest the way it has on Google (or even Windows Phone, for that matter). I've preferred Google's way of subtly showing you what types of notifications await you in the status bar; on iOS, I need to routinely check the menu because no visible reminder shows up. Second, it's difficult to get rid of notifications, thanks to the tiny \"X\" button you have to double-press. There's also no option to swipe away individual messages or appointments. Third, the only action I can take is to press the notification and jump into the proper app. I could go on, but these are the biggest problems. Fortunately, iOS 8 addresses some (but not all) of these issues. Notifications are now actionable; you can respond to each one without having to exit the app or game you're currently using. When a text notification drops down from the top of the screen as a banner, swipe down on it to reveal a text box. Virtually any type of notification could become actionable if the developer chooses to add support for it; I can envision the ability to like or reply to a Facebook comment, or retweet or respond to a Twitter mention. When you arrive at a restaurant, you could theoretically check in via a Foursquare notification. The banner goes away if you wait too long to act on it, at which time you have to pull down the Notification Center and swipe left on the item you want to act upon. Slightly less convenient, but still better than having to leave your current app. The problem is, if you aren't looking at your screen when the banner appears, you'll have no way of even knowing a notification is waiting for you. The infamous 'X' is still hanging around if you want to clear out all notifications from a given app, but now you can get rid of individual ones, at least; swipe left on each one to reveal a small X. Widgets Another aspect of the Notification Center that I've found somewhat pointless is the \"Today\" screen. I can see how it can be useful to some, since it shows the weather, upcoming appointments and a few other things. But I've been disappointed that developers haven't been able to do anything with this screen. Fortunately, iOS 8 lets third parties add widgets of their own here. These widgets aren't exactly the same as what you'd find hanging out on Android home screens -- they're pieces of glanceable information, and it doesn't get much more complicated than that. This feels like Apple is killing two birds with one stone: It can appease users who've been wanting widget support ever since it showed up on Android years ago, and it can do so without significant changes to the springboard. Meanwhile, it adds a splash of sorely needed customization to the Notification Center, which could make it more tempting to use. Spotlight If you have dozens of apps, hundreds of songs or a plethora of messages and emails on your device, you've likely used Spotlight search to retrieve something hiding away in a hard-to-find place. Spotlight has been great for hunting down stuff that's already on your device -- a mini-Finder of sorts -- but what if you're shopping, searching for an answer online, locating a nearby business or finding out when the next movie is playing? Spotlight has been upgraded with some new capabilities in iOS 8 that allow it to search beyond just locally stored files. You can now do Bing searches (yeah, Bing), find a Wikipedia entry, view movie times, get maps, look at trending news and even search for new apps, iBooks or iTunes songs. The same functionality can also be found in OS X Yosemite, which means Spotlight is now universal across all Apple devices. If you know exactly what you're looking for, Spotlight is now much more useful. Siri With each passing year, Siri continues to add more features. With iOS 8, Apple's digital assistant has received three crucial updates. The first is integration with Shazam. You can now ask Siri, \"What am I listening to?\" and it'll hook you up with artist and song info along with places you can buy it. It also now supports continuous talk-and-type, which means it can listen and write down what you're saying in real time, rather than having to wait until you take a breath in order to catch up. The final improvement to Siri is at once the most important and most disappointing. At last, the program is capable of actively listening and waiting for you to say its key words. Much like \"Okay, Google Now\" or \"Hey, Cortana\" on competing platforms, Siri comes to life when you say, \"Hey, Siri.\" The problem is, this is only available when the device is plugged in, which severely limits its usefulness. The new feature comes in handy when I'm on the other side of the room and I want to pull up some information or dictate a message hands-free, but I most need this feature when I'm walking or traveling and I'm nowhere near a charging station. Apple has enforced this restriction because it's concerned an always-on Siri would have a negative effect on battery life; the company also says it's partly because the feature is optimized for hands-free situations, such as when you're driving and you just need to make quick requests without being distracted. In-car use makes a lot of sense -- just make sure you've got your car charger handy. I'm hopeful that this is merely a test run and that the limitation will be lifted eventually. Native apps Nearly every major iOS release packs in a litany of improvements to Apple's native apps. I won't go over every minor detail, like whatever's been improved on the calculator, but there are plenty of items worth discussing. Let's start with the camera. I've already mentioned you'll be able to download apps that let you tinker with settings that were previously untouchable on iOS, such as ISO, white balance, shutter speed and exposure. That's great, but the basic stock app got an upgrade as well. Keeping to its minimalistic roots, the camera app can now lock focus and exposure separately by letting you touch the area you want to focus on and sliding up and down on the viewfinder to adjust the exposure. You also get a time-lapse video mode, and there's now a way to recover recently deleted photos up to 30 days old. Although I haven't been a fan of Mail.app in the past, iOS 8 includes a few updates that make me want to give it another shot. You'll have more stuff to choose from when you swipe from right to left, with three buttons instead of two. The \"More\" button isn't new, but it includes some new features, such as \"Notify me,\" which, when turned on, will ping you when someone responds to that particular email thread. You can also swipe from left to right; in fact, both swipe gestures are customizable so you can change the options around. Whenever you view an email that contains phone numbers, addresses or event times, you'll now be presented with a banner that shows this information and lets you add those details to a contact in your address book or an event in the calendar. This feature has been more useful than I expected: My inbox is full of emails from new people who I need to add to my digital Rolodex. This makes that much easier. The other fancy new feature in the Mail app is minimizing drafts. Often, I will begin writing an email, only to forget some of the points that I need to address from earlier correspondence. Previously, I would have to save the draft, exit out of the thread, hunt down the info I needed and then return to the thread. Now, I just swipe down from the title, which minimizes the draft into a small bar at the bottom of the screen. Then, I can locate what I need, and touch the bar to pull the draft back up again. It trims down my workflow by a few steps. Now on to the Messages app, which also got some clever new additions. If you're part of an annoying group-messaging thread, you can now set up a Do Not Disturb mode and mute the conversation. You can change the name of the thread to whatever topic you want, and even add more people to an existing group. It's also possible to share your location with friends by sending them a map directly in the app itself -- and you can actively disclose your current location to those friends for an hour, a day or indefinitely, if you want them to know where you are at all times. It appears these maps will only show up on other iOS devices, since multiple attempts to share my whereabouts with Android phones ultimately failed. If you're an iMessage user, you get one more perk: Slide up on the microphone icon in the bottom-right corner, and you can record an audio or video message for your friends, which gets embedded directly into the Messages app for quick access. The only time I felt tempted to use it was when I was away from home for work and wanted to hear my children's voices, but I imagine there are other scenarios in which a short-and-sweet audio clip makes sense; Apple explained that this is particularly handy for languages that have a lot of unique characters. Finally, there's Safari, Apple's own web browser. This time, it comes with support for DuckDuckGo, a search engine that doesn't track your every move or figure out what you like to search for. Additionally, any time you need to input credit card information, Safari will give you the option to scan your card, reducing the time it takes to enter the numbers yourself. Miscellaneous Just like in every major OS update, there are a lot of new features in iOS 8 -- so many, in fact, that I simply can't cover them all in this review. I've gone into detail on all of the major improvements, but part of the fun is digging through the new OS and uncovering the small stuff. First off, iOS 8 introduces WiFi calling capability. Again, this isn't a new smartphone concept, but it's one Apple's been sorely lacking. The feature makes it possible to send and receive phone calls over WiFi, which won't take away any minutes or messages from your plan and should improve the quality of your call. In the US, T-Mobile is leading the charge on this feature, and the iPhone is one of the last smartphones lacking this ability. By next year, T-Mo will be joined by AT&T, which has also promised to add WiFi calling. Apple has also opened Touch ID to developers, which means the iPhone's fingerprint scanner can now do a lot more than simply unlock your device and verify iTunes purchases. Now, apps can use Touch ID to authenticate their own services add support for Touch ID as another layer of security, much like 1Password will be able to do with its autofill feature. The new update also includes the ability to record your iOS screen when your device is connected to a Mac -- as long as it's running OS X Yosemite. This feature is much more important for developers who want an easy way to film app demos than it is for the end user, but it's still a good addition nonetheless. Another handy option is the ability to see which individual apps are draining your battery. Go into general settings and find usage. Near the bottom of the screen, you'll see a list of apps that have been using a lot of power in the past 24 hours or seven days. For all of us who've witnessed our iPhone batteries draining faster than usual, this feature may help us single out the offending apps. Speaking of which, there may be a time or two when your phone gets lost and the battery dies before you can find it. iOS 8 makes it possible for the device to send its last location to Apple just before it powers off, so you should be able to get in touch with customer support and figure out where your iPhone or iPad disappeared. Wrap-up Last year's iOS 7 update was the largest redesign in the platform's seven-year history, but it didn't add much in the way of functionality. Which is a shame, because although the ecosystem has been robust, it was still missing a lot of stuff that Android users already enjoy. Now that developers have had time to tweak their app designs to fit Apple's vision, iOS 8 is here with features that iPhone and iPad users have long been begging for. Custom keyboards, manual camera controls, extensions that let apps interact with each other, widgets (albeit limited) and actionable notifications are features that Android users have enjoyed for a long time -- and they work well on iOS, too. That said, the new software isn't perfect. iCloud Drive, Apple's alternative to a proper iOS file manager, is in the early stages. For now, at least, it's easier to access on OS X than iOS, which doesn't currently have its own app. Very little was done to improve the struggling Apple Maps, and while \"Hey Siri\" is a welcome addition to the digital assistant, I only found it useful in the car, and even then, only as long as I have it plugged in. Finally, while I find myself using Notification Center more than ever, I'm frustrated that I have no way of knowing if anything's in there until I actually take a peek. Nitpicks aside, the strengths of iOS 8 clearly outnumber the flaws. During my time with the new OS, I couldn't help but wonder where many of these new features have been the last few years. Apple's working hard to stay competitive, matching its rivals feature for feature. iOS 8 isn't a ground-breaking update, then, but for Apple loyalists, this improved user experience is nonetheless great news.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2015/03/23/dell-venue-8-7000-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "March 23rd 2015 at 11:00 am", "body": " Engadget doesn't review many tablets anymore. When it comes to Android devices, we're far more likely to write about phablets, those supersized smartphones that for many people have eliminated the need for a dedicated slate. Meanwhile, iPad sales have slowed, and Apple has made so few changes to its products that in some cases we actually recommend you buy the previous-gen model to save money. Still, there are some companies that continue to not just build tablets, but also produce interesting designs. One of them is none other than Dell, a company whose track record includes some sensible Windows slates, a series of forgettable Android tablets and a phablet that was ahead of its time. Lately, though, the company has been undergoing a reawakening, with a series of striking products that includes the XPS 13 and the Venue 8 7000, a $399 Android tablet. The Venue 8, as I'll call it from here on out, is notable mostly for its design, marked by a stunning OLED display and a skinny 6mm-thick frame. It also happens to be the first tablet with Intel's RealSense 3D camera setup. All told, that combination of specs was impressive enough to win it a Best of CES Award. But does that mean you should go out and buy one? Gallery | 28 Photos Dell Venue 8 7000 review + See all 28 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 84 Dell Venue 8 7000 Pros Well-built, very slim design Long battery life Stunning screen The first tablet with Intel's RealSense 3D camera setup Cons It's too easy to accidentally obstruct the speaker and rear camera Despite Intel's RealSense technology, the actual image quality is mediocre Summary Dell's flagship Venue 8 tablet is thin and well-made with a stunning screen and long battery life. It's one of the best Android slates you can buy, but we'd like it even more if the image quality from the camera were better -- and if it weren't so easy to cover up the speaker and rear lens with your fingers. \u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware \"That's a Dell?\" I can't tell you how many times I've heard that since I started using the Venue 8 in public, and showing it off to colleagues. If you're reading this, Dell, that's actually a compliment. A backhanded compliment, to be sure, but high praise nonetheless. With its machined aluminum surfaces, blunt edges and front-facing speaker setup, the Venue 8 looks like something HTC would have made back in its original HTC One phase. It does not look like the brainchild of a company that went private so that it could focus on making more corporate-friendly PCs. It's actually difficult for me to say what I like best about the design. Under duress, though, I think I'd pick the screen. What we have here is an incredibly crisp 8.4-inch, 2,560 x 1,600 panel, slightly larger than the iPad mini's, with a slightly higher pixel density to match (361 pixels per inch versus 326 on the mini 3). But the sharpness is only part of the story. The OLED display also brings deep blacks, white whites, bright colors and strong viewing angles. Every time I pick up an OLED tablet, whether it be the Samsung Galaxy Tab S or the older Galaxy Tab 7.7, I find myself floored by the beauty. As a bonus, the battery life on those devices also tends to be pretty epic. What can I say, then? It hasn't gotten old for me -- especially since relatively few tablets even have screens like this. I'm not sure why they're still so rare -- it's clearly possible to build a reasonably priced OLED tablet -- but in any case, I'm glad Dell went with the best possible option. It makes a difference. Last thing about the display before I move on: It's nearly bezel-less. Other than a thin metal band about as thick as a fingernail, it's all screen, from edge to edge. Even the black space surrounding the screen is minimal. It's a gorgeous sight, all those lit-up pixels, but it does at times feel a little impractical. If I'm holding the display in portrait mode, as it was primarily meant to be used, my thumbs cover both the metal bezel and even the black buffer space, leaving me no choice but to block the picture with my fingers. I could hold on at the bottom too, but that makes for some uncomfortable weight distribution and besides, my fingers will end up covering the front-facing speaker located below the display. So long as I'm talking about what it feels like to hold the device, this might be a good time to mention the Venue 8's aluminum shell. At 6mm thick, this is the world's thinnest tablet, or so Dell says, and it's also lighter than you'd expect an all-metal device to be, at 0.67 pound. (For comparison's sake, the iPad mini 3 weighs 0.73 pound.) The Venue 8 feels well-crafted, like someone spent a lot of time thinking about how durable the tablet should be, or how nice it is to press your fingers against cold, hard metal. In a word, it feels expensive. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem someone spent as much time thinking about the camera placement. The three cameras in Intel's RealSense setup are housed on the rear of the tablet toward the bottom, with two of them inside a thin strip, and one inside a wider panel along the lower edge. If you're holding the tablet in portrait, your fingers will almost certainly be blocking one of the lenses, which means you'll almost certainly need to flip the tablet upside-down to take a shot. Fortunately, all of the other ports are exactly where you'd expect them to be. Along the left-hand side are your usual power button and volume rocker. The good news is that because they're up toward the top, you're unlikely to press them accidentally. The bad news: They won't be in thumb's reach if you're using the thing in portrait mode. Ah well. Moving on, there's a pin-locked microSD slot on the lower-right edge, which accepts cards as large as 512GB, and which also has room for a SIM card on the forthcoming LTE model. (My review unit was WiFi-only.) Up front is a 2-megapixel webcam for video chats and the occasional selfie. Last but not least, there's a standard micro-USB socket on the bottom edge for charging and data transfer. Pretty standard stuff. Camera So far, I've referred to RealSense as a \"3D\" camera setup. The better term might actually be \"depth-sensing.\" In addition to an 8-megapixel rear camera -- clearly, the main shooter -- you get two stereoscopic 720p cameras on either side, which allow the device to collect multiple layers of depth information. So, when you take a shot in the camera's special depth-sensing mode (this part is important), what you're actually getting is an amalgam of several shots: one with the foreground in focus, one with the background, et cetera. This allows you to do some interesting things. Using Dell's included \"Gallery\" app, you can adjust the focus of the shot, blurring out the background to focus on the foreground, or vice versa. And, because the shot is broken down into several pieces, you can apply effects selectively, too (think: sepia in the foreground only). Think of it as owning a Lytro, except instead of a single-purpose, one-trick camera, you also get a full-featured Android tablet. Gallery | 20 Photos Dell Venue 8 7000 sample shots + See all 20 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Before you get started, you should know this: Although depth capture is one of the tablet's marquee features, it's not actually the default shooting mode in the Dell Camera app. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this at first, so I opened up the gallery later to find that many of my would-be depth-capture shots actually weren't. That said, it is a useful feature to have. I suspect for the best results you'd probably want a scene with both an interesting background and foreground, though I even appreciated being able to blur out passersby who would have otherwise ruined my shot. I didn't always feel like I needed the depth-sensing mode, but I preferred to have it enabled in the background, just in case. The only drawback to that is that the processing times are significantly slower with depth capture. That doesn't bode well for instant gratification, but at least that processing happens in the background, so that you can continue taking more shots while you wait. Gallery | 6 Photos Dell Camera and Dell Gallery screenshots + See all 6 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") There's also a measurement feature allowing you to estimate an object's dimensions without having to whip out real-life measuring tape. For this to work properly, Dell says you should stand between three and 16 feet away from your subject. More than any of the other features here, this one feels like a gimmick. Not only does it take practice, but also how often are you likely to use this feature anyway? And I mean, if you were about to order a couch for your living room, wouldn't you probably bust out a real tape measure to get a precise measurement, even just to double-check the tablet? I know I would. The problem is that as neat as all these features are, the actual image quality is utterly unremarkable. Colors are pleasing enough, but on the dull side. My macro shots were often lacking in fine detail. If you have the patience, you might be able to improve the quality somewhat by adjusting the settings, which include options for ISO, white balance and exposure. There's also a handful of scene modes in addition to \"Auto,\" including things like nighttime and action photography. Again, it's not a bad camera, per se; you'd just think the image quality on the first RealSense tablet would be a bit more eye-popping. Performance, battery life and software Dell Venue 8 7000 series Samsung Galaxy Tab S** Google Nexus 9 iPad Air 2 Quadrant 2.0 26,994 18,597 13,737 N/A Vellamo (HTML test) 3,001 1,672 2,653 N/A SunSpider 1.0.2* (ms) 610.3 1,109 948.3 303 3DMark IS Unlimited 20,452 12,431 24,256 21,659 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 12 5.5 31 32.4 CF-Bench 62,799 31,695 18,495 N/A AndEBench-Pro 7,009 N/A 10,060 N/A *SunSpider: Lower scores are better. **Average scores for the 8.4- and 10.5-inch models. Speeds and feeds aren't everything, but it's difficult to talk about performance without first talking about specs. Here's what we're working with: a quad-core Intel Atom Z3580 processor, paired with 2GB of RAM and Intel HD Graphics (a PowerVR G6430 GPU). Judging by both my own experiences, as well as a battery of benchmark tests, I'd say the Venue 8 can generally match other high-performance tablets. Not only did I enjoy smooth streaming apps like Netflix, but also the Venue 8 did a good job putting up with all my attention-deficit-fueled habits (read: opening more apps at once than I can really focus on, and then constantly toggling back and forth). In all the weeks I've had the tablet in my possession, I can't remember any app crashes, freezes or even slowdowns. It runs like the flagship Android device it is. All that's backed up by the benchmark scores. The tablet performed well on various web-rendering tests, like SunSpider and Vellamo. It also matches its peers in the popular graphics benchmark 3DMark, and even bests them in certain performance tests like CF-Bench (I don't put as much stock in Quadrant, but I still run it anyway, out of curiosity). If anything, I wish there were more tablet-optimized apps that better took advantage of the larger screen; that, more than anything, would have improved the experience for me. Still, that's not something I can hold against Intel or Dell.

As it turns out, that's quite the conservative estimate: In my tests, I logged 12 hours and 11 minutes of video playback, far longer than I initially expected. That's not the longest battery life we've seen -- the iPad mini 3 and Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact both get close to 14 hours -- but by no means does 12-plus hours constitute \"short\" runtime either. In fact, we got nearly the same battery life on both the 8- and 10-inch versions of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S, which are also super-thin with OLED screens. Frankly, I'm very pleased with the runtime here, and I think you will be too. If anything, I wish device makers would make this much progress on the smartphone front, too. I'll admit I haven't always been dazzled by Dell's Android tablets, but the company has tended to get the software right. Dell's strategy is simple: Leave Android alone. What we have here is a clean build of Android KitKat 4.4, with absolutely no skinning or alterations to the OS. You will find a handful of pre-installed apps, including Dropbox (complete with 20GB of free storage for a year), Evernote, Flipboard, Flixster, Ice Age Adventures, MaxxAudio, McAfee Security, Polaris Office, Skitch, The Weather Channel, Vine and UnoFriends. It's not that I like booting up a device for the first time to find apps I didn't ask for, but they're easy enough to uninstall. If anything, I wish the Venue 8 ran the latest version of Android, but even then, a Dell spokesperson says an update to version 5.0 (\"Lollipop\") is coming in a month or so. Configuration options and the competition As of this writing, Dell is selling just one configuration of the Venue 8: the 16GB model I tested, which costs $399. Really, the only customization options are the optional accessories. This includes the regular folio cover, a $50 case that allows you to prop up the tablet (thereby rendering that \"fingers covering the screen and speakers\" thing moot). There's also a pricier $90 folio that adds a built-in Bluetooth keyboard. Finally, there's Dell Cast, an $80 HDMI dongle that allows you to either mirror your tablet's screen on a larger device (much like Chromecast) or turn your bigger screen into your tablet's desktop. In short, it works much the same way Miracast does on other devices. When it comes to smaller-screened tablets with high-end specs, Dell has a good deal of competition. Its most obvious rival is the iPad, though not necessarily the iPad you think. Apple's current small-screen tablet is the iPad mini 3, which costs $399 with 16GB of built-in storage, just like the Venue 8. To summarize what I've written so far, they're both slim, handsome devices, though the Venue 8 is slightly thinner and has a slightly crisper screen. Both are fast with long battery life, though the iPad's is slightly longer. The decision, then, comes down mostly to app selection and camera quality. Here's the catch, though: Apple is also selling last year's Retina display iPad mini for $299 and up, and it's virtually the same tablet as the mini 3! The only real difference is the lack of a fingerprint sensor. If you can deal with that, the iPad mini 2 is easily the smarter purchase, if only because it's a hundred bucks cheaper. But what if you're simply not an iPad person? Luckily for you, you've got a glut of Android options too. NVIDIA's gaming-focused Shield Tablet has a few minor flaws, but it's a smart buy for just $299. Then there's the 8.4-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab S, which also has a similar 6.6mm-thick frame, 2,560 x 1,600 OLED screen and 12-hour battery. Personally, I find Samsung's \"Magazine UX\" tablet skin to be overbearing, and would probably choose something closer to stock Android if I were spending my own money. Still, if you're a fan of Samsung's smartphones, you might actually prefer the user experience here. Just keep in mind that the Galaxy Tab S is nearly a year old; if you demand the latest and greatest, you may as well wait for a refresh. Need more ideas? You might consider the Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, which brings a slim, well-built, waterproof design, along with a vibrant screen and long battery life. Still, at $500, there's no reason to buy this over other models, many of which have sharper screens and more capable cameras. Meanwhile, if you'd be willing to settle for a mere full HD screen, you could have either the Lenovo Tab S8 (currently selling for $180) or the Acer A1-840FHD, which runs at $200. Either way, you've got lots of solid options. Wrap-up At $399, the Dell Venue 8 7000 isn't exactly cheap, but it mostly merits its flagship price. Thanks to a combination of a thin and beautiful design, excellent build quality, long battery life and a stunning screen, the Venue 8 earns its status as one of the best Android tablets you can buy. As the first tab with Intel's RealSense 3D camera setup, its unique photographic capabilities are a draw too, although some of the use cases feel more like gimmicks. What would make this already-excellent tablet even better is better image quality to match its imaging tricks. Also, while having the world's thinnest tablet design is mostly a plus, some ill-thought-out design decisions mean your fingers will end up blocking the speaker and rear cameras more often than you might like. These annoyances aside, the Venue 8 is an impressive device that shows Dell doesn't deserve to still be the butt of \"Dude, you're getting a Dell\" jokes; the once-stodgy PC maker has shown it can go head to head with the likes of Samsung, Sony and Apple. Even if the Venue 8 itself isn't perfect, it makes me excited to see what the company does next. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: dell, dellvenue8, DellVenue87000, dellvenue87000series, intel, realsense, review, uk-reviews, venue8, venue87000, Venue87000Series, video \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21143645 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21143645\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/dell/venue/8-2nd-gen/\"> Dell Venue 8 2nd-gen </a> Dell Venue 8 2nd-gen Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/dell/venue/8-2nd-gen/\" title=\"Dell Venue 8 2nd-gen reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Tablet Operating system Android (KitKat [4.4]) Screen size 8 inches Storage type Internal storage (16 GB, Flash), Memory card Camera (integrated) 5\u00a0megapixels Weight 0.74 oz Released 2014-07-01 see all specs \u2192 1average user rating Features 6 Display 8 Battery life 10 Ease of use 2 Storage capacity 6 Design and form factor 8 Portability (size / weight) 10 Durability 8 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

Samsung thinks so. Its second experimentally screened phone taps into its hardware R&D and production clout to offer something not many other companies can make, let alone bring to the public outside of a fuzzy proof of concept. And so, following the Galaxy Round, here's the Galaxy Edge. If you take the basic shape and concept, it's the spitting image of the curved-screen Youm prototype spied at CES a little less than two years ago. Now, though, it's a for-real smartphone you can buy. I've been testing it out in Japan, where it launched instead of the Note 4, although both the Note 4 and the Note Edge will eventually be available in the US. Fortunately, despite the unusual, (addictively stroke-able) curved screen, it still packs all of the good things that made the Note 4 such a strong choice. But bragging rights aside, is there enough of an argument for a curved screen? Should you just get the Note 4 anyway? Gallery | 23 Photos Samsung Galaxy Note Edge review + See all 23 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 85 Samsung Galaxy Note Edge Pros Beautiful, high-resolution curved display Long battery life\u00a0 \u00a0 Good camera Pretty much a Galaxy Note 4 Cons Expensive compared to the Galaxy Note 4 Not enough uses for the curved edge Not ideal for left-handed users Pretty much a Galaxy Note 4 Summary The Galaxy Note Edge is an experiment, yet it's one that's able to stand on its strengths, despite any reservations you might have about that curved display. In short, you get all the benefits of the Galaxy Note 4, but with a hardware twist to set it apart. Unfortunately, there's that price. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware The Galaxy Note Edge grabs your attention. Its curves are subjective and divisive; my friends and colleagues have offered up reactions ranging from outright bemusement to adoration. The screen looks great, with the punchy contrast and sharpness that's been a Samsung flagship mainstay for years. We'll get back to that edge, but it's the headline part of a 5.6-inch Quad-HD+ display. (\"Plus\" here, in comparison to the Note 4, means an additional 160 rows of pixels.) This means a little chunk of extra screen makes the phone just less than 4mm wider, and around 2mm shorter, than the Note 4. The screen is marginally smaller than the Note 4, despite the cranked-up pixel count. Like the Note 4, text pops a little more, and pictures you take with the 16MP camera are obviously better replicated on the Note Edge's screen. Color purists: Yep, the shades are still a little overdone, but you can choose from a few custom color palettes if you're not a fan of high-contrast menus and photos. Regardless, you get the feeling that this is the bleeding edge of Samsung's phone-making skills, right here in your hand, and that's because of the curve. Samsung's explained, officially, that it put the curve to the right to replicate how we read books. Lefties aren't going to be too happy, but the one-sided design is what gives the phone a kick. (For the 10 percent of our readers that are left-handed, you can flip the phone around and the screen will follow, but the physical home button, ports and volume controls (let alone the mic for voice calls), will all be in nonsensical places. We drafted in lefties to compare it with the Note 4 and the latter was deemed much more comfortable. (What's the use in a curved screen if it's in the wrong place?) The company was able to curve the display using the same technology it featured on the Galaxy Round, but there's more emphasis here on giving purpose to the uniqueness of the Edge. Samsung's crafted what's best described as a special kind of edge \"widget,\" but I'll explain what sort of value it adds in the software section. There's some purpose to it -- but perhaps not quite enough. One of the best things about the Galaxy Note Edge is how much it resembles the Note 4. In fact, barring that giveaway right edge, from nearly all angles it looks like the Note 4, and that's a good thing. It has nearly all the same design touches and material finishes as the Note 4. As my colleague Brad mentioned in his review, the leather-like backing on Samsung's phones this year is much improved: It looks and feels much classier, and the fake stitches are gone too. There are also machined-aluminum buttons to match the sides, an IR remote and headphone socket up top, and a USB charger, a downgrade from the Note 3, at the base. This means slower transfers, but I can cope for the aesthetics. In time-honored Samsung style, there's also a physical home button with capacitive multitasking and back buttons balancing out the lower bezel. Lastly, there's a built-in heart rate monitor nestled alongside the flash, while a single speaker grille sits in the lower-left corner, ready to be obscured by your hand when you hold it. Whoops. There's been no corners cut with regards to specifications -- fantastically, it goes toe to toe with the Note 4. It's the same high-resolution (2,560 \u00d7 1,600) screen -- we're certain a mere 1080p \"Plus\" curved display would have been cheaper to make -- as well as a 2.7GHz processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage (and a 64GB option), with a microSD slot for expansion. On paper, the only place that's been limited is the battery: a smaller 3,000mAh pack powers this special edition Note, compared to 3,220mAh in Note number four. The stylus is another product of Samsung's collaboration with Montblanc: Multiple sensitivity levels and a nice grippy surface are the highlights. I'd point you to our Note 4 review for a closer look, but suffice to say that the stylus has turned into a real selling point for the Note series, with one caveat: There's a steep learning curve to using it. After using the Galaxy Note 2 for some time, the extra features and changes meant I came often unstuck at the start. My personal favorite, which I used a surprising number of times, was Image Clip, which allows you to copy and paste parts of your screen -- maps, parts of an image -- and save it for reference or use later. Combining my scraps with a messaging app was simplicity. The new pen even lets you batch select parts of text or even files and pictures -- yes, a real productivity tool! One-handed use Disclaimer: Your hand is different from mine, but it seems only fair to do the same comparison we did for the Note 4. The Note Edge is wider than the Note 4, and although I've only spent a brief time with the latter, the curved, tapered side of the Note Edge seemed to fit rather snugly into the corner of my palm. I never found it uncomfortable, but please don't forget it remains a big phone. Both come with software tricks like shrinkable keyboards as well as a new, tiny floating menu that can be stuck to the outer edge of the screen. This duplicates the capacitive button row, which could be a solution of sorts for lefties. I can even make this secondary menu transparent, allowing me to maintain all that screen space. The ability to shrink the likes of Chrome and Google Maps to a popup window and layer it on top of other apps is also useful; I'd love to see something similar on the iPhone 6 Plus. And how does Apple's biggest phone compare to the Note Edge? Well, both remain unwieldy to grip, and the Note Edge is wider. However, the edged screen nuzzles into my hand better and those software tweaks mentioned above give it the advantage. However, just like the stylus, there's a while before you get the knack of all the little provisions Samsung's made to ease users into this screen size. Software If you're looking to learn more about the stylus' uses, I'd advise a quick read of Brad's Galaxy Note 4 review, because the setup is identical here. Yes, there are TouchWiz bits running on Android 4.4 KitKat, but Samsung continues to clear away unnecessary bloat and options. It's still a work in progress, though, and I feel the settings menus are particularly obtuse compared to other Android phones -- and especially iOS. It takes some getting used to. But let's focus on what's different here: that edge. There are two display modes you can flit between: a slender, unassuming bar that can display a customized message and a more substantial column that attempts to offer extra functionality, notifications or context-dependent menus for certain apps, like the camera. When it's expanded, the UI is a basic row of icons, which you can navigate with a little swipe. This may look a little unusual, but swishing through the various mini-screens (you can configure what it shows, and even install third-party \"edges\"), is immensely satisfying. While you can cycle through up to seven edges (why the limit?), each can also be toggled off, so you could strip it down to simply a notification and app shortcut bar. Or you could keep seven different things there: weather, stocks, bizarre memory-matching game, your pedometer stats or a Japan-only navigation bar that'll offer traffic alerts and your nearest train station. Predictably, there's a way to go on these edge apps -- did Samsung not learn from those early wearables? The edge could be so much more useful with Spotify controls or a Gmail notification bar that offers more than just a number of unread emails. The edge of the screen also comes into its own when Samsung went to the effort to add dedicated menus. For the camera, this means your viewfinder isn't obscured, which is nice. Similarly, when playing video, you get the fullscreen playback, and tapping the screen brings up controls along the curved edge. Notifications will also appear here, which is a nice touch. However, app-dependent edge functions stop there, and the camera and video player both seem like the most useful scenarios for it. I ended up using the edge screen differently. I felt like my apps belong better on the side, and customized the favorites edge to include all my regular apps like Chrome and Maps. Rather than squeeze as many of these vital apps onto a home screen (or two), I can house them on that swipeable side. The screen can then showcase wallpaper, or suitably pretty widgets. Apps are then not a button press, but a swish away. Samsung (and Apple) might not like it, but it reminds me very much of my Mac setup. You can also turn the edge into a centimetered ruler. Not sure how much you're going to use that function -- I didn't use it once. Something I did like was the night clock setting, which, when it hits a certain prescribed time, will light up the edge with a simple clock readout. These might be the best parts, but the marvel remains the technical accomplishment of the curved screen. The applications for it don't quite amount to enough -- at least right now. What does the edge lack? What do I want? I'm not even sure, but when text scrolls down the edge and you're facing the right side, the edge, of the phone, it's upside-down. If Samsung were to reverse it, then it'd be upside-down when you're using the thing. It's particularly frustrating for the Twitter widget, which scrolls through highlights. Camera Again, Samsung didn't cut any corners when it came to the phone's imaging prowess. The Note Edge packs a 16-megapixel camera, with Samsung's \"smart OIS\" intended to eke the light (and detail) in tougher lighting. The front-facing camera is also a top-end sensor compared to the competition, 3.7 megapixels with an f/1.9 lens. There's also a (bizarre-sounding) selfie mode that stitches a trio of pictures together for widescreen, \"best friends!\" capture -- when you have more than two BFFs. Gallery | 17 Photos Samsung Galaxy Note Edge sample shots + See all 17 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") While I'm not a huge selfie taker, you'll have to ask our Senior Selfie Editor, but I do take a whole lot of photos with my smartphone, so I was interested to see how Samsung's newest smartphone camera handled (yup, it's in the Note 4, too). Fortunately, I spent time with the Note Edge in Tokyo and New York: two places where sample photos can be done pretty much everywhere. All told, it's an excellent camera. The image stabilizing works well on all the neon lights that pepper Tokyo, while even people were neatly captured. There's some noise, but it compares favorably against older Galaxy phones. Daylight meant effortless captures and some really nice shots, if I say so myself. Focus was swift, and auto white balance seemed to gauge scenes perfectly. If you have a proclivity for HDR, rest assured the Edge does an excellent job there.\nPerformance and battery life Samsung Galaxy Note Edge Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Samsung Galaxy S5 iPhone 6 Plus Quadrant 2.0 23,861 24,425 24,714 N/A Vellamo 3.0 1,882 1,808 1,656 N/A 3DMark IS Unlimited 19,912 20,692 17,954 17,902 SunSpider 1.0 (ms) 788 793 820 388 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 18.4 18.8 11.5 18.2 CF-Bench 40,143 43,234 33,351 N/A SunSpider: Lower scores are better. It bears repeating: Samsung's treated the Galaxy Edge buyer to some of the best components underneath that curved display: 3GB of RAM to ensure multitask windowing runs smoothly, and a quad-core Snapdragon 805 processor to back it up. Like the Note 4, lag and slowdown simply didn't happen. However, there were the occasional hiccups where the edge widget would refuse to cycle to the next page. The only fix I found was to reset the phone. It's a shame, as it's a minor issue that stops the phone getting full performance marks. The Edge goes toe to toe with the Note 4, because well, it's pretty much the same phone. But how about the smaller battery, one of the only hardware differences? With a little more screen resolution and less capacity on the cell, we feared the worse. Well, in our battery of... battery tests, it lies somewhere between the Note and Galaxy S series. It's not quite as good as the former, but better than the latter: A very heavy day of use (lots of maps, lots of photos) will tucker out the phone before bedtime. That said, in our video-loop battery test at half brightness, the Note Edge's 3,000mAh cell ran out after just over 10 hours. With more moderate use, the phone would arrive back at my house with around 20 percent left, enough to notify me that I needed to charge. The fingerprint sensor to unlock the phone is more sensitive and accurate than preceding Galaxy devices, although the heart rate sensor on the back of my Note Edge didn't seem to pick up my pulse at all. I wasn't dead, and a second Note Edge we picked up for testing did offer up readings swiftly inside the phone's S Health app. The competition When it comes to big smartphones, we've never had quite as many strong options. What was once the domain of only Samsung and LG now has competition from Apple and even smaller upstarts like OnePlus. Samsung has launched the Note Edge mere months after its own Note 4, and the phones are identical in so many ways. The major difference isn't that the battery's smaller on the Edge, but the price: off-contract the Note 4 comes in at around $800. The Note Edge, meanwhile is priced at $950 -- just shy of 200 bucks more. On-contract pricing on AT&T comes to around $400, while the Note 4 and the iPhone 6 Plus ring in at $300. Apple's iPhone 6 Plus, lacking a stylus, but coming with the slicker iOS 8, starts at $750 off-contract for a 16GB model. Unlike both of this year's Galaxy Notes, however, you can't upgrade the storage -- something worth bearing in mind. Then there's the OnePlus One: a lower-resolution (but still gorgeous) 5.5-inch 1080p display, no stylus, no add-on storage, but you could buy three and have spare change for cases compared to the Galaxy Note Edge. It boils down to how much you want a stylus, and how much you're willing to pay for a phone that's not like anything else. Wrap-up Is the Note Edge a gimmick? It's hard to say, but I don't think the curved display is a bad thing. The best part is that even without the edge, you've still got, for all intents and purposes, a Galaxy Note 4, with a stylus, power, long battery life and a capable camera. The more I used the Note Edge, the less the edge part seemed to matter: I'd use the shortcuts to apps from the edge, but gradually disabled most of the widgets. Pervasive uses for the curve aren't quite there. What did remain was how gosh-darn eye-catching the display was, augmented by that curved AMOLED glow. And if foldable smartphones and tablets are going to happen, if devices with more useful, innovative displays are to appear, phones like the Note Edge are the iterations that need to happen. If you liked any of the previous Galaxy Notes, or were at least intrigued by them, then the Galaxy Note Edge deserves the same amount of attention -- even if, at $980 off-contract, you're really paying for that progress.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/28/hp-stream-11-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "November 28th 2014 at 10:00 am", "body": " It's no secret that people like Chromebooks. That can't be good news for Microsoft, which used to own the market for cheap computers. Not one to take this sort of encroachment lying down, Microsoft came out with a lower-cost version of Windows 8.1 that PC makers could use to build small, lightweight devices inexpensive enough to take on Chromebooks. The HP Stream 11 is among the first of these so-called Chromebook killers: an 11.6-inch laptop running full Windows and priced at just $200. For the money, it looks and performs like a netbook, with a colorful plastic shell and an Intel Celeron processor chugging away under the hood. Then again, though, you also have the option of installing traditional desktop apps, which you can't do on a Chromebook, and Microsoft is further sweetening the deal by throwing in a terabyte of OneDrive storage and a yearlong subscription to Office 365. So is this just netbooks, redux? Or does an aggressive price make all the difference?

But damn if it isn't one of the more stylish netbooks I've seen. Available in either magenta or the cobalt blue you see in the above photos, the Stream has a neat fade-out effect, with the colors on the keyboard deck getting lighter and lighter as you get toward the touchpad. The keyboard deck also has a subtle dot pattern throughout, creating the illusion of texture on an otherwise smooth machine (it also looks cool, if you ask me). I also like the way the white keyboard contrasts with the colorful interior. Anyway! You're probably sick of hearing me opine about design, but I assume you get the idea: Love or hate the aesthetic here, I think we can all agree this has a more interesting look than most of the other gray boxes you're gonna find at this price. Around the edges, you'll notice that HP matches Chromebooks spec for spec, offering all the same ports you'd find on a Chrome OS device. This includes two USB connections (one 3.0, one 2.0), a full-sized HDMI socket, a full-sized SD card reader and a combination headphone/mic jack. There's also a Kensington lock slot -- a particularly crucial feature for schools that choose to use this in classrooms. Just like a typical 11-inch Chromebook, the Stream 11 features a 1,366 x 768 non-touch display, complete with a healthy amount of bezel. I've no complaints about the resolution: There's no other machine I know of at this price that also has a full HD display. I do, however, have some quibbles about the actual quality. First off, despite having a matte, anti-glare finish, the viewing angles are fairly narrow, especially from head-on, when you try and dip the lid forward. I've also noticed that the colors tend to wash out when I crank up the brightness, but if I settle on a more medium setting, everything looks dull and muted. Again, not a shocker at this price, but it is a reminder of the sort of trade-offs you'll be making. One thing that might surprise you is the audio quality. Even with the speakers located on the bottom side of the notebook, I still enjoyed loud volume with the machine resting in my lap and on flat surfaces. And, thanks to the DTS Studio Sound technology on board, the actual quality was disarmingly good, too. For almost every genre I tried -- jazz, orchestral, swing, pop, electronica -- tracks came through loud and clear, with minimal tinniness or distortion. Finally, I was also pleased with the keyboard -- as I often am on HP laptops, I might add. Despite the fact that this is a petite, 11.6-inch machine, the keyboard is nearly full-sized, with generous spacing between the buttons and very few undersized keys (the Ctrl and Fn buttons on the far left side are the two major exceptions). Also, because the Stream 11 doesn't claim to be a particularly skinny laptop, HP was able to build in a little extra keyboard travel, making for some springy, tactile button. As for the touchpad, I had an easy time pulling off multitouch gestures, like using two fingers to scroll side to side through the Start Screen, but single-finger tracking was sometimes an issue in desktop mode.

The Stream 11 might be cheap enough to compete with a Chromebook, but that doesn't necessarily mean it performs like one. Though it uses an Intel Celeron N2840 processor similar to what you'll find in many Chrome OS devices, it feels... slower. A cold-boot, for instance, takes 26 seconds, and that's just to get to the lock screen; even after you enter your password, you're looking at another eight seconds or so until the desktop is fully loaded. Most Chromebooks, meanwhile, take well under seven seconds to boot up -- maybe 12 on really sluggish models. Either way, a half-minute boot sequence is unheard of on Chrome devices. Web performance is a mixed bag too: the Stream 11 beats every other Chromebook in the SunSpider benchmark, but it falls far short in other JavaScript tests like Google Octane and Mozilla Kraken. That doesn't bode well, especially since two of its competitors -- the Toshiba Chromebook 2 and the entry-level Samsung Chromebook 2 -- have the same CPU, RAM allotment and screen resolution. PCMark7 3DMark06 3DMark11 ATTO (top disk speeds) HP Stream 11 (2.16GHz Intel Celeron N2840, Intel HD Graphics) 2,607 N/A E374 168 MB/s (reads); 72 MB/s (writes) You might also be excited about being able to use the standard file manager on the Stream 11, but be warned that the poky disk speeds are likely to slow down any file transfers. In the ATTO benchmark, read speeds on the 32GB flash-based disk reached an average high of 168 MB/s. Writes, meanwhile, topped out around 72 MB/s. As for multitasking, I found that the Stream 11 was sometimes slow to load desktop apps like Spotify, though I had no problem zipping through Modern-style programs I downloaded from the Windows Store. At any rate, all of this convinces me that while the performance here isn't bad for the price, the bar is definitely set higher on Windows machines than it is on Chrome devices; you can do more with them, but the performance overhead is also greater than it would be if it were running the Chrome browser as an OS. Battery life HP Stream 11 8:17 ASUS C200 11:19 Acer Chromebook 13 10:07 Dell Chromebook 11 8:37 Samsung Chromebook 2 (13-inch) 8:22 Toshiba Chromebook 8:15 Acer C720 Chromebook (Intel Core i3) 7:53 Acer C720 Chromebook (Intel Celeron) 7:49 Samsung Chromebook (2012) 6:33 HP Chromebook 11 5:08 Chromebook Pixel 4:08 (WiFi)/3:34 (LTE) You gotta hand it to HP for truth in advertising: The company says the Stream 11's 37Wh battery can last up to eight hours and 15 minutes on a charge and indeed, I logged eight hours and 17 minutes in my usual rundown test. That was with me looping a full HD video, but if you're willing to settle for good ol' standard def, you should expect closer to nine hours. All told, that's hardly the longest runtime we've seen from a Chromebook-type machine, but it's still decent, especially when you consider that the Stream 11 keeps pace with bigger machines like the 13-inch Samsung Chromebook 2. Software If you were worried that a \"lower-cost version of Windows\" meant a watered-down version, you can lay those fears to rest right now. This version -- \"Windows 8.1 with Bing,\" as it's called -- is, for all intents and purposes, the same version of Windows 8.1 that ships on every other PC. The only difference is that Bing is the pre-set search engine in Internet Explorer. Even then, you can go into the settings and switch the search engine to Google, Yahoo, et cetera; it's just that Bing needs to be the default option out of the box. As I said earlier, too, the Stream 11 comes with 1TB of OneDrive storage (free for the first year), along with a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365. (Chromebooks come with 100GB of Google Drive space for two years -- either way, that's way more space than most people could possibly need.) As a bonus too, the Stream 11 also comes with a $25 gift card to the Windows Store. Hooray! In any case, that's what Microsoft is offering, but HP threw in a few apps of its own too. These include HP Connected Photo, Connected Music and Connected Drive, none of which are as useful as they sound. Connected Photo is basically a glorified Snapfish app: Using pictures from your Snapfish and Facebook accounts, you can order prints or photo gifts using -- yep, you guessed it -- Snapfish. Connected Music, meanwhile, allows you to connect your TuneIn Radio and Beats Music accounts and create custom playlists. Nothing wrong with that, of course -- if you happen to use either of those two services. Given how few streaming services are supported, I'd just as soon steer you toward Windows' built-in Xbox Music app, which is excellent at both organizing your music collection as well as helping you discover new tracks. Finally, there's HP Connected Drive, which allows you to access your files on various devices. It's a well-intentioned idea, but here too, only certain online storage services are supported. Given that, why not just use something with wide cross-platform support? Something like, I don't know, OneDrive? Other than that, you'll also find a few third-party apps, including Amazon, TripAdvisor, Netflix and mysms, which lets you send and receive texts on your phone. The truth is, that's not a whole lot as far as extraneous programs go, but if you feel strongly about having a clean copy of Windows, you can always buy the Stream 11 through the Microsoft Store, which strips its PCs of any and all bloatware. The competition For all the talk about how the Stream 11 is supposed to be a Chromebook killer, there aren't actually that many Chromebooks to be had for $200. Other than Acer's entry-level C720 Chromebook ($200), which uses an older Celeron 2955U CPU, everything else starts at around $250. Both the 11-inch Samsung Chromebook 2 and the 13-inch Toshiba Chromebook 2 use the same processor as the Stream 11, and they start at $250 with comparable 1,366 x 768 displays. The 11-inch ASUS C200 also starts at $250, and though it's a bit slower than even your average Chromebook, it has best-in-class battery life. From there, it only gets more expensive. HP's own Chromebook 11 costs $280 with a dual-core Exynos 5250 chip and a higher-quality IPS screen. Dell's Chromebook 11 starts at $300, while Lenovo's N20p goes for a relatively pricey $330. For the money, you get a rotating, Yoga-like touchscreen that bends back slightly, but believe me when I say that the flimsy, uncomfortable keyboard is not worth the higher price. Meanwhile, though the Stream 11 is a rare breed, it's not the only Windows device you'll find in this price range. ASUS recently released the EeeBook X205, an 11-inch Windows 8.1 laptop currently going for $180. I haven't had the chance to review it, unfortunately, so I can't vouch for its performance, but I can tell you that the Intel Atom processor inside is lower-clocked than on the Stream 11, while battery life is supposedly longer: up to 12 hours, according to ASUS. Similarly, Acer's Aspire ES1 is priced at $199 and has the same CPU and 2GB of RAM as the Stream 11. I'd suggest you include that in your cross-shopping too, except I haven't tested this either, so I can't go so far as to offer a recommendation, per se. In addition to laptops, you might also consider a cheap tablet. ASUS' year-old Transformer Book T100, for instance, has seen a price cut, so that it's now just $250 at Amazon. Now it's true, the performance won't be quite as fast as on the Stream 11, but think about what you're getting here: a 10-inch tablet with nearly 11-hour battery life, and an attachable keyboard in the box. If you think you might want a touchscreen, the T100 is definitely the better pick, though I'd also warn you that the detachable keyboard there is rather cramped; when it comes to typing, the Stream 11 is still the stronger option. Wrap-up For many people, the fact that Windows laptops can run desktop apps (and work fully offline) means they're inherently better than Chromebooks, regardless of the price. As a bonus, the Stream 11 actually costs less than most Chrome OS devices, which could make it a no-brainer for some shoppers. And there's definitely something to that: The Stream 11 is a full-fledged Windows machine, but it's also portable and inexpensive, with a comfortable keyboard, cute design and surprisingly good audio. Oh, and it comes with a $25 Windows Store gift card, which, depending on how you look at it, could knock the price down to $175. Either way, it's a good deal for the money. That doesn't mean there aren't any trade-offs. The display quality is a step down from most Chromebooks. And although the Stream 11 has similar specs as a Chrome OS device, and costs about the same, there is a noticeable difference in performance: The battery life is shorter than on some competing models, and the boot-up time is slower too. That isn't necessarily a dealbreaker, but I would encourage anyone considering this to adjust their expectations. Yes, you can do more with a miniature Windows laptop like this, but because of that, you also need more power for it to run smoothly. As it stands, the Stream 11 is usable, but in the way netbooks were usable, which is to say it can be a bit poky. Then again, for $200, you might be able to forgive that. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: hp, HP Stream 11, HPStream11, microsoft, review, Stream 11, Stream11, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20998842 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20998842\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/hp/stream/11/\"> HP Stream 11 </a> HP Stream 11 Buy from $199 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/hp/stream/11/\" title=\"HP Stream 11 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 0 </a> Prices Discussions Type Ultraportable Screen size 11.6 inches Bundled OS Windows (8.1) CPU family Celeron System RAM 2 GB Hard drive(s) 32 GB\u00a0(total) Pointing device Trackpad Announced 2014-09-30 see all specs \u2192 There are not any reviews for this product yet.

It wasn't because of the sheer horsepower (there wasn't much of it) or a stunner of a screen (it was fine, at best). No, it was because the Moto X smacked of pluck. You could customize it to hell and back. It tried to improve on stock Android with software features that were actually quite useful. And the icing on the cake? It was a pure joy to hold. Motorola -- a company that basically jump-started the premium Android phone movement with the Droid before getting lost in an endless loop of modest annual upgrades -- seemed to have a pulse again. So here we are, one year later, and the X has finally gotten an upgrade to match the rest of the mobile big boys. Is it enough to make the new X a winner? Is Motorola really back?

With an impressive (not to mention customizable) design and some thoughtful software features, this is the flagship phone that Motorola should have made in the first place.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware I have a tendency to opine at length about industrial design, so here's the TL;DR if you'd rather move on with your day: The new Moto X feels a thousand times better than last year's model, and is easily the most comfortable phone current-gen smartphone I've picked up yet. As far as I'm concerned, the previous owner of that title was HTC's One M8, but there are a few factors in play that make the X even more pleasant to grip. First and foremost, Motorola's curvaceous design language is back -- the Moto X's backplate swoops a bit more dramatically than its ancestor because of the bigger 5.2-inch, 1080p AMOLED screen up front, and the end result is a phone that feels remarkably natural in the hand despite its size. It's thinner than you might think, too. Seriously, the thickest part of the hump (near the headphone jack, the 13-megapixel camera/dual-LED flash combo and the trademark Motorola dimple) comes in at just under 10mm thick, but the case tapers down to create some startlingly skinny edges -- think 3.8mm. It's a hair shorter and a hair wider than the M8, which means it fills my admittedly meaty hands better, though your mileage will, of course, vary there. While we're talking about hand-feel, Motorola ditched the all-plastic trim from the original X in favor of an aluminum band (which also acts as the antenna) that runs around the edges of the phone. You wouldn't think that so little metal would have such an impact on what it's like to hold the phone, but it does -- it imparts the X with a denser, more premium feel, and combined with the weight of the screen, it means you've got a phone that's reliably hefty, but not heavy, per se. The sheet of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protecting the display is curved at the edges too, and while that may seem like a minor design decision, it helps the X feel like it's been seamlessly put together. There have been times when I've had the X in my pocket and I'd find myself absently fingering those smooth edges. It's the little things that matter, folks. Our review unit pairs a white face with a bamboo rear cover, and the rest of the phone's design is an exercise in subtlety -- its face is devoid of extra flourishes except for the 2MP front-facing camera and the four IR sensors dotting it (they're nigh-invisible on the black version). You'll find the sleep/wake button and volume rocker on the right while the micro-USB port is centered on the phone's bottom edge. Like a slew of other flagships, the Moto X includes Qualcomm's QuickCharge 2.0 tech and Motorola says its forthcoming Turbo Charger will get you eight hours of additional battery life on a 15-minute charge. Feeling impatient? There are a handful of chargers that should do the trick right now. The thing to remember is that it's a Moto X -- it'll only ever be as subtle as you want it to be. Hate white? Think wood sucks? You're in luck: Moto Maker is just as robust as ever, so you've got no shortage of color and finish options (including Chicago-sourced leather, for you exceedingly fancy types) with which you can cobble together a Frankenphone of your very own. And then there's the stuff you can't see at all, namely the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset tucked away in that curved chassis. We'll dig into the horsepower a little later -- just know that thanks to the quad-core 2.5GHz processor, 2GB of RAM and the Adreno 330 GPU, the new Moto X will easily handle everything you throw at it. You'll be able to snag either a 16GB or a 32GB model later this month, but you should probably splurge on the latter since there's still no microSD card slot (sigh). Motorola also saw fit to trick the thing out with a non-removable 2,300mAh battery, which has been enough to get me through at least a full day (more on that later). Display and sound After being stuck with a 720p display on last year's X, I wasn't too hopeful that Motorola was capable of wowing this time around. I was wrong: The new and improved X's 5.2-inch AMOLED is one of the nicest smartphone screens I've seen in a while. Deep blacks and crisp whites? Check. Vivid colors that don't skew toward the eye-melting end of the spectrum? Double check. More-than-adequate screen brightness for outdoor use? You know where I'm going with this. Even the viewing angles are excellent -- I was able to glean most of what was going on in Paprika with my face nearly perpendicular to the screen. My only real complaint (and it's a pretty minor one) is that the glass covering the screen refracts light when you hold it at certain angles, so you have to re-orient the phone to avoid that funky rainbow effect. Most phone makers don't spend nearly as much time agonizing over speakers as they do screens, but Motorola did surprisingly well here too. The X sports just one speaker that lives up front right under the display, and it's much crisper and louder than I expected. Who knows? That might be a side effect of being disappointed by phone speakers for so long. And while we're definitely not reaching BoomSound quality, I also rarely felt I was missing out on anything. Still, it sort of smarts that Motorola snuck not one, but two speakers onto the face of the new (and less expensive) Moto G. Sure, compromises have to be made when you're trying to figure out how to squeeze lots of components into a tiny, curvy shell, but here's hoping Motorola cracks the code in time for the next-gen model. Software Android purists could really go either way on the Moto X: On one hand, it runs an almost completely stock build of Android 4.4.4 KitKat, which means it's devoid of any obnoxious overlays or gaudy third-party widgets. It's very close to Android the way Google intended it. On the other hand, just wait until you see what happens when carriers get ahold of this thing. Our demo model is tied to AT&T and so there's the usual spate of bloatware apps -- 12 to be precise, from the mildly useful (Ready2Go service isn't bad for first-time smartphone users) to the truly pointless (does anyone really use AT&T Navigator or Yellow Pages?). Thankfully, while you can't uninstall most of them, you can at least disable them. AT&T is actually known for having a lighter touch when it comes to carrier customizations, so I'm awfully curious (and a little worried) to see what the X looks like if/when carriers like Verizon and Sprint sink their claws into it. In fairness, those carrier-mandated apps aren't the only things that have been added to an otherwise pristine Android device. Motorola carried over the contextual smarts (both in the form of apps and a bit of specialized hardware) that made the original Moto X so great in spite of its shortcomings, albeit with a bit of rebranding. The first noteworthy trick -- Moto Display -- lets you see your notifications at a glance, and jump straight into the related app by swiping an icon on the dark lockscreen. The nifty part is what's going on with the display itself: Since it's an AMOLED screen, the X can fire up only the pixels that comprise the time and notification icons so it's not burning battery life every time you wave at it. Moto Actions is second, and it involves that small constellation of IR sensors on the X's face. A quick wave of the hand over the screen (the range seems to top out at about 10 inches) will silence an incoming call, or coax a sleeping screen into telling you what time it is and displaying your notifications. I still wish I could unlock the thing by waving my hand in front of it, Jedi-mind-trick-style, but alas. Constantly gesturing at your phone may seem a little obtuse (not to mention funny looking), but it isn't long before it becomes second nature. Let's be real, though: The star of the show is the X's ability to quietly listen for your voice commands, even when the screen is off. It used to be that you had to utter, \"OK, Google,\" to get your phone to pay attention, but now you can define your own command phrase. I'm a fan of keeping things casual, so after a bit of trial and error (you'll be nagged during the setup process if your magic words don't have enough syllables). I settled on the jocular \"Hey Moto, you there?\" From there, you can ask the Moto X to set alarms for you, set up reminders and post inane statuses to Facebook or WhatsApp, in addition to searching Google with your voice. If you've played with Google Now before, you know what sort of accuracy to expect (it's quite good), but my favorite use for Moto Voice is fairly mundane. You see, in the week that I've been testing the X, I've used my voice prompt nearly a dozen times just to help me find the phone when it's nestled deep in a bag, or hiding under a pile of clothes. Lo and behold, the screen almost always sprung to life and an audio cue helped me figure out where it was. There were a handful of occasions when background noise obscured my voice or I wasn't emphasizing the right words, but the X heeded my commands on the first try about 90 percent of the time. Not a bad hit rate, all things considered. Each feature on its own is neat enough, but when combined, they help make the Moto X feel like more than just a lump of metal and silicon sitting on your desk. At the risk of anthropomorphizing a gadget, calling out for the Moto X and seeing it tackle my tasks sometimes made it seem like an honest-to-goodness assistant... and not one I have to hold down a button to chat with. Sorry, Siri. Camera So far, Motorola has a done a fine job of fixing what it didn't nail with the original Moto X, but the camera experience on this year's model still isn't as consistently good as I'd hoped. The new X hosts a 13-megapixel camera (up from the 10-megapixel ClearPixel sensor we got last year) surrounded by a dual-LED ring flash, and when the sun's out or you're in a nicely lit room, your shots'll feature punchy colors and plenty of detail -- especially if you've got HDR mode on. Expect to see quite a bit of grain in all but the best-lit conditions, though, and waiting for the camera to focus properly can be an exercise in frustration sometimes. I've found it's best to enable the manual focus and exposure controls so you can just take matters into your own hands. In the event that you need to fire up the flash to throw around some more photons, you'll notice that the ring around the LEDs smooths out the otherwise harsh light, but it isn't staggeringly better than other flashes I've seen on modern smartphones. Gallery | 13 Photos Moto X (2014) sample shots + See all 13 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") On the plus side, videos shot in 1080p are generally colorful and well-exposed, and the X lets you shoot in 4K (though you'll have to offload the files onto something with a compatible display to get the full effect). The uber-simple camera interface is still a pleasure to putz around with, too. Instead of giving the camera app a discrete shutter button, you can tap anywhere on the screen to snap a photo (which can be a little odd if you're used to interfaces where you tap to focus). Holding your finger down on the screen kicks off burst mode, taking photos at a machine gun pace until you release your hold on the screen. You can dig into HDR, flash, Quick Capture, slow-motion video and panorama settings from a menu that slides out from the left side of the screen, but anyone looking for really extensive camera controls might get frustrated by the app's lack of depth. Fan as I am of the occasional selfie, the X's front-facing camera is awfully disappointing. It's not so much the quality of the photos it captured that bothered me -- though they're generally full of noise and not worth writing home about. What really killed me was the latency between moving the phone to frame a shot and seeing that movement reflected on the screen; the camera always feels like it's a half-step behind where it should be, and the amount of blur that comes into play while you're angling the phone around is really obnoxious. Performance and battery life Last year's Moto X might've been Motorola's flagship, but it lacked the sheer oomph many of its rivals did thanks to its curious chipset (a dual-core Snapdragon S4 Pro plus some additional contextual modules, remember?). That isn't the case this time. In terms of raw performance, there isn't a great difference between the Moto X and most other top-tier smartphones. That really shouldn't be a surprise: After all, the Moto X shares the high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset as heavyweights like the Galaxy S5 and the One M8. You can peep our benchmark tests below if you're the numerical sort, but what this all boils down to is that the new Moto X simply screams. There's very little you can do to stymie those formidable guts (though all the silicon in the world might not be enough to make Facebook for Android feel smooth). Swiping through web pages is fluid, as is trying to take those tricky corners in Asphalt 8, and apps launch in a jiffy. The point is, don't fret: The Moto X won't leave you wanting for horsepower. Moto X (2014) HTC One (M8) LG G3 Quadrant 2.0 22,721 25,548 25,548 Vellamo 2.0 2,093 1,804 1,405 3DMark IS Unlimited 19,568 20,612 16,662 SunSpider 1.0.2 (ms) 787 782 918 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 11.9 11.2 N/A CF-Bench 39,018 40,223 24,667 SunSpider: Lower scores are better; results compiled on Chrome. HTC One benchmarked on Android 4.4.2 Power is peachy, but we're left with another question: How long can we use it before the X runs dry? In our standard video-rundown test (looping video with WiFi on, but not connected), the next-gen X lasted for a solid 10 hours and 34 minutes before it gave up the ghost. That's only a few minutes longer than what we squeezed out of the Galaxy S5, but alas -- it still falls about an hour short of the number the HTC One M8 put up under the same conditions. Chances are your days will be just a little more involved than that, and Motorola managed to keep its word with regard to an all-day battery -- the X stuck with me for just over a day of on-and-off web browsing, texting, Kindle reading, YouTube watching, Rdio streaming and Google Maps navigating. Oh, and here's another tidbit to keep in mind: Battery performance for some original Moto Xs tanked over time, so we'll keep our eyes peeled for any long-term changes. The competition If you've made it this far, you've already discovered that the Moto X compares pretty favorably to premium phones like the One M8 and the Galaxy S5. Both of those devices cost $200 on-contract, and the 32GB Moto X probably will too (Motorola hasn't officially confirmed the price yet). There's really no wrong choice among the three, but their strengths are scattered. You're better off with the One M8 if you're a stickler for metal bodies and music -- those BoomSound speakers are the best on the market. Keen on snapping plenty of photos? If you need the best camera of the bunch and don't mind some gimmicky software, the GS5 is your pal. And if a stunning screen is your overriding concern, there's always LG's G3 to consider for the same price. With so much going on at the $199 level, why should you consider the X? Long story short: There's hardly any cruft to slow it down and it pairs thoughtfully crafted hardware with a few key features that really add to the Android experience. Fan of simplicity? You'll find plenty to like here. And hey, if you've embraced the cloud and have gigabytes of empty space floating in the digital aether waiting to be filled, you might want to opt for the 16GB model since it's only $99 on-contract. Oh, you hate service agreements? If all you're concerned about are off-contract price tags, pay close attention to the OnePlus One. It too packs an awfully similar spec sheet, along with a much larger screen and a much cheaper sticker price -- think $299, compared to the base model X's $500. Good luck getting your hands on one any time soon, though. Wrap-up Motorola's plan with last year's flagship seemed pretty clear: It set it to build a smarter kind of smartphone. The company mostly succeeded, but the formula just didn't make sense for people who wanted the most oomph for their buck. One year later and it's apparent Motorola has learned from its mistakes. This year's Moto X still isn't perfect -- the camera is occasionally just frustrating, and its battery life is purely average compared to its rivals -- but it's the closest that Motorola has come in a very long time. Moto fanatics might lament the passing of the more compact original, but don't worry: The new Moto X is the flagship Motorola should have made in the first place, and it's earned itself a spot in the pantheon of smartphone greats. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android, mobilepostcross, moto-x, motorola, motox, newmotox, review \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20960118 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20960118\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/moto/x/2nd-gen/\"> Motorola Moto X 2nd-gen </a> Motorola Moto X 2nd-gen 16GB 32GB Pure Edition 16GB Pure Edition 32GB Pure Edition 64GB Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/moto/x/2nd-gen/\" title=\"Motorola Moto X 2nd-gen reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 29 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android (KitKat [4.4]) Screen size 5.2 inches Internal memory 16 GB Carriers (US) AT&T, Verizon / Alltel, Other Dimensions 5.54 x 2.85 x 0.39 in Weight 5.08 oz Announced 2014-09-05 see all specs \u2192 8.9average user rating Reception and call quality 9.1 Display 9.7 Battery life 7.5 Camera 7.2 Ease of use 9.5 Design and form factor 9.9 Portability (size / weight) 9.4 Media support 9.2 Durability 8.9 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 8.9 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 112 How often do you upgrade your phone? 1 Is anyone getting a moto x bluetooth? 1 Confusion in buying the phone Moto G (2nd Gen) .

They're not going anywhere.\" Naysayers have been doing their thing since the notion of a curved smartphone made the leap from a nutty concept to bona fide market fad, and they're not going to stop any time soon. Neither are LG and Samsung, for that matter, who squared off in late 2013 with -- what else? -- a pair of curved phones. Neither the G Flex nor the Galaxy Round were critical or commercial hits, but they made great stepping stones as both companies tried to convince the world that curved phones were the next big thing. Now LG's back for another shot at flexible-phone glory. The new G Flex2 is smaller, sleeker and a damn sight prettier than its predecessor, but still, we've got questions. Are curved screens any less of a gimmick now? Did LG have to compromise functionality for the sake of design? And more importantly, is this actually worth buying? Gallery | 40 Photos LG G Flex2 review + See all 40 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 86 LG G Flex2 Pros Stunning design Great gaming and video performance Good camera Battery charges\u00a0quickly Cons Some stock Lollipop features are missing LG's custom UI can be sluggish Weak front-facing camera Summary The G Flex2 is LG's latest flexible flagship, and it improves on its predecessor in almost every way that matters. Style? Check. Horsepower? Check. Better screen? You get where we're going here. Still, a dramatic design refinement and an internal overhaul can't completely remove the sting from some of LG's curious software choices. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Note: I'm working with an unlocked, Korean version of the G Flex2. I'll update this review with new impressions (or hell, maybe write a brand new one) once US units become available. It's hard not to look at the original G Flex as a proof of concept, a device LG whipped up partially to fire back at its eternal rival Samsung, and partially just because it could. Once the sheer novelty of a curved phone wore off, though, you were ultimately stuck with a device that very clearly felt like the one before the one you should buy. Not so this time. The G Flex2 is leaps and bounds better than the original -- a thoughtful refinement of everything that held its ancestor back, and the nicest curved phone I've ever used (for now, anyway). Calling it the \"nicest curved phone\" seems almost like faint praise, but it'll always be known more for its curvy chassis than anything else it brings to the table. I could almost feel people's eyeballs darting to look at it, even while I was trying to be super subtle using it out in public. (One coffee shop owner got excited to the point where he asked to feel it against his face. I just couldn't turn him down.) I tested a \"Flamenco Red\" unit and it's fair to chalk some of this thing's appeal up to its gorgeous, almost burgundy finish. But I'm no fool: I know people can't keep their eyes off the curve. Look past the Flex2's unmistakable shape, though, and fans of chic, subtle design will find plenty to like. With the exception of the requisite microphone, headphone jack, a micro-USB port down below and a teensy IR blaster up top, the Flex2's edges are completely empty. That won't surprise anyone who's so much as looked at one of LG's recent smartphones: The company's once again crammed the volume and power buttons onto the phone's back, below the main 13-megapixel camera and laser autofocus module. Does it take a little getting used to? Sure. Thing is, once you've gotten a feel for the button placement, you might start to wonder why every phone maker doesn't do this. My index finger naturally cradles the phone's back while holding it anyway, making LG's non-traditional layout seem like a no-brainer. Once you pop that backplate off, you're suddenly made privy to the lovely world of expandable memory thanks to a microSD card slot nestled right on top of the micro-SIM tray. Yeah, it might seem like a minute thing to get worked up over, but dang it, I still like throwing in memory cards when I need more room for Sherlock episodes and I suspect you do, too. The review unit LG provided has 32GB of internal memory, though there's a slightly lower tier version that ships with 16GB of storage instead -- we'll see if that one makes it stateside. Right, back to the obvious. That coiled body has serious implications for how the Flex2 feels: It snuggles to your face more comfortably than your run-of-the-mill candy-bar phone, for one. The pronounced curve coupled with a bigger screen meant the original G Flex could be an awkward fit for your skinny jeans, but even that seems like less of a problem this time around; the Flex2 hugged the curve of my thigh so well that I forgot it was there most of the time. That's great news if you're tired of feeling sturdy bricks pressing into your legs -- just remember to check your pockets before you start tossing things into the laundry. The whole package now feels much less cumbersome thanks in large part to LG's decision to use a noticeably smaller (not to mention higher-resolution) 5.5-inch P-OLED screen. So yes, we get it; it's curved. Better question: Does it still flex as well as it used to? More or less. There's enough give that you could flatten its face against a surface if you had the finger strength for it, but that's definitely not something LG wants you doing on the regular. The company hasn't said how much weight you can apply without dredging up bad memories of Bendgate, though at the company's pre-CES briefing, one LG staffer gleefully threw his unit on the (carpeted) floor and essentially buttslammed it. My testing was a little less theatrical, but the results were basically the same: It stood up to being smushed in a tight bag and I indeed sat on it from time to time without feeling like I was putting the phone in mortal danger. You definitely don't need to treat this thing with kid gloves, but that obviously doesn't mean you should go out of your way to be a jerk to it, either. That same philosophy extends to the Flex2's updated self-healing back, which LG says repairs minor nicks in as quickly as ten seconds. I didn't have an old G Flex kicking around to compare it with, but LG's mostly right on the money. The sort of tiny scratches that appear on your phones as a result of bag debris and pocket schmutz ironed themselves out quickly. Furiously rubbing my thumb against the blemishes made them disappear even faster (though I had to give the phone a thorough wiping down after; it'll suck your fingerprints off from across the room). Just don't expect any miracles if/when you drop the thing -- my G Flex2 fell onto and skittered across concrete during a photo shoot, and its corner was just as gouged as any other phone's would be. Display One of the best decisions LG made this time around was to ditch the G Flex's 6-inch panel. Instead, a curved, 5.5-inch, 1080p P-OLED display sits front and center, and -- surprise, surprise -- it's a huge improvement over the 2013 model. In fact, let's just get the numbers out of the way now: The G Flex2's screen squeezes about 403 pixels into each linear inch, up from 245 ppi on its predecessor. It's a night-and-day difference, and one that was inevitable when you consider just how young curved-screen tech was just over a year ago (and how expensive it was to work with). Sure, it might not be as insanely crisp as the G3's screen, but our days of picking out individual pixels on a curved display are over. Of course, none of that would mean a thing if the screen was somehow awful at everything else. Don't worry: It's not. Out of the box, the display is crisp and bright with deep blacks and mostly punchy colors that'll draw your eyes in even closer. If anything, I'd say the screen skews a bit muted, but LG's got us covered there too: You can swap among default, \"Vivid\" and \"Natural\" color-temperature presets from within the settings. I'm a fan of giving my retinas a light sear, so for me, the Vivid setting was just the ticket; the screen instantly grew more saturated, though not to the point where it was overly lurid. Viewing angles are excellent too, even though you'll see whites take on a sort of bluish cast when you peek at the screen from awkward angles. Once again, we've got the curve to thank for the screen's easy visibility, but it's maybe not the game changer LG claims it is. From up close, the curve is so subtle that you'll barely notice it at all; it's no more \"immersive\" than any other big-screened phone I've ever come across. It's just not. That's a strike against LG's marketing department, but your stuff's going to look great here anyway -- just be wary of the hype train. Meanwhile, all your tunes issue forth from a single speaker wedged into the Flex2's backside, and it's better than I expected. Years of listening to Mika and The Blue Hearts through tiny, tinny drivers have set the audio bar pretty low for me, but the G Flex2 managed to clear it with room to spare. As you'd expect from a single-speaker setup, there's a noticeable lack of depth to what you're listening to, and indeed, some parts of a track get completely overshadowed by others. Suffice to say, it's not at all about nuance. It is about being loud, though, and my test tunes and go-to YouTube videos -- this kid reviewing pizzas and stuff -- came through with plenty of oomph. Software LG made sure the G Flex2 is the sort of phone that turns heads, but the company also seemed content to play it safe with the software. In fact, if you weren't paying close attention, you might think you picked up a G3 instead; save for a few additions, they basically do all the same things. You can still pin two native apps (out of an available 11) onto the top and bottom halves of the screen for easier multitasking, while a quick double-tap on the G Flex2's screen will rouse it from its sleep. If that's not secure enough for you, try tapping out your personal, predefined Knock Code on-screen to prove you are you who claim to be. Need something to make sure you're getting off your bum often enough? LG Health still serves as a decent companion, counting your steps and plotting your meandering walks on a map for later dissection. You get where I'm going with this. New phone, same old interface. Even the company's Google Now competitor, Smart Notice, is back and doesn't seem much smarter than before. It'll still proffer suggestions when it knows the weather is icky, and remind you of the occasional friend's birthday so you don't look like a jerk. Out of the box, it doesn't do much at all, but give it a few days and Smart Notice will quietly pick up your habits. If you keep calling an unsaved number, for instance, it'll ask if you want to store it in your contacts. I also managed to have a brief conversation with the phone's QVoice digital assistant, despite something of a language barrier. The voice coming out of the Flex2 sounded remarkably natural, and the only thing keeping me from trying to engage \"her\" longer was the fact that she only spoke Korean and I know all of three phrases: \"hello,\" \"thank you\" and \"I love you.\" Thankfully, Google Now was just a swipe away, so I could issue commands to a service that actually understood the words I was spewing. All told, there are two notable changes to the mix here. The first is Glance View, which lets you peek at the time and your notifications without decimating the battery in the process. Rather than tap the lock button to light up the entire screen, you can now swipe down from the bezel above the display for a quick look at that vital info (complete with a cutesy sunlight effect). Peeking only lights up the uppermost quarter of the display to save power, but the \"shade\" you pull down always takes an extra moment to catch up to where your finger is. Nitpicky? Possibly. Mildly irksome? You bet. The other change is even more fundamental. Lots of LG's little flourishes will look familiar, but peel back the surface and you'll see Google's Android 5.0.1 Lollipop running underneath. With it comes a slew of helpful additions that LG had no part in designing -- things like Google's Material Design UI, complete with a flat aesthetic, lockscreen notifications and cards everywhere. Here's the thing, though: Some of Lollipop's most useful tidbits, like the Guest Mode and the ability to selectively prioritize notifications for apps can be tricky to find if you're used to Android 5.0 proper. It's not unusual for companies to put their own spin on Android before pushing it out the door, but Google made some serious leaps forward with Lollipop, and it's a little frustrating to find them futzed with. Camera We've said it before and we'll say it again: The original G Flex's camera wasn't all that great. We know it; you know it; and LG knows it. Rather than try and reinvent the wheel (err, sensor), the company essentially plucked the 13-megapixel rear camera from the G3 and transplanted it into the G Flex2. Frankly, it was a welcome move. LG didn't have to do much to clear the original Flex's low bar, but the combination of the G3 sensor and a high-speed laser autofocus system makes the Flex2 a clear improvement. The images I snapped were all crisp and detailed, not to mention well-exposed in most cases. It's all too common to see photos captured with phones take a quality nosedive when things get dim, but the Flex2 did equally well when I ducked under an overpass for some darker shots. Given that I'm sort of a klutz and am always rushing to snap a photo in the nick of time, the camera's optical image stabilization was a godsend, salvaging a few shots I thought I'd bungled. I can't be the only one who fits that description; the trembly fingered reading this might want to give this phone a second look.

Unless you tap those telltale ellipses in the corner, all you get to work with are a Back button and a tiny, circular overlay that shows your most recent shots. Need to snap a photo? Just give that screen a tap -- the speedy autofocus will kick in and the phone takes a picture. Curiously, opening up the Settings basically turns the Camera app into a completely different beast. Tapping the screen just sets the focus, leaving you to press the discrete shutter button to add a photo to your portfolio. There isn't much in the way of options, either; all you've got are your usual grid, timer and HDR modes, along with the ability to shoot a panorama or snap a photo with both cameras at the same time. As usual, the front-facing selfie camera isn't worth writing home about... or at least it wouldn't be, were it not for a few nifty features. If the hand you're not using to hold the phone gets tied up, saying \"Cheese,\" \"Kimchi\" or \"Whiskey\" (my favorite, natch) coaxes the camera into snapping that tricky shot. And if your other hand is free? Just slowly clench your fist in front of the camera; it'll take that as a sign to start the timer and let 'er rip. Once that's all done, bringing the phone down and closer to you automatically kicks the thing into gallery mode, showing you the shot you just painstakingly captured. The end result won't be that great (especially if your features are blurred and smeared by the built-in Beauty mode), but at least getting it was a cakewalk. Performance and battery life My mom always said that it's what's inside that counts (perhaps to console herself for having such a derpy-looking child). As it turns out, what's inside the G Flex2 is one hotly contested bit of silicon. Meet Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810, the 2GHz octa-core chipset that's been beset for months by reports of overheating and production woes. It got so bad that the chip was supposedly snubbed by LG's rival Samsung in favor of an in-house design, leading to... a pretty awkward earnings call. The G Flex2 is the first handset in the world to ship with one of these things onboard, and its launch in Korea just happened to coincide with more reports claiming the chip ran too hot... followed by another saying it's actually cooler than its predecessor. So, how does it fare in the real world? Pretty well for the most part. Just to get a decent sense of how the chip's thermal throttling affected the device's overall performance, I ran the following series of benchmarks on the Flex2 three times in a row after a fresh boot, three more times after playing Asphalt for about 15 minutes and then averaged them. Take a look. LG G Flex2 Samsung Galaxy Note Edge Moto X (2014) iPhone 6 Plus AndEBench Pro 7,167 8,886 N/A N/A Vellamo 3.0 4,684 1,882 2,093 N/A 3DMark IS Unlimited 22,207 19,912 19,568 17,902 SunSpider 1.0 (ms) 667 788 787 388 GFXBench 3.0 1080p Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 21 18.4 11.9 18.2 CF-Bench 68,426 40,143 39,018 N/A SunSpider: Lower scores are better. Some tests varied more than others during my tests; GFXBench results barely budged while CF-Bench swung between 54,000 and 73,000 presumably because of throttling. Still, even with the potential for heat-related issues factored in, the G Flex2 outperformed its closest curvy competitor in most tests. But what does all that mean in terms of actually using the thing? On one hand, whipping around corners and getting into wrecks in Asphalt 8: Airborne looked beautiful, even after I cranked up the visual effects as far as they'd go. Ditto for Dead Trigger 2: I idly plowed through zombie hoards without a dropped frame or a visual hiccup in sight. The G Flex2's top half got warm when I started putting it through the wringer, but it never felt uncomfortable in my hands, even in the midst of a prolonged gaming session. So far, so good, right? Then, every once in a while, it would seem like the home screens were coated with molasses: They'd either transition really slowly, or just get stuck for a moment before finally moving along. Removing the default Smart Notice widget did wonders, but the issue still popped up whenever I had too many apps going at once; 2GB of RAM isn't always enough to keep this thing running smoothly all the time. And then there are the weird little things. The phone would sometimes avoid \"poor connections\" like my home WiFi network, even though a few moments later it indicated I had an \"excellent\" connection. So yes, the Flex 2 can be flaky sometimes. I've been testing the thing for the better part of the week, but I'll keep my eye on the situation to see how it changes over time. For what it's worth, LG has offered the following statement on the matter: \"The devices sampled are representative of final industrial design and user experience but are continuing to undergo additional optimizations to enhance benchmark performance. We expect our upcoming software releases to provide further improvements in this area.\" Thankfully, the battery isn't as persnickety as the rest of the phone: It typically managed about 13 hours on a single charge, all while I was futzing around in HipChat and Hangouts, firing off emails from CloudMagic and playing the occasional documentary in the background on YouTube. When it came time for our standard video-rundown test (all together now: looping a 720p video with screen brightness set to 50 percent), the new G Flex held out for ten hours and 13 minutes before needing a top-up. As it turns out, the charger's no slouch either; it takes the phone from 0 to 50 percent in about an hour, and it'll top off the battery completely in less than an hour after that. The competition Let's face it: If you're really jonesing for a curved phone, your options are limited. The G Flex2 is going to hit AT&T and Sprint sometime this month, but neither carrier has released any pricing details just yet. For now, that means your only shot at nabbing one is importing it from South Korea where it retails for 800,000 Korean won, or just above $720. That sounds like a bitter pill to swallow, but it's still better than paying full price for something like the Galaxy Note Edge; AT&T's asking for $946 for that device off-contract. With a launch window right around the corner, shelling out cash for the original G Flex would be absolute lunacy, and you really shouldn't buy a Galaxy Round either. The allure of a dramatically designed phone can be hard to resist, but the LG G3 is a worthy stand-in if you're not looking for a status symbol. It shares a camera and most of its software flourishes with the Flex2, and it sports a Quad HD screen and a lower price tag off-contract, to boot. Of course, you might want to hold off on any sort of purchasing decision for now anyway. Mobile World Congress is creeping up faster than I'd like, which means new flagship phones from Samsung and HTC are barreling down the pipeline as I type this. HTC's supposed M9 isn't expected to have a curved screen (though reports do claim it'll sport a Snapdragon 810 too), but Samsung just might pull back the curtain on a Galaxy S6 Edge in Barcelona. True curve devotees might not be swayed by either option -- still, your best bet is to wait a little while longer and see what happens when the new phones launch and all the dust settles. Wrap-up With the original G Flex, LG had some great ambitions that were ultimately hampered by reality -- the reality of complexity, of production, of price. Want to see a phone that was just a little too ahead of its time? Look no further than the G Flex2. It's honestly a little surprising how much difference a year makes, and LG has used that time wisely. The second-gen edition is prettier and more comfortable, with a much-improved screen and horsepower to spare. In short, it's a pretty great phone independent of its curvy frame. That's not to say it's perfect, obviously. Certain stock Android features have been omitted, and it can be curiously sluggish from time to time. Some will wish for a beefier battery, and others will clamor to find fault with the chip tucked away inside. (I'll keep on the lookout for issues and update this review if things get hairy.) Still, the balance of style and performance here is nothing to scoff at, and with any luck this'll get a competitive price tag when it hits the United States. Expect some new insights when that happens, but know this: You'll soon be able to buy another curvy phone that doesn't feel half-baked. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: curved, CurvedSmartphone, gflex2, lg, LGGFlex2, mobilepostcross, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21143628 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21143628\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lg/g-flex/2/\"> LG G Flex 2 </a> LG G Flex 2 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lg/g-flex/2/\" title=\"LG G Flex 2 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android (Lollipop [5.0]) Screen size 5.5 inches Camera 13\u00a0megapixels Announced 2015-01-05 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Reception and call quality 10 Display 10 Battery life 8 Camera 8 Ease of use 8 Design and form factor 10 Portability (size / weight) 10 Media support 10 Durability 10 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 8 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 0 What is the best screen protector for LG G Flex 2?

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/28/tesco-hudl2-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "October 28th 2014 at 9:00 am", "body": " A supermarket turned tablet maker doesn't sound like the wisest of career progressions. Tesco's not your average supermarket, though. When you consider the Tesco machine also operates video- and music-streaming services, an e-book store and an online emporium selling everything from garden furniture to jewelry, having a low-cost, own-brand tablet to publicise them on makes a considerable amount of sense. Amazon makes it work with a similar potpourri of digital properties, after all. Tesco first explored the idea with its \u00a3119 Hudl tablet, launched around this time last year. And, having shifted over three quarters of a million units during that period, it's hoping to keep the ball rolling with the new Hudl2, which boasts a bigger display, upgraded hardware, a more refined look and a similarly wallet-friendly \u00a3129 price tag. Tesco's still a fish in the tablet game, and yet, with the Hudl2, it's managed to deliver not just another great value product, but also the best affordable slate on the market right now. Gallery | 30 Photos Tesco Hudl2 review + See all 30 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 85 Tesco Hudl2 Pros Great build quality Beautiful 1080p display Superb performance Robust parental controls Exceptional value for the money Cons Short battery life Heavy for a tablet this size Underwhelming stereo speakers Summary Tesco\u2019s Hudl2 tablet is a vast improvement over its predecessor. It\u2019s well-built, with a lovely 8.3-inch 1080p display, and performs impeccably, whether you\u2019re browsing the web or playing processor-intensive 3D games. First-time tablet buyers will appreciate its user-friendly approach, while parents will like its robust child-safety measures. Despite short battery life and mediocre cameras, at \u00a3129 the Hudl2 is currently the best value tablet available in the UK.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware As Tesco did with the first Hudl, the company has kept the unboxing process as Luddite-friendly as possible. The tablet's plastic screen guard explains the meaning of all ports and buttons, while separate labeled compartments in the box clarify the difference between a USB cable and a wall plug. Meanwhile, there's a picture-driven manual on hand to walk you through the initial setup and basic features. Freephone numbers for the Hudl2 support line are also printed on the well of the packaging in case you need any assistance from the get-go. Once unwrapped, the Hudl2 looks more like a distant cousin to its predecessor than a direct relation. Gone are the overgenerous bezels and soft curves, supplanted by a squarer, more distinguished appearance you may be less inclined to let sticky fingers run amuck on. Using the same building materials, Tesco's nipped and tucked its way to creating a slate with all the visual appeal and finesse you might expect from a more experienced manufacturer. The shiny, embossed Hudl logo is pretty much the only familiar design element to have made the cut. Most of the Hudl2 is clad in hard, durable plastic that has a slight rubbery texture to give your fingers some extra purchase. It covers the back, sides and spills over to the front to fill any space not covered by glass. My review unit's cloaked in a modest, dark grey plastic, but there are also white and vibrant red, pink, orange, purple and blue models available for those who want something with a little more personality. If you were in any doubt what orientation you're supposed to hold the tablet in, the direction of the reflective Hudl logo on the back panel tells you it's primarily intended for landscape use. Beneath that is a discreet, light grey \"From Tesco\" banner alongside small print like the model number, et cetera. The top-rear corners of the device are home to stereo speaker grilles, with one a tad smaller than the other to leave space for the main camera lens. Both grilles are made from several circular holes poked in the plastic shell, and could almost be considered ornate compared to the first Hudl's simpler, slit pattern. They also sit higher on the back this time around, away from your hands. The front of the device is dominated by the Hudl2's 8.3-inch display, with the front-facing camera and a large charging notification LED off to the left. On the top edge, you'll find the power key and volume rocker, while the opposite border hosts a HDMI Micro-out socket and microSD card slot. The headphone jack and micro-USB port for charging/data transfer are positioned on the left and right edges, respectively. The Hudl2 might be an all-plastic affair, but there's nothing cheap about its build quality. The seam that runs along the plastic perimeter of the device is consistently tight; the power button and volume rocker sit almost flush with the top edge and don't wiggle around in their sockets; and every port hole is neatly cut. You have to expend a fair amount of energy to get any flex out of the device, and even then, it won't creak or squeal in protest. Overall, it's a very well put-together tablet, and the fact it's also a relatively heavy tablet makes it feel extra sturdy. With a weight of 410g, however, the Hudl2 is substantially heftier than its 370g predecessor. The increase isn't totally unexpected given the larger screen, but Android tablets in the 7- to 8-inch range don't tend to go above the 350g mark, making the Hudl2 one of the heavier members of its peer group. It's something to keep in mind when clumsy tykes with delicate toes are in command, but grown-ups shouldn't find its weight too much of a problem. Chances are it'll be resting on your knees, a table or propped up in a case the majority of the time, but as long as you have somewhere to rest your elbows, you can easily clutch it with two hands for extended periods of use. One-handed operation is where things start to get a little uncomfortable, though. It's simply too heavy to hold freely for any length of time, especially if you're trying to tap out an extensive email. This is particularly true in landscape orientation, as the tablet's wide enough that its centre of gravity is constantly working against your best efforts to keep it stable. Despite its larger screen, Tesco's newer tablet is ever so slightly shorter and thinner than the first-gen Hudl, but a good 30mm wider. The height saving is down to a leaner bezel above and below the display. The bezel to the left and right of the screen is much healthier, but it doesn't look bloated or out of proportion. If anything, they're parking spaces for your thumbs that keep them from obstructing the view. If you feel Tesco deserves more than \u00a3129 for its latest tablet, you can always supplement that purchase with any of the various accessories the supermarket has to offer. You have your pick of black leather or colourful \"soft touch\" (polyurethane) folio cases, shells that look like a chaotic version of Apple's iPhone 5c case and chunkier \"bumper\" covers for butterfingered kids. Hudl-branded styli and headphones are also available if you're ready to fully commit to the Hudl brand.

Black, blue, red and purple Display and audio The most significant upgrade to the second iteration of Hudl hardware has to be its display. It's not only bigger at 8.3 inches, but also sports a higher, 1,920 x 1,200 resolution (273 ppi). This means you're always looking at a glorious, full HD (1080p) image, with those surplus pixels making room for the on-screen Android navigation keys. Numbers don't always tell the full story, but the Hudl2's panel is a good-quality one, too. Colours are realistic and well-saturated; whites are pure; and blacks are pretty much as good as they get where LCD technology is concerned. The display also has excellent viewing angles, so anyone huddled close to the screen (get it?!) will be getting more or less the same experience as the person directly in front of it. There's not much else to say apart from it's a great device to view media on. Sunlight readability is really the only minor flaw here. The screen's brightness setting goes high enough to cope with the artificial lighting in your home or local cafe, but it's not so powerful that it can cut through the sun's rays on a cloudless day. Don't get me wrong, you'll still be able to frame that picture of you and your chums picnicking on your favourite London field, but glare will become a frustration if you want to polish off that e-book you've been reading on a park bench. The quality of sound the Hudl2's onboard stereo speakers are capable of producing is pretty underwhelming. For starters, they're facing away from the screen, giving audio a distant, rather than immersive feel. What does get thrown out lacks clear definition and any semblance of deep bass. Higher-frequency tones, on the other hand, are overly edgy to the point of being raspy and abrasive. The speakers can kick out more volume than you'll realistically ever need, but in terms of quality, they're more suited to providing audio for funny YouTube clips than feature-length films or impromptu raves. Plug a set of headphones into the \"Dolby-optimised\" Hudl2, however, and it becomes a completely different beast. Audio quality instantly goes from mediocre to superb. Sound is well-balanced and highly defined. And every subtle bass tone comes through perfectly, making the tablet a joy to watch a movie or listen to music on. You certainly won't be left wanting in the volume department, either. Software The Hudl2 runs, for the most part, a stock build of Android 4.4.2 KitKat. As much as Tesco wants you to buy its hardware, the supermarket is just as keen to tie you up in its software and services. Like the first Hudl, this means there's a fair amount of Tesco-issued bloatware populating the device. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for first-time tablet users, though, as they can do a lot with the slate right out of the box. For true beginners, there's a slick instructions app that explains how to customize the tablet, hop online, listen to music, take a picture and other basics. This is complemented by an app that lists some recommended games, streaming services, news outlets and the like to get you started. Gallery | 30 Photos Tesco Hudl2 software + See all 30 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Once you're up and running, the hope is that you'll start to explore Tesco's Blinkbox video, music and e-book services. The e-book store is, well, exactly what it sounds like, and Blinkbox music lets you stream millions of tunes bound in artist- and theme-driven \"stations.\" It's a free, ad-supported service, but sign up to the premium tier for \u00a31 per week and you can create your own playlists, listen to specific albums and, of course, cut ads out of the equation. Blinkbox skips the subscription model when it comes to streaming video, instead offering movies and TV box sets for purchase or rental. Recently, Tesco also started letting you link UltraViolet libraries to Blinkbox accounts, allowing you to stream the digital copies of any supported DVDs and Blu-rays you own to the Hudl2 (and all other devices that have a Blinkbox app). To tempt you onto the hook, every Hudl2 purchase includes 25 quid's worth of bait credit to spend across the three services. As well as offering content for you to consume on the Hudl2, Tesco runs a bank, photo-printing service and grocery/fashion/everything else stores that are all predictably easy to access on the tablet. Only a couple have dedicated apps, but a folder on the Hudl2's home screen contains website shortcuts to anything that doesn't. Not content with simply preinstalling its apps, Tesco's also added a non-removable panel to the home screen carousel called \"My Tesco.\" It looks and functions a lot like Google Now, with a dynamic, card-based UI. These cards suggest content to stream, recipes to try, Hudl2 accessories to buy and highlight the top deals at Tesco's various stores. It shows you what time your nearest supermarket closes, and if you can plug in your Blinkbox, Clubcard and Groceries account details, it'll also tell you what time your online food order will be delivered, how many loyalty points you've racked up and other personalised info. A static menu you can get to from within the \"My Tesco\" pane again points you in the direction of every Tesco store and service available. Really, it just collates many of the apps and shortcuts found elsewhere and presents them in a more accessible way. Tesco's custom home screen panel is more or less a dedicated advertising space, though I can see it being useful to those fully entrenched in the supermarket's retail and service ecosystem. But, if you're not at that stage, \"My Tesco\" is easily ignored as long as you don't touch the T button or swipe right on the home screen. The anchored home screen pane is pretty much the only visual customisation from Tesco that sits on top of stock Android. Other than that, there are a few prepositioned widgets you can easily remove, and an overly positive default wallpaper depicting a group of friends apparently on a surfing trip in the middle of a field. Tesco's latest tablet is pitched as a device for the whole family. The original Hudl was too, but its child-safety measures amounted to an on-device guide of what settings to change, and what apps parents could use to control what their little ones were able to access. This time around, Tesco's built a more comprehensive solution that's similar to Amazon's Kindle FreeTime feature. You can create individual profiles for each child in the household, and then choose what types of websites they're allowed to access from a list of categories. There's also a whitelist for each profile, so you can allow specific sites that might come under a wider category of content you'd rather your kids avoid. You can also set weekday and weekend time limits on general usage, as well as specify what apps will show up on the device for each profile. Furthermore, there's an advice section within the child-safety app that talks about everything you should consider when letting young'uns loose on the slate. Overall, the new measures are a big improvement over the first Hudl, and for parents, it could be considered more of a selling point than a simple app. Camera Taking pictures on tablets doesn't do anything for your street cred, but we get it: Sometimes, the Hudl2 may be the only camera-equipped device to hand. Tesco's bumped the main camera up to five megapixels, from 3MP on the first Hudl, but curiously, it's done the opposite with the front-facing unit. What used to be a 2-megapixel shooter is now only 1.2MP, which is kind of strange given that you're more likely to use a tablet for video calling than you are to shoot landscape stills. Gallery | 36 Photos Tesco Hudl2 camera samples + See all 36 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") The Hudl2's camera app is extremely basic. You've only got still, video, panorama, photo sphere and lens blur modes, the latter of which can be used to inject bokeh into macro shots. The only things you can do from within the viewfinder are add a framing grid and set a countdown timer, but even in the deeper settings menu, you can only adjust the resolution and quality of images each lens spits out. Head to the \"advanced\" section of this menu, and you'll find an option to add a manual exposure setting to the viewfinder -- everything else is taken care of automatically. I don't consider this a negative, though, because who really wants to faff around with white balance and scene-selection settings when you're simply trying to grab an opportunistic shot on your tablet? Camera performance on the first Hudl was thoroughly disappointing, but the Hudl2 demonstrates some notable improvements. Firstly, image quality is better by default thanks to the higher resolution. Beyond that, though, colours are way more vibrant and realistic in scenarios where natural light is on your side. Shutter speed and response times are pretty good, too. Some photos still come out a little overexposed and washed out, and the auto-white balance setting isn't always accurate (especially when shooting landscapes), but more often than not, you'll be happy with the output. The main camera doesn't fare so well with artificial lighting. Images tend to be either extremely washed out, or take on the general hue of whatever bulb's illuminating the scene. In twilight, the camera simply jacks the exposure setting up to its maximum, resulting in horribly pale images. In much darker situations, however, you get a more realistic image even if it is on the grainy side. At this light level, though, the shutter speed has dropped so low you need to hold the tablet steady for well over a second to achieve anything but a blurry mess. I don't have a great deal of positive things to say about the Hudl2's 1.2MP front-facing camera. On a bright, sunny day, it'll take a perfectly good selfie, but stray from those ideal conditions and image noise starts to become a real issue. This is particularly true in low-light situations, where banding noise turns photos into streaky mosaics. The front-facing shooter is capable of recording 720p video, while the main camera can capture clips at 1080p. Don't let the resolutions fool you, though, as they're not particularly handy in this department. The front-facer has the same problems with video as it does with stills, and the primary camera doesn't do a markedly better job. While the frame rate of video is fine, noticeable pixelation and fidgety autofocus/exposure settings mean you won't want to use the Hudl2 to capture any meaningful moments. The quality of recorded audio is quite simply terrible, with ill-defined sound all but hidden under the loud hiss of static. (Full-resolution camera sample images can be found here.) Performance and battery life A more sophisticated design and a bigger, better display aren't the only enhancements Tesco's bestowed upon its second-generation tablet. The Hudl2 also has a faster quad-core 1.33GHz Intel Atom processor (with turbo boost up to 1.83GHz), this time paired with 2GB of RAM, double the amount of memory its predecessor offered. It also has the same 16GB of internal storage as the first Hudl, with a microSD card slot allowing you to add more. Tesco says the slate is compatible with cards as large as 32GB, but then again, it said the same about the original Hudl, yet that handled a 64GB card without issue. Sadly, I don't have anything of that size on hand to test whether the Hudl2 is capable of the same overachievement. The Hudl2 has all the processing power it needs to deal with typical tablet use cases effortlessly. I'm talking about cycling through the app drawer, jumping into Gmail, browsing YouTube -- that sort of thing. It's generally a slick and responsive affair, though I did notice a few infrequent hiccups. Occasionally, the on-screen keyboard would take a split second longer to appear than normal, for example, or the tablet would hang briefly when switching from the lockscreen to the home screen. These minor indiscretions have practically no impact on the general user experience, though. On a related note, the transition from the normal home screen to the immovable \"My Tesco\" pane isn't a particularly smooth one. It stutters across to fill the screen, but I'm certain this is down to poor optimisation on Tesco's part, rather than any fault of the hardware. Browsing the web on the Hudl2 is a great experience, making it a perfect couch-surfing companion. Sites load quickly on the device (using the Chrome browser), and I haven't noticed any scroll lag, tiling or other performance issues of that nature. I wasn't sure the Intel Atom chip would deal with processor-intensive tasks as well, but my reservations were unfounded. The 3D games Real Racing 3 and Shadowgun: Deadzone run fantastically, and Asphalt 8: Airborne only starts dropping frames when pushed to the highest graphics setting (it's fine on the recommended medium setting). When running power-hungry apps, the tablet does have a tendency to heat up around the primary camera lens, so prepare for your left palm to get sweaty during extended gaming sessions. Aside from this observation, I'd be lying if I said I expected Tesco's \u00a3129 tablet to perform as well as it does in all areas. The Hudl2's connectivity options aren't exhaustive, but it's got everything a regular punter will need: dual-band WiFi 802.11a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS/GLONASS (it's a WiFi-only tablet, remember, so it isn't exactly an ideal satnav replacement). The tablet also has a HDMI Micro-out port, so you can mirror its screen on your living room TV with the right cable. For whatever reason, Tesco doesn't specify the actual capacity of the batteries in either of its tablets. The Hudl2 is said to be good for up to eight hours of use, but in the standard Engadget video-looping test, it only managed six and a half before giving up the ghost. The original Hudl (which Tesco claimed had a nine-hour battery life) didn't do too much better, clocking in a time of just over seven hours. (Neither result is particularly impressive, but several, admittedly older, Android tablets have put in comparable performances.) Under normal usage conditions at medium screen brightness, you can expect to get roughly six hours of Hudl2 time before needing to recharge. Run a lot of processor-intensive apps and games, however, and you're looking at more like four hours. The Hudl2's battery life is definitely one of its weakest points, and you wouldn't want the tablet as your sole source of entertainment on a long-haul flight. That being said, if it's going to spend most of its life on the living room coffee table, I doubt you'll find plugging it in every other evening a huge inconvenience.

If it's something a little more affordable you're after, however, then your options start to become more limited. At \u00a3129, the Hudl2 is one of only a few truly wallet-friendly slates available in the UK right now. Currently, its closest competition is Amazon's Fire HD 7, which starts at \u00a3119 for the 8GB model. The extra tenner you pay for the Hudl2 is certainly worth it, though, as Tesco's tablet is simply better in every respect -- barring, perhaps, battery life. It has a bigger, higher-resolution display, better cameras and a faster processor, not to mention it has a more open Android OS built with access to the Google Play store. A couple of UK carriers have recently added new, low-cost tablets to their device repertoires. Vodafone's started selling its own-brand Smart Tab 4G for \u00a3125 on pay-as-you-go, while EE now offers the Alcatel OneTouch Pop 7S for \u00a3100 all-in. Obviously, these slates have LTE connectivity, which isn't something you can say about the Hudl2. Tesco's tab trumps both when it comes to raw specs, though, making it the more sensible purchase if having internet access on the move isn't your top priority. If you're not much of a tablet gamer, and simply want a device to do the basics on, like web browsing and the odd email, then picking up a first-generation Hudl might be the way to go. Following the launch of the Hudl2, Tesco's discounted its first-gen tablet to the bargain price of \u00a379 while it still has leftover stock to shift. Amazon's newer Fire HD 6 tablet (8GB model) retails for the same price, though, and may be the preferred option if you'd be content with Fire OS and want a slate with long battery life. Both of the supermarket's tablets are eligible for \"Clubcard Boost,\" which means your loyalty points are worth double their normal amount when put toward a purchase of either slate. A first-gen Hudl is therefore only \u00a340 when bought with Clubcard points, but if you've managed to amass \u00a365, I'd suggest the newer, better Hudl2. At \u00a3129 in real money, the Hudl2 is already the best value tablet around. If you do happen to have \u00a365 in points lying dormant in your Clubcard account, though, then the Hudl2 is an absolute steal. Wrap-up Tesco's in a rather unique position -- it's a brand trusted for providing millions of Brits with the everyday essentials, meaning it has a huge captive audience to sell the Hudl2 and its digital services to. The supermarket's been clever to make its second-gen slate as technophobe-friendly as its first, while also improving child-safety measures to appeal to families that plan to share a single device. With both of these selling points, and a target market that may not be au fait with all the other tablet options out there, Tesco isn't under the same level of pressure to compete in the spec wars as other manufacturers are. And yet, it's crafted a product that's not only attractive to regular consumers looking for an affordable tablet, but also to the type of person, like me, who's interested in pixel density and processor speeds. The truth is, you get a hell of a lot for your money. A gorgeous 8.3-inch display makes the Hudl2 a fantastic tablet to consume media on, complemented by superb audio quality when you've got headphones plugged in. The tablet might be made from relatively cheap materials, but it's well-designed with robust build quality. It's no slouch under the hood either, with all the processing power it needs to handle casual browsing and 3D gaming alike. Yes, Tesco bloatware is hiding in every nook and cranny, but you can simply ignore anything you don't want to use and enjoy the full stock Android experience. Now, the Hudl2's battery life is nothing to write home about, and its stereo speakers could be better. But, all things considered, the Hudl2 is hands-down the best value tablet you can buy in the UK right now. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Origin:Engadget UK Tags: hudl, hudl2, review, tablet, tesco, tescohudl, uk, uk-feature, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20983918 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20983918\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/tesco/hudl/\"> Tesco Hudl </a> Tesco Hudl Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/tesco/hudl/\" title=\"Tesco Hudl reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 0 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Tablet Operating system Android (Jelly Bean [4.2]) Screen size 7 inches Storage type Internal storage (16 GB, Flash), Memory card Maximum battery life Up to 9 hours Dimensions 5.07 x 7.59 x 0.39 in Weight 13.05 oz Announced 2013-09-23 see all specs \u2192 There are not any reviews for this product yet.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/25/lenovo-yoga-3-pro-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "November 25th 2014 at 12:00 pm", "body": " I haven't reviewed an Ultrabook in months. It's not because I've grown lazy; it's because there just haven't been many new models to test. Nearly every laptop that crosses Engadget's reviews desk these days is a gaming notebook, a Chromebook or maybe one of those super-cheap netbook things. So here I am, dusting off my Ultrabook-testing skills with the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro, the company's latest flagship laptop. Like every Yoga that's come before it, this new model has a 360-degree hinge that allows it to fold back into tablet mode. It also keeps that stunning 3,200 x 1,800 touchscreen. But that's not what's interesting to me. No, I'm curious about this because it's the first notebook I'm testing with a new Intel Core M chip, which allows the Yoga 3 Pro to be 17 percent thinner than its predecessor, not to mention 15 percent lighter. As a result of moving to a lower-powered chip, the battery life should be better too. Sounds like a recipe for an all-around better Ultrabook, right? Gallery | 37 Photos Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro review + See all 37 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 84 Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro Pros Thin and light, even for an ultraportable Versatile design Generally fast performance Gorgeous display Cons Relatively short battery life Keyboard is shallower than on previous Yoga machines Touchpad could use some fine-tuning Start button on the bezel doesn't always work, but a fix is coming Summary Lenovo's third-generation Yoga laptop is as versatile as ever, except it's noticeably thinner and lighter -- so much so that it's now one of the slimmest Ultrabooks on the market. The battery life has improved too, but it still lags behind the competition, no doubt because that slim design doesn't leave room for a bigger cell.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware If you ask me, Intel's Core M platform was among the most exciting things announced this year. Why? Because they make possible machines like this, a convertible 13-inch laptop that measures just a half-inch thick and weighs 2.62 pounds. That's significantly lighter than the MacBook Air, which comes in at 2.96 pounds and measures 0.68 inch at its thickest point -- and that's without the added weight of a touchscreen. Of course, I should note that we have in fact seen some other super-light systems, and even before Core M arrived on the scene. Sony's discontinued VAIO Pro 13, for instance, came in at 2.34 pounds, while the Acer Aspire S7 measures 0.5 inch thick, the same as the new Yoga. (The S7 is a little heavier, at 2.87 pounds.) Even so, those machines were just regular laptops; they rarely had the sort of versatile design that makes the Yoga and other 2-in-1's so special. The fact that Lenovo could endow the Yoga with a 360-degree hinge and still make it that skinny is, well, an impressive feat indeed. Speaking of the sort, in addition to using a new Core M chip, Lenovo redesigned the Yoga's hinge so that it's now about 2mm thinner than on the previous generation. What we have here is a new \"Watchband\" hinge, to use Lenovo's term, which is comprised of six different points of strength, each of which looks like -- you guessed it -- a link on a wristwatch. The new design adds a little bling, to be sure, but it's also supposedly stronger: The laptop's weight is now distributed across six discrete hinge points, as opposed to just two. Additionally, the new design allows you to lay the notebook flat on a table with both the keyboard and screen facing up. In any case, the hinge still feels sturdy; you can fold the screen back into tablet, \"Tent\" or \"Stand\" mode in one smooth, controlled motion. I also like how the rounded, textured hinge makes it that much easier to grip in one hand. I would caution, though, that the Yoga's palm rest has a little give, which meant I often heard a slight creaking noise when I held the machine in my hands and folded the screen back. A little disconcerting -- no one likes to hear a noise like that -- but I'm also confident it had nothing to do with the hinge mechanism connecting the display to the rest of the system. As a result of the new hinge design, there's no room on the back edge for vents -- or ports, for that matter. In fact, there is a small fan on the backside, but the air comes out of a tiny slit, so thin that you could easily miss it if you didn't know what you were looking for. As for the ports, they're all on the left and right sides, with micro-HDMI output, an SD reader and a USB 3.0 socket on the left. Also on that side is the AC port, which doubles as a USB 2.0 connection -- a nice touch since it means you can use the same AC adapter for your laptop and any other gadget you might be carrying. On the right, meanwhile, you'll find the power key, volume rocker, headphone jack, auto-rotate button and a second USB 3.0 port, new on this year's model. The power button in particular is now farther back than it used to be, so that users won't hit it by accident (for the record, this was never an issue for me). Other than that -- the drastically thinner design and the flashier hinge -- the Yoga 3 Pro follows the same design concept as both Yoga laptops that came before it. Which is to say, the keyboard automatically becomes disabled when you bend the screen back more than 190 degrees. This also means the keys are still exposed on the backside when you're holding the thing in tablet mode, but that's one trade-off of having such a thin machine -- Lenovo's self-flattening keyboard, which it used on its ThinkPad Yoga Ultrabook, requires a much thicker hinge and chassis. Unfortunately, the Start button built into the bezel wasn't always responsive -- a problem our friends at Laptop Mag also experienced. Thankfully, at least, a Lenovo rep told us a software fix is coming before the end of December. The design itself is similar too. This year's model comes in silver and orange (as well as a new gold color), with a metal logo on the lid and a textured, rubbery material covering the palm rest and keyboard deck. Speaking of the keyboard, the backlit buttons have the same \"U\" shape with ample space in between, but there seems to be less travel than on other Lenovo machines, no doubt because of the thinner design. Though I tend to prefer springy keys, the flat ones here are still easy enough to type on. Certainly, they're no worse than other Ultrabooks I've tested; most of those have shallow keyboards too. I've also had decent luck with the touchpad, though there were a few times when I tried to drag the cursor across the screen and it didn't go where I wanted it to. Display and sound One thing that hasn't changed is the display: Even as the Yoga got smaller, Lenovo kept the same 13.3-inch, 3,200 x 1,800 IPS panel. The viewing angles are good, whether you watch from off to the side or dip the screen far forward, as you would in a cramped coach seat. To that end, Lenovo also coated the screen in a low-glare finish that ensures light reflections rarely ever get in the way. Finally, a 72 percent color gamut allows for some punchy, but not overly saturated colors. Annoyingly, certain aspects of the Windows OS and certain websites still look tiny with that high screen resolution, but you can hardly fault Lenovo for that; it's an issue on other super-high-res Windows laptops too. On the audio front, Lenovo moved to a different brand of speakers (JBL) as well as new equalizer software from MaxxAudio to keep everything well-tuned. Unfortunately, I didn't appreciate the sound nearly as much as I thought I would going into this review. For one, the placement of the speakers on the bottom of the machine offsets what would otherwise be some healthy volume. Also, like most every other laptop I've tested, the sound is tinny and distant, and it's obvious with almost every musical genre from jazz to classical to hip-hop. The only time the sound really seemed balanced was when I was listening to music with synthetic elements, tracks like M.I.A.'s \"Paper Planes\" and \"Bubble Bath\" by The Swiss.

The truth is, though, that's only borne out in benchmark tests. Yes, there's a bit of a dip there, especially in graphics tests, but in everyday use, the Yoga 3 Pro felt just as snappy as I'd expect a $1,300 laptop to be. Bootup takes just nine seconds, which is about as fast as you're gonna get on a notebook in this class. The Samsung-made SSD reached top read speeds of 554 MB/s and max writes of 261 MB/s -- a strong showing for a solid-state drive that isn't PCIe-based. And while previous Yoga laptops have received complaints about their WiFi performance, the new 802.11ac radio here maintained a steady, fast connection. Throughout, too, the machine stayed cool -- one obvious benefit of using a lower-powered CPU. Battery life Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro 7:36 MacBook Air (13-inch, 2013) 12:51 MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2013) 11:18 Samsung ATIV Book 9 (2014 Edition) 9:48 Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus 8:44 HP Spectre 13 8:30 Acer Aspire S7-392 7:33 Samsung Series 9 (15-inch, 2012) 7:29 Microsoft Surface Pro 3 7:08 Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro 6:32 Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2014) 6:18 On paper, the Yoga 3 Pro's battery life seems like a step down from its predecessor, mostly because the battery is now smaller: 54Wh vs. 44.8. In fact, though, the runtime is a marked improvement over the last generation. All told, the Yoga 3 Pro held up through seven hours and 36 minutes of continuous video playback; that's about one hour longer than the Yoga 2 Pro lasted. Granted, it pales in comparison to the MacBook Air, which managed nearly 13 hours the last time we benchmarked it, but even so, it's on par with other super-skinny laptops, like the Acer Aspire S7-392. After a certain point, I suppose, you either need to make room for a bigger battery, or settle for slightly shorter runtime. That's a reasonable trade-off, but I also wouldn't want the battery life to be much shorter than this. Software If you pull the trigger on a Yoga laptop, it's probably you because think you'll enjoy using the different modes -- notebook, tablet, Tent, all of that. And Lenovo, as you can imagine, wants to make sure you get the most out of your purchase, especially if you paid more for it than you would another flagship Ultrabook. To that end, Lenovo included an app it calls Yoga Harmony, which suggests different programs to download depending on what mode you're in. So, for example, when I'm using the Yoga 3 Pro as a regular notebook, I'll see mouse-and-keyboard apps like MapQuest, Facebook and Twitch, but when I switch to Stand mode, it'll show me recs for YouTube, Yahoo Weather and Dailymotion -- all things I can use even with the keyboard folded under, against the desk. In addition, the app lists your own favorite apps for each category, which is to say, the programs you've used recently in that mode. Finally, Lenovo shows usage statistics, breaking down how much time you spend in each mode and how that compares to all the other Yoga owners the world over. Neat, I guess, but not a very useful feature. In a similar vein, Lenovo also included Harmony Settings, an app that lives in the system tray on the desktop that automatically adjusts your settings depending on which mode you're using. For example, if you open a photo in laptop mode and then switch to Tent or Stand mode, it'll automatically expand to full-screen, and Lenovo will also turn on motion control, allowing you to page through photos by waving your hand in front of the webcam. Aside from the motion control thing and auto-full-screen feature, Harmony Settings can also do things like adjust the audio and tweak the power-management profile. Be warned that it won't work with every app, but it currently supports nearly 100, including some big-name programs like Microsoft Office, Netflix and Amazon's Kindle reader. Other than that, the Yoga 3 Pro also comes preloaded with Evernote Touch, eBay, the Zinio magazine store, The Weather Channel, Dailymotion, The Telegraph and TripAdvisor, along with Lenovo's own Yoga Chef, Lenovo Photo Master, Lenovo Support, Lenovo Settings and Lenovo Companion apps. It might sound like a lot, but it's just a cluster full of tiles on the Start Screen that you can uninstall if you like. Configuration options and the competition The Yoga 3 Pro comes in two similar configurations, with the only difference being the amount of storage: There's a $1,300 model with a 256GB SSD, and a $1,500 version with 512GB of space. Otherwise, they have the same Core M-5Y70 processor, 8GB of RAM and 3,200 x 1,800 display. Oh, and they both come with a two-year warranty, which is nice; most PC makers include just one year of coverage for consumer machines. As for competing models, well, remember what I said in the second sentence of this review: that there haven't been many new models. Many of the machines I'm going to list here have been around for quite a while, though most of them at least use newer Intel processors. If you insist on a shape-shifting 2-in-1 like the Yoga, Dell's excellent XPS 12 Ultrabook is still kicking, two years after it first came out. Starting at $1,100, it's cheaper than the Yoga 3 Pro, but it's also heavier, at 3.35 pounds. On the plus side, though, you get a cushier keyboard, an attractive design and longer battery life -- up to eight hours, according to Dell. Alternatively, if you'd rather have a tablet with a detachable keyboard, Microsoft's 12-inch Surface Pro 3 has all the power and longevity of an Ultrabook, squeezed into a 1.76-pound device. At $799, it's also cheaper than a flagship laptop, but keep in mind that this price doesn't include a keyboard (Microsoft's thin \"Type Cover\" sells separately for $130). Otherwise, you'll find that many new 2-in-1 devices don't have the power to match a traditional Ultrabook; if anything, they have more in common with tablets. That leaves a lot of regular clamshell laptops -- not a bad choice by any means, but they're definitely not as versatile as the Yoga. If you're going to go this route, you might want to check out the ASUS Zenbook UX301LA (around $1,800 and up), which has a 2,560 x 1,440 screen option and a sleek design. Keep in mind, though, that at 3.08 pounds, it's one of the heavier options here. There's also the Acer Aspire S7-392 ($1,400-plus), which I mentioned earlier: It's nearly as thin and light as the Yoga 3 Pro, with similarly long battery life and a 2,560 x 1,440 screen that offers great colors and viewing angles. Samsung's 13-inch ATIV Book 9 Plus ($1,400-plus) is also a strong choice, with its premium design, long battery life and stunning 3,200 x 1,800 display. There's also the 13-inch Toshiba Kirabook, which starts at $1,500 with a 2,560 x 1,440 display, but in our review we criticized it for its viewing angles and loud fan. Lastly, no discussion of thin and light laptops would be complete without the MacBook Air, which now starts at $999 for the 13-inch model and is rated for up to 12 hours of runtime. Keep in mind, though, that the Air's screen is painfully low-res compared to all these other machines, and it lacks a touchscreen (not that OS X was designed to be used with the fingers anyway). Wrap-up There's something to be said for a 2.6-pound laptop. It's sexy; it's that much easier to carry around; and, uh, did I mention it's sexy? On a serious note, though, I hope that over time, super-light laptops like this come with fewer trade-offs. As it stands, the Yoga remains the most versatile Ultrabook on the market, with a sturdy 360-degree hinge, brilliant screen and zippy performance. But the battery life is short compared to competing (read: slightly heavier) models. Also, because of that skinny design, Lenovo had to say goodbye to its trademark cushy keyboard and settle for something shallower -- something less comfortable to type on. All things considered, I still recommend the Yoga 3 Pro; it has enough going for it that it could be worth the $1,300 asking price. But it's no slam dunk either. Shoppers must consider how much battery life is enough, and how flat a keyboard they can tolerate. As for Intel and PC makers like Lenovo, I'd warn that there is such a thing as too thin. The Yoga 3 has good enough battery life, and good enough performance and a good enough keyboard, but if the laptop were any skinnier, we might have a problem. Getting to handle a half-inch thin notebook is fun, but I'm not sure I want notebooks of the future to be much thinner -- at least, not until the PC industry can figure out how to pull it off without further compromises. And you know what: I bet the mad scientists in Intel's laboratory are already working on just that. Until they come up with something, though, you can probably survive with seven-hour battery life -- or, you know, a three-pound laptop. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: core m, corem, intel core m, intelcorem, lenovo, lenovo yoga 3 pro, lenovoyoga3pro, review, uk-reviews, ultrabook, video, yoga 3 pro, yoga3pro \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20996354 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20996354\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lenovo/yoga/3-pro/\"> Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro </a> Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro 80HE000LUS 80HE000HUS Buy from $1159 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lenovo/yoga/3-pro/\" title=\"Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 2 </a> Prices Discussions Type Tablet Form factor Convertible Screen resolution 3200 x 1800 Bundled OS Windows (8.1) CPU family Other Processor speed 1.1 GHz System RAM 8 GB Announced 2014-10-09 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Speed and features 9 Design and form factor 10 Battery life 8 Display 9 Durability 10 Expandability 8 Noise 9 Portability (size / weight) 8 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 Displaying prices for model: 80HE000LUS-Black 80HE000HUS-Black $1144.00 + tax & shipping Buy now No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

That includes chip makers too, like NVIDIA. Though the company previously shied away from Chrome OS devices, it's now pledging to power a whole range of different Chromebooks with its Tegra K1 chip, each of them promising long battery life and more graphics muscle. The Acer Chromebook 13 is the first of the bunch, and while some of you might be Chromebook'd out, we were actually excited. Here was a $300 laptop boasting at least 11 hours of battery life, a 1080p display option and enough horsepower to clobber Intel at things like gaming and rich websites. As it turns out, it was all just a little too good to be true. Gallery | 25 Photos Acer Chromebook 13 review + See all 25 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 80 Acer Chromebook 13 Pros One of the few Chromebooks with a 1080p screen Long battery life Runs quietly, stays cool Comfortable keyboard and trackpad Competitive price Cons Performance not as strong as promised Limited viewing angles Build quality feels cheap next to some rival devices Heavy compared to some competing models Summary As the first Chrome OS device with an NVIDIA Tegra chip, the Acer Chromebook 13 isn't as powerful as promised. Still, it manages to redeem itself with long battery life, a sharp screen, a comfortable keyboard and, most importantly, a fair price. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Looking at the Chromebook 13's spec sheet, you'd assume design was the main place where Acer cut corners. And you wouldn't exactly be wrong. The machine is fashioned entirely out of plastic, with certain parts, like the bezels and bottom side, actually feeling a bit rough to the touch. Next to the Samsung Chromebook 2, which sports a fake-leather lid, this is clearly the cheaper of the two. Acer's model is also about a quarter-pound heavier, at 3.31 pounds and 0.71 inch thick, versus 3.06 pounds/0.65 inch for the Chromebook 2. If you want something as light as a 13-inch Ultrabook, you better be prepared to pay an extra $100 for the Samsung. Still, compared to Acer's older Chromebook, the C720, this is a marked improvement. Whereas the 11-inch C720 is small and cramped, like a netbook, this 13-incher is broader, with a more spacious keyboard and a wide touchpad to match. The design is simpler, too. Yes, it's plastic, but the all-white look is at least clean and modern-looking. Also, not that the lid and palm rest pick up scratches easily, but if they did, they'd be all but invisible thanks to the white paint job. Even if Acer's design here is on the plain side, it's all worth it when you see the display. For all the scaling-back Acer did with the rest of the chassis, the screen here is quite nice for a Chromebook, especially one this size. What we have here is a bright, 1,920 x 1,080 display with a matte finish that allows for some relatively wide viewing angles, especially from the sides. Even so, there's only so much you can dip the lid forward before the panel starts to wash out. This, I'm afraid, is a problem across all Chromebooks -- even on models with sharper, 1080p screens, I've yet to see one with truly good viewing angles. Chalk it up to PC makers trying to keep hardware costs down, I guess. As I hinted earlier, the keyboard here is nice and big -- a perk of choosing a 13-inch Chromebook over an 11-inch one. That means all of the major keys (Shift, etc.) are amply sized and easy to strike without looking. That said, the keys don't seem to have much more travel than they did on the C720, which means I once again found myself having to re-type things after my key presses didn't register the first time. Even so, I found it usable, and I think you will too. On a brighter note, the touchpad is nice and big, and responds well to both single-finger tracking as well as multi-touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom. Around the edges, the Chromebook 13 has all the same ports as competing devices, which is to say it sports two USB ports, an HDMI socket, a full-sized SD card slot and a headphone jack. You might not know it at first glance, though: Whereas most machines stack all the ports along the right and left sides, the Chromebook 13 has a USB and HDMI port tucked around on the back, out of sight. So, it might seem at first like Acer was stingy -- that it could only be bothered to include one USB port, a memory card slot and an audio port. But that's just the extent of what you can see when the machine is in front of you.

To recap what I said in the very first paragraph of this review, the Acer Chromebook 13 is the first Chrome OS device to make use of an NVIDIA Tegra chip -- specifically, the quad-core K1 processor already used in some tablets. To hear NVIDIA tell it, the chip is better than Intel's Bay Trail processors (the ones inside most Chromebooks) in every way possible. That's not quite true. In single-thread JavaScript tests like SunSpider, Mozilla Kraken and Google Octane, the Chromebook 13 performs in line, if not slightly worse than, Bay Trail Chromebooks like the Lenovo N20p. In daily use, it cold-boots in nine seconds and can sign off in about four -- not bad for a Chromebook, but not exceptional, either. NVIDIA, for its part, doesn't deny the less-than-impressive JavaScript results, though it's quick to suggest some WebGL tests instead that are more likely to showcase Tegra's graphics muscle. Indeed, in an animated Gangnam Style video (don't ask), Acer Chromebook 13 runs between 50 and 60 fps, while the Lenovo N20p's Bay Trail processor could barely crack 24 fps. (I used Google Chrome's built-in frame-rate counter.) In the benchmark Oort Online, the Chromebook 13 scored an average of 4,007, compared with 1,300 for the N20p. In this 3D Earth model, Acer peaked in the high 50s, with frame rates mostly hovering in the 30s and 40s; with the N20p, frame rates stayed in the 20s and 30s, depending on how fast I spun the globe around. Finally, in NVIDIA's own multitasking test, which involves running a Google Sheets macro with music streaming in a different tab, I saw a 21 percent improvement in speed on the Acer Chromebook 13: 46 seconds, down from 58 on the Lenovo N20p. This would be a good time for me to back up and put all that in plain English. What it comes down to is this: The Acer Chromebook 13 does well on some tests, particularly the ones that NVIDIA itself recommends. Otherwise, its performance falls in line with the very Bay Trail-powered machines that NVIDIA claims to beat. Either way, the Chromebook 13 doesn't feel faster than other Chrome OS devices in real-world use. It doesn't feel slower either, but that's not saying much, given that Chromebooks generally aren't known for their stellar performance. On the plus side, the machine stays nice and quiet, and it runs cool. Ultimately, if you buy the Chromebook 13, it should be because of the price, the 1080p screen, the long battery life -- not because you're expecting superior computing power. Battery life Acer Chromebook 13 10:07 ASUS C200 11:19 Dell Chromebook 11 8:37 Samsung Chromebook 2 (13-inch) 8:22 Toshiba Chromebook 8:15 Acer C720 Chromebook (Intel Core i3) 7:53 Acer C720 Chromebook (Intel Celeron) 7:49 Samsung Chromebook (2012) 6:33 HP Chromebook 11 5:08 Chromebook Pixel 4:08 (WiFi)/3:34 (LTE) HP Pavilion 14 Chromebook 3:35 Samsung Chromebook Series 5 550 3:23 Acer C7 Chromebook 3:16 NVIDIA's performance claims may have fallen short, but the battery life here is just about as long as promised. On the 1080p model, which is rated for up to 11 hours, we got 10 hours and seven minutes of continuous video playback. That's admittedly a grueling test, too, so I have no doubt that with a lighter workload and more conservative brightness settings, the machine could've made it to the 11-hour mark and then some. If you go with the lower-end Chromebook 13, which has a 1,366 x 768 display, you can expect up to 13 hours of runtime, according to Acer. I unfortunately didn't get to benchmark one of those, so I can't vouch for that particular performance claim. If it's true, though, that would make it the longest-lasting Chromebook on the market. Software Though we've been reviewing quite a few Chromebooks over the past few months, the software experience hasn't changed much in that time. If you're just tuning in, though, here's a quick primer on what to expect. Chrome OS has slowly gotten better at letting you do things offline -- users have long been able to use Gmail and Google Drive without an internet connection. Recently, too, Google made it so that you can watch Google Play movies and TV shows offline -- a useful feature if ever you find yourself on a long plane ride. Other recent improvements include pinch-to-zoom, better file management and the ability to upload photos to Google+ in the background. Speaking of G+, the Acer Chromebook 13 comes with 100GB of free Google Drive storage -- a standard perk for Chromebook users. Configuration options and the competition The Chromebook 13 starts at $280 and is available in four configurations. The lowest-end edition has a 1,366 x 768 display, 2GB of RAM and a 13-hour battery. Step up to the $300 mark, and you actually have two options at that price: a 1080p screen with 2GB of RAM, or a 1,366 x 768 display with 4GB of RAM. If you want it all -- a full HD screen with four gigs of memory -- you can have it, for $380. Oh, and by the way, in case you're wondering, almost all of these configurations have 16GB of built-in storage (the high-end one has 32GB). As for everything else on the market, well, I'm not really helping you if I list off every single option. But I can recommend a few notables. First of all, if you're looking for something on par with the Chromebook 13, its most obvious competitor would be the 13-inch Samsung Chromebook 2, which also has an ARM-based chip and a 1080p display. With its sharp screen, comfortable keyboard and relatively premium-looking design, it still ranks as one of my favorites. The problem is that it costs $400, which is getting into \"cheap Windows laptop\" territory. And at that price, the performance isn't quite as robust as some competing models. If, like me, you think even an ARM chip is good enough for basic tasks, you might actually like the Acer Chromebook 13 I've been reviewing here: It offers similar performance, with an equally sharp screen, except it costs $100 less. It's not quite as polished-looking, but again, it's not ugly, either. Soon enough, though, Samsung and Acer won't be the only ones selling full HD Chromebooks. Toshiba, for one, is about to ship its own Chromebook 2, which will start at $250 ($330 if you want the 1080p resolution). That will include an Intel Bay Trail chip, which means performance is likely to be slightly better than Acer's or Samsung's offerings, but battery life could be shorter (or not -- we'll see). It looks promising, but I haven't tested this one, so I unfortunately can't confirm how well it performs. If performance is a concern -- meaning, you're worried an ARM chip won't cut it -- all roads lead back to Acer. The company's C720 Chromebook is one of our favorites. For one thing, it's among the only ones offered with a Core i3 chip, which delivers noticeable (albeit fairly modest) performance gains. At the same time, it's one of the best-value machines we've seen: For $199, you can get it with an Intel Haswell-series Celeron CPU that still delivers decent performance. The only thing to keep in mind with either model is that the battery life will be several hours shorter than on the Chromebook 13. So, it depends a lot on what your priorities are: maximum performance or top-notch battery life? Acer earns both of those honors -- just not with the same machine, unfortunately. What about Windows machines? Finally, you might be wondering what kind of Windows PCs you'll find at this price -- $300 is technically \"cheap Windows laptop\" territory, too. By and large, the machines you'll find at this price will have larger, 15-inch screens with either an Intel Celeron processor or an AMD E-series chip. In other words, the performance should be on par with many similarly priced Chromebooks. That said, there are a few systems at this price that are just as small and portable as the Acer Chromebook 13, if not more so. These include the 11-inch Lenovo S215 ($349), the 11-inch Acer Aspire ES1 ($250-plus) and the HP Pavilion 10z Touch ($250). For the money, you get a 1,366 x 768 screen and around 500GB of built-in storage. In a similar vein, HP is about to start shipping the first laptop from its \"Stream\" series, which aims to take on Chromebooks in the form of a cheap notebook that runs Windows, but has very little local storage. The first model is a 14-incher priced at $300. This, too, has a 1,366 x 768 display and makes use of an AMD chip. I'm not saying I recommend it, especially for three hundred bucks, but it could be tempting for someone who wants a budget machine that can still run desktop Windows apps. Wrap-up The Chromebook 13 isn't everything Acer and NVIDIA promised it would be, but somehow, it's still a worthwhile product. Though its performance isn't much better than the Intel Bay Trail machines it claims to beat, the battery life is nearly best in class, reaching 10 hours even with a full HD screen. Speaking of the sort, this remains one of the few Chromebooks out there with screen resolution greater than 1,366 x 768. Yes, the viewing angles could be better, but then again, that's true of every Chrome OS laptop, so it's hard to really fault Acer for that. Most importantly, though, with a price starting at $280 (or $300 for the full HD version), it's easy to forgive many of the machine's flaws. Even with merely average performance, this feels like a fair price for what it is: a Chromebook with a sharp screen, long battery life and a spacious, comfortable keyboard. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: acer, acer chromebook 13, acerchromebook13, chrome os, chromebook, chromebook 13, chromebook13, chromebooks, chromeos, nvidia, nvidia tegra, nvidiategra, review, tegra, tegra k1, tegrak1, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20959099 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20959099\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/acer/chromebook/13/\"> Acer Chromebook 13 </a> Acer Chromebook 13 CB5-311-T7NN CB5-311-T9B0 CB5-311-T1UU Buy from $219 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/acer/chromebook/13/\" title=\"Acer Chromebook 13 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 3 </a> Prices Discussions Type Ultraportable Screen size 13.3 inches Screen resolution 1366 x 768 Bundled OS Linux (Chrome OS) System RAM 2 GB Maximum battery life Up to 13 hours Weight 3.31 lb Announced 2014-08-11 see all specs \u2192 6.7average user rating Speed and features 8 Design and form factor 8.7 Battery life 10 Display 4.7 Durability 8 Expandability 6 Noise 10 Portability (size / weight) 9.3 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 Displaying prices for model: CB5-311-T7NN-White CB5-311-T1UU-White $219.99 + tax & shipping Buy now 1 Acer Chromebook 13 vs Toshiba Chromebook 2?

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2015/02/10/blackberry-classic-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "February 10th 2015 at 3:00 pm", "body": " Let's put Apple, Samsung and all their ilk aside for few moments: It really wasn't that long ago that a homegrown Canadian company called BlackBerry (well, RIM at the time) basically ruled the mobile world. The outfit's slow decline has been chronicled, opined upon for years, and yet, some of BlackBerry's most ardent fans still clamor for the days when QWERTY keyboards and teensy trackpads were uber-efficient status symbols instead of the relics they are now. Enter the BlackBerry Classic. The name says it all, really: It's a paean to BlackBerry's halcyon days, and it's got a look plucked straight out of 2011, to boot. We took one for an extended spin to see how BlackBerry's throwback formula holds up today, and (very long story short) it's mostly the past mashed up with a touch of the modern. The bigger question, as usual, is whether or not it's worth your time. I suspect you already know the answer, but read on for my full impressions. Gallery | 21 Photos BlackBerry Classic review + See all 21 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 68 BlackBerry Classic Pros Its physical QWERTY keyboard is still aces Lots of good software touches BlackBerry holdouts will love the throwback design Cons Finding (and installing)\u00a0apps can be tiresome Hit-or-miss performance Can't remove the battery Mediocre camera Summary The BlackBerry Classic hearkens back to the good old days, when a solid QWERTY keyboard and a dense design turned phones into full-blown business partners. Alas, with inconsistent performance and an app ecosystem that takes plenty of getting used to, the Classic is still best suited for absolute die-hard productivity hounds and long-standing BlackBerry devotees. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Historically, BlackBerry has been uneven when it came to build quality: For every tank the company put out, there was one that was unsatisfyingly light. Even the venerable Curves and Pearls of yore skewed toward the lighter, plasticky end of the spectrum. Not so here. The Classic is dense and solidly constructed, as if to declare -- loudly -- that it's more of a tool than a toy. One thing the Classic doesn't share with its old-school comrades is the ability to pop off the rear cover for a foolproof restart or a handy battery swap. No, its dimpled back plate is affixed to the chassis, so all you'll be able to do with it is finger the chrome BlackBerry logo and gaze at the 8-megapixel camera and LED flash running across the top of the Classic's backside. Itching to pop in a SIM or a microSD card? Hope you've got a paper clip handy; you'll need one to access the pair of trays along the phone's left side. On the opposite edge, there's a pair of volume buttons separated by a key dedicated to launching the digital assistant (more on that later). And the front? It's just the sort of blast from the past I expected here. It's even got a notification light to pulse at you whenever an email lands in your inbox to complete the historic look. Rounding out the facade is a 2-megapixel fixed-focus camera lodged above the 3.5-inch square 720p screen. Below all that lies the affectionately named \"tool belt,\" bringing along dedicated Call, End, Menu and Back buttons... and a trackpad. It's been years since I've seen an optical trackpad on a smartphone, let alone used one in lieu of a touchscreen to get stuff done. And you know what? I didn't miss them at all, or so I thought. After a few days, my tune started to change, if only a little. In case it wasn't apparent, the Classic's tiny black nub helps you ably home in on teensy links and subtly nudge the cursor between letters so you can polish off that witty Twitter retort. For such minute operations, the trackpad is just lovely. You can use it for grander gestures too, like scrolling through a story, but in those cases it never feels quite as comfortable swiping a thumb down a glass touchscreen (Gorilla Glass 3, in this case). If anything, it almost makes more sense as a supplement to a touchscreen than a means of navigation unto itself. The rest of the tool belt is as straightforward as it is functional, with only the Menu button coming off like a relic. BlackBerry has spent more than two years refining the way BB10 works with a touchscreen, adding gestures that feel natural and replace the Menu key almost entirely. And then there's the keyboard. I've always been fond of retro devices like the BlackBerry Tour 9630, a phone whose tiny QWERTY keys got me through at least one college paper dissecting some long-dead poets and a failed relationship or two. The Classic has a pretty standard four-row affair, with all your letters, numbers and punctuation crammed into the top three rows leaving the space bar and Symbol keys (remember those?) all by themselves. If you've never picked up a BlackBerry before, the size and density of these keys will take some time to get used to; it took three or four days before muscle memory kicked in and I could peck out messages with something approaching the fury I used to have. And after that? I wouldn't quite call it typing nirvana, but there's a comforting amount of travel and a satisfying click to those keys. Welcome home, BlackBerry fans. It would've been nice if the company had transplanted some of that sweet, sweet gesture-tracking tech we saw in the Passport into the Classic, but \"newfangled\" isn't the name of the game here. Display and sound Beyond the obvious Huey Lewis joke, there isn't a lot to be said about the Classic's 3.5-inch square screen; it's bright enough to use in direct sunlight, and colors are plenty vivid, too. BlackBerry was kind enough to let you tweak the screen's white balance right from the settings, something that just about every other smartphone maker out there is loath to do. Is it going to do much good for anyone who isn't seriously finicky? Maybe not, but I couldn't help but dial down the default warmth level a touch anyway. It's certainly not the most pixel-dense screen you'll encounter, which is slightly tragic since the Passport squeezes four times as many active pixels into a screen that's only an inch bigger diagonally. Once again, we've got BlackBerry's business-friendly mantra to thank here; small as the display is, there's still enough space to get you thumbing through emails and tweets without too many complaints. Speaking of the sort, yes, I've got a few. A square display doesn't sound all that obtuse in theory, but the reality can be rougher than you might think. The lack of vertical screen space means that your thumb will get more of a workout because of the additional scrolling needed to plow through an article. The kicker: Just about every video you watch on your phone will be flanked by some serious letterboxing thanks to the aspect ratio mismatch. You'll usually find way more empty space surrounding a video than there is video itself, but that's fine -- the lackluster speaker lodged on the Classic's bottom helps ensure you won't want to watch for long anyway. There's a noticeable hollowness -- a lack of depth -- to the sound issuing forth from the driver, which I guess is in keeping with the Classic's predilection for serious business. (Don't be fooled by the other speaker-like grille on the other side of the micro-USB port; that's the microphone.) You'll want to plug in some headphones to get the full experience -- such that it is -- but avoid the ones that come in the box. When I tear into the packaging of a new phone, those pack-ins are usually the first things that get tossed in the junk drawer and these earbuds were destined for the same fate. They're a comfortable pair, even surprisingly so, but they sound pretty lousy. Grab a $10 pair from your local big-box store -- trust me. You'll be a lot happier. Software We did a deep dive on BlackBerry 10.3 when we played with the Passport last year, so I won't dwell too much on the nitty-gritty. Suffice to say, the platform has come a long way since those early days. The version loaded on the Classic (10.3.1, to be precise) looks a little flatter and feels more polished than builds we've futzed with in the past. Let's start from the top. The BlackBerry Hub (a slide-out panel that offers tantalizingly quick access to all of your messages) continues to be the best part of the BB10 experience. No matter where you are, no matter what app you've got running, that unified inbox is just a swipe away. For FOMO-prone types like me, it's a godsend. BB10 also sports what's probably my favorite visual multitasking metaphor since the days of webOS cards, and now you can dismiss each of those apps (up to eight of those active frames are visible at any one time) with a click of the Back button when they're highlighted. New to this build is the ability to run apps in the background without an active frame, which can be jarring the first few times; I apparently granted Rdio background access and it took me time to figure out how to kill it. Those two features in tandem speak to just how seriously BlackBerry takes its beloved productivity angle, and it doesn't stop there. I won't lie: I bristled at the idea of loading up my full-to-the-brim work computer with yet another mostly pointless smartphone-management app, but BlackBerry Blend is probably the best-executed of the lot. Setup took all of a few moments once I remembered my BlackBerry account details, and marking emails as read and adding calendar entries reflected immediately on the Classic. Good stuff. Even some of BB10's me-too features impressed, like BlackBerry's virtual assistant (which also doubles as the Search interface whenever you start typing something while on the home screen). Thing is, invoking it by holding a button on the side of the phone was strangely inconsistent; it'd work just fine about 95 percent of the time, but I've spent more time scratching my head wondering about the other 5 percent than I care to. It's a silly little error, and one that needs fixing. Once you've roused it, though, your phone-bound concierge is plenty smart. I needed to dig up a scheduling email from my boss sent weeks ago, and just couldn't be bothered to do all the swiping and typing required. Instead, I asked my assistant if I had \"any messages about news from Terrence,\" and a moment later, it surfaced exactly what I was looking for. It didn't take long for me to use the BlackBerry Assistant for other things I could've easily done by hand. Turning off Bluetooth and turning on WiFi? Launching apps? Checking in on Foursquare? All easily handled by talking at a phone. After a while, it became less about the utility of the thing and more about seeing how awkward I could get before it stopped recognizing my words. (I gave up when the assistant correctly rendered and interpreted \"What type of Pok\u00e9mon is Charizard?\" with Wolfram Alpha's help.) If the assistant dismissed itself and let me pick up where I left off, I'd like it even more. And now it's time we acknowledge the hulking mammoth in the room: There's still a noticeable dearth of apps for BlackBerry 10. CEO John Chen knows just how dire the problem is. In an open letter meant to tap into a larger conversation about net neutrality, he basically asked developers of big-name apps to bring their wares to BlackBerry 10 because, well, it's only fair right? Sorry, John. It's a shitty, vicious circle, but that's just not how it works and the end result is an app landscape that still feels barren even after two years. Let's consider some of the big names, shall we? I don't post much on Facebook and Twitter, but I'm a sucker for sharing photos on Instagram. Those first two social networks are well represented by a pair of native apps, but you'll have to turn to third-party offerings to get your filtered-food-photos fix. Productivity and communications tools like HipChat, Yammer, Convo and Slack don't exist in BlackBerry World either, and that's a shame considering the Classic's business-friendly ethos. Those omissions alone mean this thing wouldn't fly as a work tool here at Engadget, nor in any of my other post-college jobs. When it comes to media, there's Pandora, but no Rdio or Spotify apps. That said, you can find versions of the latter two in Amazon's Android app store. If you're looking for something really specific, you'll have to get your hands on the Android .APK and sideload it onto your Classic. Thankfully, that's gotten easier over the past few months; with a little patience and some elbow grease, you can get a mostly working version of the Google Play Store running on BlackBerry 10 devices. Camera Summing up BlackBerry's classic device philosophy is pretty simple: They're great for business and lousy as cameras. Sad to say, but history really does repeat itself; neither the 8-megapixel rear shooter nor the 2-megapixel selfie camera is worth writing home about. Out of the box, the Classic was set to shoot photos with a 1:1 aspect ratio, which is great for Instagram and the square screen, but less so for viewing images on other displays. A quick pop into the Settings will fix that right up; from there you can choose 4:3, 16:9 or a new panorama mode. BlackBerry's promo materials insist that the Classic's camera is snappy, and you know what? It is -- when it wants to be. With the sun overhead or bright lights nearby, you can hardly tell you've snapped a photo at all -- it's that fast. (There's also something satisfying about using the space bar to snap a shot, but I digress.) Thing is, the camera does an about-face in dim conditions where you need to use the flash. I've spent too much time after pressing the shutter button wondering if it worked -- only to move my hand inadvertently, and then I realize I've just ruined a picture in progress. Even under otherwise decent conditions, letting the camera autofocus can take a while, and even then it has trouble locking on stuff in the foreground. Unless you drag the focus reticle around yourself, expect your fair share of soft photos. Gallery | 14 Photos BlackBerry Classic sample shots + See all 14 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") On the upside, images are reasonably detailed and pretty well-saturated. A semiautomatic HDR mode helps fill in the gaps, though; whenever you point the camera at a brightly lit scene, a notification drops down from the top asking if wouldn't rather HDR-ize whatever you're looking at. Honestly, you might as well just use it full-time. Naturally, the Classic shoots 720p or 1080p video in a pinch with mostly pleasing results: Colors aren't oversaturated and the resulting footage is lacking in crispness, but it's enough to capture the kids flinging their first spoonfuls of macaroni. Oh, and be sure to lock your phone before you slip it back in your pants. I was puzzled to discover a slew of seafoam green images and pitch-black videos in my camera roll, and I can only surmise they were snapped from inside my pocket. Silly me: I'd forgotten how finicky physical buttons and tight denim can be. Performance and battery life BlackBerry didn't bother throwing in the same top-tier parts here as it did in the square-shaped Passport. In fact, BlackBerry apparently wanted to complete the throwback formula by choosing a chip that's been around for ages: a 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 Plus, paired with 2GB of RAM. That might sound like a nail in the Classic's coffin, but the reality isn't nearly that grim. The process of actually navigating the Classic -- thumbing down web pages, swiping between home screens and sifting through messages in your Hub -- is all pretty painless. Then again, BlackBerry has almost always nailed this sort of bread-and-butter functionality, so it's really no surprise that the Classic handles all that with aplomb. (This is the point in the review where I'd normally drop in a pretty little table of benchmarks, but that would've been an exercise in futility -- a slew of Android benchmarking apps might have run on the thing, but there's no way they were going to tell us the full story.) With all that said, there's still a lingering sense of slowness that can be hard to ignore sometimes. And those sideloaded Android apps? They can be rock-solid when they feel like it, but more often than not you'll tap one to launch and wait... and wait... before it finally springs to life. Oh, but wait: Your ordeal isn't over yet. There's also the question of how well the app will even run. Rdio, for instance, moved with all the urgency of a glacier, which would almost be tolerable if it could consistently play music worth a damn. Longish startup times aren't even exclusive to apps you've downloaded yourself, either. I stared at a black screen for seven or eight seconds waiting for something as mundane as the Reminders app to get its act together, and five-second lulls were common when firing up still other first-party apps. These constant, seemingly minor delays are an ever-present reminder that what I had in my hands wasn't even pretending to be a flagship. They're the price you pay to own a piece of nostalgia incarnate. At least you won't be left wanting more juice. The non-removable 2,515mAh battery will easily get you through a full day plus a bit of downtime at home before needing a top-up. Thanks to a battery-saving mode baked into BB 10.3.1, I managed to get the phone to last until noon the next day, but even so, the brightness and performance trade-offs can be a bitter pill to swallow. Thankfully, you can determine when those power-saving measures kick in, and even if you want them to at all. Here's what really gets me, though: Sticking around for a full day of work is table stakes for a BlackBerry, and the Q10 hangs in there just about as long as the Classic does with a removable battery. While it would've been nice to see the company give us the option of swapping cells, the battery is really the least of the Classic's issues. The competition Let's face it: If you're even considering this thing, it's because you feel that deep, urgent sense of longing for everything BlackBerry stands for. If that's the case, you may want to consider the Passport instead: Its innards are in line with plenty of other top-tier smartphones on the market, and that curious touch-sensitive keyboard is all sorts of lovely once you get used to it. Throw in a bigger, more pixel-packed screen and you've got yourself a real BlackBerry flagship... even if it did make us all scratch our heads when we first saw it. Both the Classic and the Passport (or at least, a less pointy version of it) will be available on AT&T at some point, but there's still no firm word on when. For now, if you're a BlackBerry buff in the US and you need to replace your aging Bold, buying these things unlocked at full price is the only way to go. On the off chance your BlackBerry allegiance is starting to waver, you could also cut out the software middleman and go straight for an Android device. Bear in mind, the Classic costs $449 unlocked -- assuming you could wait until Tuesday rolls around, a 64GB OnePlus One could be yours for a full $100 less. Yes, you lose the thrill of pecking on a physical QWERTY keyboard, but you'll get a better screen, a better camera and Android apps that run the way they're supposed to. If you're considering signing an agreement with AT&T to get the Classic, you could also nab a contract-free LG G3, a device we mostly loved that'll cost you about $30 more than an unlocked Classic. Neither of these choices will really sate your desire for a BlackBerry, but they will be worthy pocket companions. And hey, if you ever long for the company of your BlackBerry-toting friends, the BBM app is just a few taps away in the Google Play Store. Wrap-up Saying that the BlackBerry Classic isn't for everyone is like pointing out that snow is really quite chilly and oxygen is a lovely thing to breathe. It's so obvious that it barely means anything at all. What the Classic is, though, is a mostly reliable device, so long as you're willing to put up with its many, many quirks. I toted the thing through the thrumming hellscape that is the CES show floor, and I was grateful for its comfortable keyboard and its constant flow of easily glanceable messages. But did I feel so much as a pang of regret or longing when it came time to put the Classic back in its box? Take a wild guess. Everything I needed to get my job done and beyond (even with stringent corporate IT policies in place) was available -- and ran better -- on my iPhone and Android devices. In the end, the Classic is a device with its heart in the right place, but a head stuck in the past. Unless you've been on this roller-coaster ride since the good old days, or you're a sucker for a good underdog story, leave this thing on the shelf. The rest of the world has moved on, and you probably have too. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: blackberry, mobilepostcross, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21139600 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21139600\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); lab.scriptBs('gravity.js') onBreak({ 0: function(){}, 320: function(){}, 768: function(){} }); ", "title": "BlackBerry Classic review: A love letter to fans and few others"},
{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/29/nintendo-3ds-review-new-3ds/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "October 29th 2014 at 12:00 pm", "body": " Nintendo's original 3D handheld launched in 2011 and three years is a seriously long time in tech -- especially for Nintendo. Fortunately, it's been a hit -- over 44 million units sold so far -- following a tradition of handheld console leadership that started way back with the original Game Boy. (And if you've seen Nintendo's recent depressing earnings reports, you know that handhelds are why Mario is still able to even make ends meet.) So here's not one, but two hardware refreshes. Yep, two models, one bigger than the other (sound familiar?), both of which arrive with new buttons, a second (gasp!) analog stick and some new 3D screen assistance that means I now willingly switch on the 3D effect while playing games. Whoa. For now, it's launched in Japan and parts of Asia, and it's also coming soon to Australia and New Zealand. I'd bet the cost of a new 3DS that it'll make its way to the rest of the world at some point; it's just a matter of when. This is the New 3DS and New 3DS LL, and if you already have an older model, you'll probably want to consider an upgrade. Gallery | 22 Photos New Nintendo 3DS review + See all 22 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 85 Nintendo 3DS (2014) Pros 3D screen works better, is more enjoyable to use Secondary analog pad offers richer control options Upgraded processor does everything faster Cons Some games work differently on the last-gen 3DSes Customizable plates only offered on the smaller New 3DS Buying games and apps is still a chore Summary Both of the new 3DSes bring enough improvements to warrant an upgrade from the original system. Nintendo has finally managed to make the 3D effect work comfortably, and hardware looks more refined on both models. If you already own a 3DS, an upgrade in 2015 is a wise decision. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") The controls Both of the handhelds have new buttons and new controls, and they're all changes for the better. Nintendo's added secondary trigger keys (ZL and ZR, respectively), both of which lie on the inside edge of the primary L and R trigger buttons. The new triggers are about half the size, but they should open up more sophisticated control settings for games, if makers are willing to configure for the two new consoles. (Ah, there's that caveat.) The start and select buttons on the 3DSes are now underneath the colored action buttons, with a single Home button underneath the secondary touchscreen display. It looks classier and more streamlined than the row of relatively chintzy-looking buttons (Home, Select and Start) on the original 3DS XL. Importantly, then, there's that new analog nub. I'm not going to call it an analog stick, because it's most certainly a nub, inspired by the yellow-hued protrusion found on the GameCube's controller (RIP), but it's not quite as handy. I'm not completely sold on its ability to do anything dynamic (say in Smash Bros., where you can unleash those all-important knockouts), but it does work. Better still, it's a more than capable camera control in (compatible!) games like Monster Hunter 4G and should, importantly, take the weight off assigning excessively fiddly button combinations to offer similar functions. Nintendo appears to be trying to ensure it's compatible with any game that's used that peripheral curio, the Circle Pad Pro, although that doesn't quite work the other way around. The aforementioned Nintendo beat-em-up isn't compatible with the Circle Pad Pro, so if you want a second stick, you're gonna have to pay up for one of these new 3DSes. The screen For me, it's the changes Nintendo has made to the 3D screen (or at least how it works) that make these new consoles a substantial improvement over their predecessors. In case you've forgotten (or you keep the 3D mode turned off like I typically did), there was only a very narrow sweet spot for playing games in pop-up 3D. Tilt your head a little, lean back too far or (heaven forbid) try some gyroscopic controls and it disappears, the Magic Eye effect broken. This time, Nintendo's new \"super-stable 3D\" monitors where your head is (there's even a twee little animated head when you first set up the function that tracks your movement). Nintendo added an infrared LED, nestled next to the front-facing camera, to help track in less than ideal lighting. Thanks to this, there's no longer any weird, flickering double image -- at least it's a rare occurrence when playing. All told, there's no shuttering and the 3D is simply much more comfortable and feels less rigid. I get less tired; I don't get headaches with this one. My theory is that because you've now got some wiggle room while you play on the new machine, your eyes (or brain, I'm no doctor) can relax into it. The screens are otherwise similarly bright... and similarly low-res compared to your smartphone. The rest With the New 3DS LL, the black model has a slight granite sparkle on the interior, something not found on the older 3DS XL, while the New 3DS we tested had a nice matte white finish, with SNES-themed colored input buttons. It's a nice touch and combined with the optional, customizable plates, it pushes the smaller model into the lead, at least aesthetically. Unfortunately, the bigger model (and yes, I still otherwise swear by that larger screen), doesn't get the chance to dress up. For the New 3DS, covers cost between 1,000 and 3,000 yen ($9-$30), with the top price getting you a fancy Pok\u00e9mon fabric casing and other luxurious options, like metallic and even wood finishes. The panels are attached by screws and you'll also need a screwdriver to access the removable battery and the microSD card slot. Given the curious way Nintendo deals with SD storage for the 3DS (you can only use one card on one machine), it makes sense to have it here. You're unlikely to have to unscrew the panel once you've upgraded from the default 4GB card that comes inside the device. Speaking of what's inside, Nintendo swapped out the processors for something a little more powerful, resulting in visibly faster loading times. Our own test, where I loaded up Super Smash Bros. from a cartridge, speaks volumes. The New 3DS LL got me to the title screen in 15 seconds, with the New 3DS trailing in 18; last year's 3DS XL, meanwhile, took a criminal 34 seconds. It seems the game itself is pretty processor-intensive, because bouncing back to the home screen on the old 3DS XL often took the system about five seconds to react. For the new models, it's a less-noticeable couple of seconds. (In fact, Japanese site 4gamers recorded all four model's attempts to load games, as well as other things. The original 3DS did even worse.) When it comes to power, our testing so far nets a power-drain pretty similar to 2012's 3DS XL: Full-tilt mode (full brightness, 3D mode, roughly an hour of online gaming) will sap the new 3DS LL's battery in around four hours. When I went more sparingly with the brightness and switched on the power-saving mode, I squeezed out close to nine hours of playtime. Switch to simpler original DS games and you'll see even better mileage. Software This may be new hardware, but it's the same software running inside the clamshell portable. Nintendo was sharp enough to bring a recent update to all its 3DS models, adding customizable home screen themes and generally tidying up of the console's menus and options. Otherwise, not much has changed here. You can feel the benefits of a hardier processor when shopping for games online and downloading them, but this is by no means a smartphone or a tablet. Try using the built-in browser, and generally despair. You'll have all the Street Pass sharing and game features found on other 3DSes (and explained in our original review). Buying games online has been sped up a little, but it's still pretty darn laborious. Again, the processor sped up nearly all tasks compared to the existing 3DS consoles -- on both the New 3DS and the New 3DS LL. Wrap-up You've probably changed your phone at least once in the last three years, how about your 3DS? Now, a new DS is likely to be much cheaper, But is it necessary? Well, it depends on how much you game. Fortunately for Nintendo, gaming on its current portable continues to get better. Since our last 3DS review, we've now got multiple Zelda titles, Mario Kart 7, a new Pok\u00e9mon title and a wealth of other incredible titles. (Fold in existing games as well as backward compatibility with the venerable DS and there's a lot of gaming to be done.) My main reason for recommending the system right now, or at least when it launches in the US and Europe sometime next year, is that the 3D effect is no longer a chore: Things still pop out, but now it doesn't make my eyes sore. As I said at the start, I'm now willingly turning on the 3D effect with these new devices -- something I hardly ever did with either the original or the XL model. And isn't that effect half the point of a 3DS? onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: 3ds, 3dsll, 3dsxl, handheld, new 3ds, new3ds, new3dsxl, nintendo, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20982050 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20982050\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/nintendo/3ds/\"> Nintendo 3DS </a> Nintendo 3DS Buy from $183 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/nintendo/3ds/\" title=\"Nintendo 3DS reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 103 </a> Prices Discussions Game format Downloadable, Cartridge Screen size 3.53 inches Online features Multiplayer, Store, Browser Direction control D-pad, Thumb stick (1) Motion controls Accelerometer, Camera / optical Dimensions 0.8 x 5.3 x 2.9 in Weight 8 oz Released 2011-03-27 see all specs \u2192 7.6average user rating Game library 6.4 Graphics 8.3 Battery life 6.1 Portability (size / weight) 8.3 Durability 8 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $183.99 + tax & shipping Buy now 14 Capacitive displays on the 3DS 3 (Ninetndo 3DS), So here is an interesting thought. 2 What do you think?

Otherwise known as Valve's plan to take on the living room. The project had my attention for months, with Valve teasing a revolutionary controller, a custom operating system and even an army of hardware partners at CES 2014. Now, almost a year later, those PC manufacturers are ready to unleash their products on the world, with or without Valve. But what happens when you launch a Steam Machine without the project's progenitor? You get the iBuyPower SBX: a $549 Windows 8 desktop ($399 without the OS or accessories) designed to be an entertainment hub. So can Steam's Big Picture mode survive without the backbone of Steam OS or the company's oddball touch controller? Let's find out. Gallery | 19 Photos iBuyPower SBX review + See all 19 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 65 iBuyPower SBX Pros Attractive custom chassis\u00a0 Enormous PC game library Easy to set up Cons Console mode is easily broken by pop-ups and Windows errors Many games run better on traditional consoles Some issues with crashing and freezing Summary The iBuyPower SBX will look at home in your entertainment center, but it won\u2019t survive there without a mouse and keyboard.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Let's set aside all the PC parts used inside the SBX, and instead take in the machine's facade: a thick, stylized box that looks a lot like a modern video game console. It's a visual marriage of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, combining the bold size and hard corners of the former with the split-level chassis of the latter. A multicolored LED strip pulses around the device's perimeter, too -- a design flourish often found in PC gaming peripherals. It's a clean, simple design, but it's also symbolic of everything the product wants to be: a media center that bridges the gap between consoles and PC games. Overall, the SBX errs on the console side, with very few bells and whistles. The front of the device features just two buttons: power and an LED control that cycles through an assortment of animated, static, rotating or pulsating colors (including a \"rainbow dance party\" mode, my personal favorite). The LED strip can also be disabled if you find it distracting. Two USB (2.0) ports live on the machine's right side, but most of the action is on the SBX's back: two more USB (3.0) ports, HDMI, DVI, VGA, Ethernet, a power supply and a small collection of analog audio plugs. Although there are four USB ports on the chassis, one is already spoken for: The SBX ships with an Xbox 360 controller and an Xbox 360 controller wireless adapter. Installing it is as easy as plugging it in and starting up the system (iBuyPower has preinstalled the dongle's drivers). When you do turn the SBX on, it automatically boots into Steam Big Picture mode too, completing the illusion that iBuyPower's new media center PC is really a game console. Unfortunately, that illusion isn't perfect. The 'console' problem For all of its efforts to look like a modern game console, it's hard to forget that the SBX is a PC -- one that was never intended to reach the market in its current state. That isn't to say it's half-baked or poorly made, but the product was designed to coincide with Valve's Steam Machine Initiative, a program that would have equipped the SBX with a dual-touchpad game controller and a special build of Linux designed specifically for televisions. Despite making quite a lot of noise at CES 2014, the program hasn't launched, which means the SBX (and every other pre-Steam Machine) has to make do without it. This leaves us with Windows 8 and the aforementioned Xbox 360 gamepad: both great options for PC gamers, but neither suited to a \"PC console\" wedged into your entertainment center. It's not that the setup can't work; it's just that it doesn't always work. The console-like illusion of Steam's Big Picture mode is easily broken by game launchers, Windows errors or games that aren't configured to launch in full-screen mode by default. It's true that some games (like Borderlands 2 and The Witcher 2) feature some rudimentary gamepad support in their launchers, but most titles with pre-game prompts will break the experience. A careful user can attempt to avoid these kinds of situations by choosing to play games that feature a solid controller icon -- Steam's indication that a title features full gamepad support. Most of the time, this works, but it's not always accurate: Final Fantasy IV, for instance, claims to be 100 percent controller compatible, but still brings Big Picture mode to a screeching halt with an obtrusive, mouse-only launcher. All you have to do is click \"play\" to load a full, controller-friendly experience, but this seemingly simple task is impossible without a mouse. This isn't a new problem (anyone who's ever tried to use Steam on a TV has faced it), but it's particularly nagging on a PC that wants to be seen as a game console. The SBX boots up in the vain hope that its user will only ever need the Xbox 360 gamepad that ships with it, and that just isn't the case. It may be impossible to forget that the SBX is a PC that merely masquerades as a game console, but that doesn't mean it isn't still pretty darn fun. Despite needing occasional prodding from a mouse cursor, Steam's Big Picture mode does a good job of translating the PC's basic functions into a gamepad-manageable format. I integrated it into my normal gaming setup for several weeks, and thoroughly enjoyed having easy, lazy access to my favorite PC games from my couch. In fact, if I didn't see the Windows desktop pop up during the SBX boot sequence, I'd almost be ready to believe that the SBX is a real console, at least initially. The 10-foot interface not only offers simple, clear menus for navigating the Steam store, buying and installing games and managing basic social functions, but it also provides access to basic settings: screen resolution, microphone audio settings and even the ability to restart, sleep or shut down the machine without touching Windows. If all you want to do with your PC console is play controller-compatible Steam games, it's perfect. Want to do more? Be prepared to run into some more \"mouse and keyboard\" problems. Steam's TV interface has menus that allow you to add non-Steam programs to the 10-foot-display, but it doesn't do anything to help you navigate those programs once they've launched. This is problematic because Steam isn't the only PC game marketplace out there, and it doesn't have everything. Want to play popular shooters like Titanfall or anything from the Battlefield series? You need to download EA's Origin -- a desktop content-delivery platform without controller support. In theory, you could use a mouse and keyboard to download games on other platforms, set them up to launch through Steam and never worry about it again, but this breaks down on a game-to-game basis. Battlefield 3 and 4, for instance, launch through a clunky web-browser interface. No mouse input, no game. Although the SBX is built with gaming in mind, it does take up residence in your entertainment center. Can it be used as a media player? Sort of. Steam has a built-in music player, but you'll still need a mouse and keyboard to load the PC up with your files. The interface's web browser seems to play nice with most video-streaming services (YouTube, Hulu and network sites like ABC all worked fine), but Netflix's website asked me to download the Windows 8 app, forcing me to reach for traditional computer peripherals yet again. Can it be fixed? Okay, you probably get it by now: the iBuypower SBX isn't a Steam Machine, and it suffers for it. But what if it were? By borrowing a first-generation Steam Controller from an industry friend, I was able to find out. The truth is, using the SBX as a \"real\" Steam Machine is kind of a mixed bag, but that isn't iBuyPower's fault. Without a doubt, Valve's dual-touch gamepad is a much better way to handle Windows 8 from a couch. In the Steam Interface, it acts a lot like the Xbox 360 controller, navigating the menu with basic up, down, left and right directions and selecting items with the buttons -- but as soon as a Windows 8 element pops up, things change. The right touchpad immediately becomes a sort of emulated trackball, \"rolling\" under the thumb with a (surprisingly loud) haptic vibration. It feels familiar and almost natural. With few exceptions, I failed to find a single hiccup that couldn't be dealt with using the Steam Controller's mouse mode. I could even use it to call up the Windows 8 virtual keyboard, which allowed me to enter text and manage passwords in programs outside the influence of Steam's gamepad interface. The Steam UI changed as soon as I plugged the controller in, too -- new icons representative of the prototype's odd button layout appeared on the screen, and a new option for tweaking the controller's configuration showed up in Steam's in-game overlay menu. Having an option to customize the controller's output on a game-by-game basis was nice, but usually I didn't have to use it: Most games seemed to already have default Steam Controller layouts assigned to them. Some of these layouts are sourced from the community, while others simply emulate the Xbox 360 gamepad. Either way, it almost always worked. While the Steam Controller was clearly superior for piloting a PC from my couch, it wasn't always the better gamepad. Some games (like FPS and action titles) just didn't feel right under the prototype's pressure pads, and not all of the controller-customization options in the Steam interface worked correctly. There were also times when I wanted to switch the controller from gamepad to \"mouse mode,\" and wasn't able to. That's all fine -- the Steam Controller is a prototype and it's not under review here -- but the fact that I preferred to use it as a companion device for navigating Windows over an all-in-one gamepad shows that Valve's Steam Machine project just isn't ready to launch. Which is probably why it hasn't. Using both the Steam Controller and Xbox 360 gamepad simultaneously worked out as the best compromise for me, but that's not an option for general consumers. The folks at iBuyPower tell me that an app is coming that will allow users to control the mouse and keyboard from their smartphone, but it won't be available until early December -- and the first version will only be able to tweak the SBX's LED lightshow. Peripheral emulation won't come until later. This could conceivably be a tolerable solution to the machine's mouse and keyboard woes, but launching without the functionality feels like a misstep. Gameplay Let's assume you've worked out how to handle pop-up game launchers, Windows errors and any other half-measure the SBX can throw at you, and you're ready to play some games. How do they run? That depends on your perspective. As a PC, the SBX performs on par with what you'd expect from its spec list: With a 3.1GHz AMD Athlon X4 840 CPU, 4GB of RAM and a Radeon R7 250X GPU, the SBX is a haven for middling graphics settings. I found most games ran best on their respective \"medium\" graphics presets, and indeed, this is what most games defaulted to as their \"optimal configurations.\" Battlefield 4, for instance, averaged 48 frames per second on medium, with Crysis 3 and Titanfall clocking in at 35 and 30 fps, respectively. Some games did a little better, of course: Tomb Raider ran at 66 fps on medium settings, and sustained a cool 45 fps on high. Other titles could even manage Ultra configurations: both BioShock Infinite and Alien: Isolation maintained a respectable 34 fps on maximum settings -- but this was typically the exception, not the rule. Objectively, I didn't expect anything more from the SBX -- I knew its technical specifications going in, and I knew it wasn't designed as a graphical powerhouse. Still, the machine falls into a category of media PCs that competes directly with contemporary game consoles, and that forces me to think about its performance in a completely different way. Pitted against the same games on a console, the SBX usually fared worse. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, for instance, ran noticeably smoother on my PlayStation 4 than it did on the SBX, featuring higher-resolution textures (vs. the \"optimal\" settings on the SBX) and faster loading times. Ryse, a game that debuted on the Xbox One, stuttered heavily on the SBX, and failed to break 30 fps even on its lowest settings. While that assessment might not be completely fair (after all, consoles often run games at a lower resolution than their PC counterparts), it's still important. By and large, I tried to treat the SBX as the kind of device it's being marketed as: a game console. This means I accepted the default resolution and graphics settings it gave me when I first started a game, and in the above cases, it was a notably worse experience than I found on consoles. That said, a savvy user can easily trade frame rate and texture quality for resolution and indeed, I was able to score higher frame rates and better texture resolution by running games below my TV's native 1080p resolution. Even if you discard the above direct comparison to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, be warned that the SBX still isn't a game console. It's a weird PC. That's okay, but that classification comes with a lot of caveats. In addition to constantly needing to tweak settings, grab keyboards and wrestle with game launchers, I had the SBX freeze up on me multiple times in games, forcing me to manually reset the device using the power button. This didn't happen frequently, but even one total system lockup is too many. Even with all of these problems, however, I have to admit that I had genuine fun playing with the SBX. It couldn't keep pace with my current-gen consoles, but it did outclass my Xbox 360's older games. It's also a window to the wonderful world of Steam sales and the general trend of PC games simply costing less than their console counterparts. If you're willing to juggle a mouse and keyboard, hurdle a few errors and occasionally mutter frustrated profanities at your television, the SBX can still be a worthwhile addition to your entertainment center -- but its joys will often be hard won. Wrap-up In many ways, the iBuyPower SBX is a product ahead of its time -- but not in a revolutionary way. Behind its attractive custom case, colorful lights and the facade of Steam's Big Picture mode, the SBX is still just a desktop PC in a living room-friendly chassis. At $549, it's not a bad value for what it is (I parted-out a similar system to the tune of $553), but it feels like an incomplete package: Valve's 10-foot interface isn't enough to take on the living room by itself, and iBuyPower offers nothing to bridge the gap between Steam and Windows 8. If so-called Steam Machines are going to succeed without Valve, they need to offer more than just Big Picture mode. The SBX is trying to take on a market that hasn't emerged yet, and it feels woefully unprepared for the task. It's a shame, too: The potential of a home theater gaming PC shines behind the SBX's faults, but not brightly enough to make up for them. At the end of my time with the SBX, I was left wishing it was just a little better, and I'm genuinely sad that it isn't. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: iBuyPower SBX, ibuypowersbx, review, sbx, steam machine, steam machines, steammachine, steammachines, uk-reviews, valve \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20996311 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20996311\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/ibuypower/sbx/\"> iBuyPower SBX </a> iBuyPower SBX Raw SBX + Controller SBX + Controller and Windows SBX Plus Buy from $399 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/ibuypower/sbx/\" title=\"iBuyPower SBX reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 0 </a> Prices Discussions Type Gaming CPU family Athlon Processor speed 3.1 GHz System RAM 4 GB Hard drive(s) 500 GB\u00a0(total) Video outputs DVI, HDMI, VGA Announced 2014-01-06 see all specs \u2192 There are not any reviews for this product yet.

That's the mantra Motorola went by when it designed and developed the Moto 360, and judging by the enthusiastic response the watch received when it was unveiled earlier this year, plenty of people agree. The Moto 360 is undoubtedly the best-looking of the three inaugural Android Wear watches (the LG G Watch and the Samsung Gear Live are the other two), with its premium leather strap, chamfered glass and circular design. As Motorola designer Jim Wicks said in an interview, \"We wanted to hit that 'Whoa!' mark.\" And so it did. But is that enough? In the past few days, I struggled to like this watch, even though it's the best Android Wear device available today. Allow me to tell you why. Gallery | 33 Photos Moto 360 review + See all 33 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 76 Motorola Moto 360 Pros \u00a0Beautiful design Comfortable and lightweight Leather and metal straps Ambient light sensor Wireless charging Cons Terrible battery life Large size isn't for everyone Pricey for an Android Wear watch Charging cradle doesn't come with a USB cable Summary The Moto 360 is the most attractive Android Wear device you can buy right now, with a design that's more reminiscent of a regular watch. Even so, it suffers from poor battery life, just like other early smartwatches, and it has a higher price, too. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware The Moto 360's claim to fame is that it's the first Android Wear device with a round face. And that's a big deal. As I said, when it comes to an item that you wear on your person, it's crucial that it looks good. Compared to the other two Android Wear watches on the market, the Moto 360 looks the most like an actual timepiece partially due to that round design. Indeed, one of the reasons Motorola went with a circular design is that it believes a round face is simply more watch-like. Of course, there are traditional analog watches with square designs too, but the 360's round face does make it stand out in a sea of square smartwatches. Motorola made a conscious decision to make the 360 more watch than gadget; more mainstream than early adopter; more SoHo than Silicon Valley. That thought process included not just the shape of the watch, but also the materials used to make it. The housing is constructed from glass and stainless steel, and the leather strap is sourced from a high-end Chicago tannery. It's a smartwatch that actually feels comfortable when worn; the leather feels much softer and more flexible than the rubber straps on the G Watch and the Gear Live. What's more, with the leather strap, the Moto 360 is also quite a bit lighter at 49 grams (the G Watch weighs 63; Gear Live, 59). In other words, the 360 not only looks like a regular watch, but it also feels like one. If you can't decide on just what color to get -- the initial watchbands come in black, dark gray or light gray -- the straps are thankfully interchangeable. However, do note that you'll need to visit a jeweler to swap them out and Motorola says the 360 is only compatible with straps made specifically for it. Later this year, Motorola plans to release a Moto 360 with metal bands, which is more in-tune with the style of the thick metal housing. That brings me to one of my problems with the Moto 360. While I don't deny that the Moto 360 is well-crafted, its 46mm diameter and 11.5mm thickness paired with the leather bands make it much too big for me. I felt a little embarrassed to be wearing such an enormous, attention-grabbing timepiece, and my husband remarked that it looked like I had a hockey puck strapped to my wrist. During a tour of Motorola's headquarters recently, we were told that the 360 was designed for both men and women -- apparently large watches are trendy accessories for some folks these days -- but I'm simply not one of them. Of course, this is based entirely on personal preference. And again, even though it's not to my taste, the Moto 360 is still one of the most striking smartwatches I've seen yet. Display The primary reason for that is the circular display. It goes practically edge to edge with pixels spread across the entire surface, leaving a sliver of a bezel around it. The result is a watch face that's nearly all screen, which isn't something you can say about the Gear Live or the G Watch. That's a good thing, especially as the Moto 360's screen is a touch smaller at 1.56 inches across, resulting in a 320 x 290 resolution that translates to 205 pixels per inch. It's not the sharpest display by any means, but it's also not bad for such a tiny screen; it seems clear and colorful enough to me. Unfortunately, there's a rather noticeable black slice at the bottom that mars the display's circular perfection. Motorola says that in order to maximize the screen size of a small and round display, it opted to house the watch's display drivers and ambient light sensor in that little wedge instead of creating a thick circular bezel. If that is indeed the trade-off, I agree that the edge-to-edge chamfered glass is a better option. But if you're even the slightest bit of a perfectionist, that tiny, little black slice might be difficult to un-see. Additionally, round displays and Android Wear don't always get along. Motorola apparently worked closely with Google to ensure that the UI would play nicely with a round screen, and it succeeded -- for the most part. Text occasionally gets cut off at the corners, especially when scrolling through messages and long lists. Also, the beveled sides make the circular border look a touch jagged at certain angles, especially against a white background. Speaking of that ambient light sensor, the Moto 360 is also the first Android Wear watch to even have one. That means that unlike the G Watch and the Gear Live, the 360 supports auto-brightness, which is extremely handy considering the 360 is equipped with a backlit LCD that would otherwise be unreadable in bright sunlight. It's naturally not quite as crisp as the e-paper display on the Pebble, but it's legible enough that I could make out the time and read my email notifications. And seeing as turning on maximum brightness would likely put a big dent in the battery life, I'm glad the sensor is there. It's important to note here that the ambient light sensor is separate from a Moto 360 watch setting called \"ambient screen.\" This feature is off by default, and what that means is that the watch will go completely black when it's idle or not in use -- it'll only light up when you lift the watch to look at it. When ambient screen is turned on, however, the 360 won't immediately go black when idle. Instead, it dims just enough so that you can still tell the time if you casually glance at it. But if you happen to take the watch off and leave it somewhere, the display will eventually go black, even with ambient screen enabled. In addition to tapping the screen or lifting the watch, you can also activate the display by pressing on a small protruding crown on the right. If you hold it down, you'll bring up the watch's settings menu -- a welcome little shortcut, as getting to it would normally take a number of steps. Pressing and holding on the screen will bring up a selection of watch faces that have been customized for the 360's round display. You can adjust the different watch face settings even further with Motorola's own Connect app. I like the Dials face option the best because it lets me see what time it is in two other cities -- a handy thing when you work with a global team. Now, you might be wondering how you charge this watch; it's not like there are any ports to plug in a cable. Instead, the Moto 360 charges wirelessly via Qi magnetic induction. Just set it inside the included charging cradle and the watch will get the juice it needs to keep going. When docked, the Moto 360 will display a digital clock along with how much charge it still has. This way, you can use it as a bedside alarm clock if you like. It works as promised, but I do wish Motorola had included a USB-only cable in the box in addition to one that requires a power outlet. Since the 360 charges via the Qi standard, you could theoretically charge it on an existing Qi wireless charger if you happen to have one already. Features Phew. That was a lot of words just about the watch's design. But seeing that most of the watch's features are the same as the other Android Wear devices -- Google isn't allowing manufacturer-specific skins -- the 360's main differentiator is its design. But if you'd like a brief recap, here's what Android Wear offers. Beyond just telling the time, Android Wear is a platform that transmits what's on your phone to what's on your wrist. If you allow it, you'll see everything from emails to Twitter notifications to Google Now cards popping up on the watch. There's some notification anxiety as a result -- having to scroll through all of those can be a pain, especially as you can't quite ignore them as easily as you might on a phone. As with the other Android Wear watches, you navigate through the 360's interface by swiping and tapping on the watch's touchscreen display. A key component is voice commands, where you can say things like \"Navigate\" to find directions or \"Call a car\" to request a Lyft ride. For more details on Android Wear, check out our full review. Beyond Android Wear, the 360 does have a couple extra features that bear mentioning. Remember that Motorola Connect app I alluded to earlier? That's also where you can track your steps and heart rate, because the 360 not only has a built-in pedometer, but it also has a heart rate sensor as well (it's located on the underside of the watch). As with the Gear Live, you do need to hold your wrist relatively still for the sensor to read your beats per minute, but it only takes a few seconds. Additionally, the Moto 360's heart rate app also comes with an activity monitor that tracks how active you are in a day. Once you enter in your vital stats (height, weight and so forth), the app will attempt to divvy up your daily heart activity into three categories: \"Inactive,\" \"Active\" and \"Vigorous.\" Motorola's goal here is for you to get at least 30 minutes of moderate activity a day for five days. As the 360 periodically keeps an eye on your bpm, it'll know to notify you if you're almost or at your goal. From my experience with the 360, achieving this 30-minute moderate activity goal is pretty easy -- just walking around the house and the local farmer's market got me to my goal before noon. Still, it's a noble enough objective and gives us the illusion that we're trying to be healthy. Battery life and performance There's probably a subset of you that completely disregarded everything I've written above and came right down to this section. And I don't blame you. After all, what's the point of a watch that runs out of battery in the middle of the day? The problem, of course, is that the Moto 360 isn't a normal watch. Just like the other Android Wear devices, it comes with a rather dinky battery. The official specs state 320mAh, though a recent teardown reveals that the battery actually has \"300mAh\" printed on it. Motorola's official statement is that the battery offers a range of 300 to 320mAh, but opted to print just \"300mAh\" due to the lack of space. Regardless of which it is, the battery is still tiny. Under heavy use, the 360 barely lasts the day. With the ambient screen mode on, I had it so that it would notify me of every incoming email, message and notification from apps like Twitter, Facebook and Google Now. I also tried out a couple of different navigation routes and used voice commands several times throughout the day. In about 12 hours, the 360's battery life dropped to 9 percent. It's not pretty, to say the least. However, in the days after the initial thrill of playing with the 360, I found myself hardly ever using the watch in such an active manner. I mostly just relied on it for timekeeping and notifications -- I rarely bothered using it for voice commands or navigation, since, well, I could just use the phone for that. With this kind of minimal use, it got to around 23 percent after 12 hours, which is enough to last through a typical day. But if you're not going to use a smartwatch as a smartwatch, that kind of defeats the purpose of getting one. Plus, even with such skimping, I still had to charge the watch every night. Under the hood, the Moto 360 has a TI OMAP3630 processor, which is surprisingly old technology -- we're talking the kind of chip used in the Droid 2. Yet, I didn't encounter too much sluggishness when swiping through the menu or scrolling through messages. I did notice the occasional hiccup when trying to remove notifications -- sometimes it took a couple of swipe attempts instead of one -- but they were few and far between. The competition Android Wear is so new that the Moto 360 only has two other direct competitors, at least for now. When it comes to look and feel, however, both the Samsung Gear Live and LG G Watch pale in comparison to the 360. Unfortunately, better look and feel come at a price -- the watch is far more expensive at $250 with a leather strap and $299 with a metal one. Worse, the battery life here is the shortest of the bunch. Additionally, the 360's honeymoon period as the only round-faced Android Wear watch will be short-lived as both LG and Samsung are trying their hands at circular designs too. If the 360's rotund face is the only factor you're considering in a smartwatch, you might do best to wait to see if you like those. It's worth noting, for example, that while the 360 has that black slice at the bottom of its circular display, the upcoming LG G Watch R doesn't. From a brief hands-on we had with it at IFA, however, we can definitively say that the 360 is still the nicer, more premium option. I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention the most recent rival to the Moto 360: the Apple Watch. It remains to be seen how intuitive the UI is in real-world use, but in terms of design and style (not to mention app support), it looks like the 360 has some serious competition afoot. Wrap-up With its stylish good looks, comfortable feel and overall premium build, the Moto 360 is the Android Wear watch to beat. When it comes to design, at least, it outclasses everything else on the market. Aside from aesthetics, the 360 offers many of the same features as its rivals, including a heart rate sensor and a pedometer, plus some other goodies like wireless charging and an ambient light sensor. Even with the design, though, Motorola didn't totally get it right. The 360's large size is a legitimate concern for narrow-wristed individuals, and the experience is dampened by various imperfections that include cutoff notifications and that \"flat tire\" at the bottom of the screen. What's more, the battery life is actually worst in class -- and that's saying a lot considering other Android Wear watches also need to be charged once a day. All told, the smartwatch landscape is so new that I'd recommend waiting to see if something better comes along. Sure, the Moto 360 is the best option right now, but it might be obsolete in just a few months. That said, if you want to jump on the Android Wear wagon now, the Moto 360 is your best bet. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android wear, androidwear, mobilepostcross, moto 360, moto360, motorola, review, smartwatch, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20958570 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20958570\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android-wear/\"> Google Android Wear </a> Google Android Wear Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android-wear/\" title=\"Google Android Wear reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Type Mobile / embedded OS Source model Open Released 2014-07-07 see all specs \u2192 7average user rating Ease of use 8 Speed 4 Configurability 2 Ecosystem (apps, drivers, etc.) 10 Openness 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 0 Moto 360 Pricing 0 Smartwatch that keeps the calendar locally? 2 Best Must Have Apps For Android Wear Talk about the Google Android Wear with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/moto/360/\"> Motorola Moto 360 </a> Motorola Moto 360 Buy from $179 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/moto/360/\" title=\"Motorola Moto 360 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 23 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Other Operating system Android Screen size 1.5 inches Released 2014-09-05 see all specs \u2192 8.1average user rating Features 8.1 Display 8.3 Battery life 6.5 Ease of use 8.6 Storage capacity 8.9 Design and form factor 9.1 Portability (size / weight) 9 Durability 8.5 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $179.00 + tax & shipping Buy now 15 What's the deal with smartwatches? 1 ....this or iWatch? 4 Google I/O is tomorrow Talk about the Motorola Moto 360 with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 lab.scriptBs('gravity.js') onBreak({ 0: function(){}, 320: function(){}, 768: function(){} }); ", "title": "Moto 360 review: It's the best Android Wear watch, but that isn't saying much"},

Unless, perhaps, it's cool-looking, or dirt cheap. Being able to keep tabs on how active you've been (or not) is certainly helpful; the problem is it's only one part of the picture. A fitness tracker might know I hustled my way through a 5K run this morning, but it doesn't know about the waffle-mania breakfast I enjoyed straight after. Some products work around this by letting you log your food intake. I'm prone to \"forgetting\" to log my meals, though, including the guilty, post-run carb-fest breakfasts. The dream fitness wearable, then, would be one that tracks your activity, auto-logs your sleep and knows what you've eaten without you telling it. Enter GoBe, by Healbe, a $300 wearable that promises to do exactly that.

Improve that too, and it's health device of the decade. Unfortunately, while those problems persist, it's just a $300 activity tracker in an already competitive market. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") \"GoBe You\" is the product's marketing tag line. The idea is simple: a wearable that can provide a complete picture of your daily \"health.\" A device that can tell if you've consumed more calories than you've burned (or vice versa), judge the quality and duration of your sleep, count water intake, measure stress levels and more. The idea being it provides you a single number that represents your daily calorie balance (how many over or under you are) based on all the key metrics, and not just one or two. If you're at all into health, fitness, dieting, well-being or just taking good care of yourself, this probably sounds too good to be true. Unsurprisingly, there are a number of vocal critics that say it is too good to be true. Healbe's big claims have been questioned, with many saying that it's just not possible to measure calorie intake the way the company says it does (more on that later). These boasts even led some people to think GoBe was an outright crowdfunding scam. But, the product is here. It exists. I'm wearing one right now. Controversy aside, there's only really one way to find out if it works: by putting it to task. I ate in the name of science (well, gadget reviews at least) to see if it can prove the critics wrong. Background I'm here to test the actual product, but it's worth knowing a little bit of background for context. Healbe launched an Indiegogo campaign for GoBe back in March 2014. It raised over $1 million by the time it finished. Many were (rightly) worried about the company meeting the ambitious summer launch window. The product caught the attention of doubters in the media. Automatically measuring calorie intake would be kind of a big deal, so it's not surprising eyebrows were raised when these unknowns claimed to have cracked it. Healbe says it works by using an impedance sensor that detects fluid levels in your tissue. The theory (broadly) being that as you consume food, your body converts it to glucose, and cells release water as they absorb it. GoBe measures this movement of fluid and uses algorithms to reverse engineer that into a number of calories. For a more in-depth explanation from Healbe go here. The controversy stems from the fact that several medical professionals think measuring calories this way just isn't possible. Not only that, but also if this device can non-invasively measure glucose in the blood, then there's a whole world of diabetics that would probably like to know (and in turn, provide the makers with a life relaxing on a beach in the process). PandoDaily, in particular, took Healbe to task on the validity of its claims (repeatedly), which you can read for yourself in full here. But, there's a difference between four-minute mile \"impossible\" and faster-than-the-speed-of-light \"impossible.\" It's our job to give the product a crack at proving people wrong. Hardware It's a wrist-worn device. That much you probably figured out. Unlike other slim, discreet(ish) activity trackers, GoBe is a huge metallic token embedded in a plastic strap. There's one button, and a perforated top section hides a rudimentary LED display. The bottom of the GoBe has two contacts for charging, and the metal sensors that touch the skin. While wearing it, more than one person told me it looked like a GPS tagging device, the kind you might attach to criminals out on bail. The strap is kinda chunky, and (on my sample at least) the pin is prone to poking out, occasionally catching my skin, or rubbing against my laptop, et cetera. It's not the most handsome device, but it's inoffensive, and the dark gray strap can be swapped out for an included, and showier, purple one if you so choose. GoBe contains three sensors: that impedance sensor, an accelerometer and a pressure sensor. Together, they measure calories, activity and heart rate, respectively. The latter two combine to measure your sleep (i.e., when you're not moving and your pulse goes down). The data connectivity is done over Bluetooth to your phone (there's a companion app as you probably imagined). While charging is handled by a proprietary cradle with a micro-USB connection. GoBe is also waterproof to three meters making it shower- and swim-friendly. When it comes to wearing, it's not uncomfortable, but the size of the actual tracker/sensor part means it stands out from the wrist by well over a centimeter, almost two at the thickest part. I also found that after showering, it could get a little itchy where the sensors make contact with your skin. If you've ever had a similar experience with a cheap digital watch, it's very much like that. As for the battery, Healbe claims you'll get three days use out of it when you buy one. However, I was told the one I received was an early version, and had a less-capacious battery. It shows, too. We've asked that we get to try the final retail battery, but until we do, we're just reporting on what we have, with the caveat that Healbe claims it's not representative of the final product. Software The hardware may be a little bulky, but the companion app is slick. Available for both iOS and Android, the app is where you'll set up your device and see all your stats. The pairing process was relatively simple; the app asks you to switch on your GoBe, and once it spots it, you pair just like any other Bluetooth device. You'll then be prompted to tell it your vitals so that it can better measure your calories burned and whatnot (based on size, age, gender and all the usual stuff). Once you've taken care of the formalities, you'll be handed over to the main interface of the app, which includes five sections: Energy, Water, Heart, Sleep and Stress. As you can see, GoBe does more than just measure food intake. Swipe each section's icon over to the left, and you'll get a brief summary -- total calories consumed, hours slept, etc. Swipe over again, and you'll get a deeper dive. Below is a breakdown of the information GoBe serves up. The main section is called \"My Energy Balance.\" A circular icon at the top serves as a kind of visual shortcut. The circle starts half-filled, and the amount inside will grow or shrink depending on your calorific intake (whether you're over or under the amount needed to balance what you've burned). Below this, in a big font, is the number showing your current deficit or excess in KCAL. Basically, how far over or under your daily requirements you are. Keep scrolling down and you'll get a macronutrient breakdown (or GoBe's guess at it). This is how many grams of protein, fat and carbohydrates you've consumed. It'll even give you a number for how many of those you've converted back into energy. Beneath the hard numbers, you'll find a graph broken down into hourly increments. It'll show pink upward spikes/blobs when you've logged food, and darker declines representing when you've burned calories. All of the info in this view represents one day. Swipe right to see your data from the previous days. There's no option to sort the view to weekly or monthly, and the app only lets you go back over the last six days. You'll have to log on via the Healbe website if you want to look back further (and still, without any alternative ways to represent trends in your data). This screen is also where you'll find information about your activity/daily steps. No medals for figuring out what the \"My Water Balance\" section is all about. GoBe can't detect when you drink liquids, so you have to tell it manually. It's easy: Just tell it your glass size, and it'll calculate how many you need a day, divided into glasses. Drink one; go to the app; tap one glass; and it'll go from full to empty. The main screen for this section also has an interactive icon that goes from empty to full as you progress toward your goal. The big number here shows the number of ml/oz needed to go before you hit your target. You can't manually change the figure it thinks you need. Currently, it tells me I need 3.4 liters (about 115 ounces) a day. That's quite a lot. The three other sections let you monitor heart rate, sleep and stress levels (respectively). Each of these has fewer metrics, giving just a broad overview of information. Heading to the heart rate screen, you'll be able to see your current pulse, and take a blood pressure reading. I found this relied heavily on the base blood pressure metric you tell it on sign up (I had to guess; it's been a while since I had mine checked). The sleep section will show you when, and how deep you were sleeping, with a few other metrics (more on those later). Lastly, the stress section will tell you how, well, stressed you appear to be. This is gauged based on your sleep, heart rate and other general data (e.g., height, age). While the software is attractively designed, simple to use and offers an easy view of your personal data, it doesn't offer you much insight beyond that. There are currently no ways to compare your data week on week, month on month. Nor is there a way to manually enter food if, for example, you weren't wearing the GoBe while you consumed it. The app also only shows the last six days' worth of data. So, as I mentioned earlier, you need to head over to the Healbe website if you want to look any further back. Even then, that's more or less all you can do. There's no way to export or import anything. These are, of course, all problems that can be solved easily enough. Right now, however, there are some pretty big gaps. In use \"Tell it nothing. Know everything.\" It's the message you'll see on Healbe's website, when referring to its GoBe device. While this is the dream, it's only true in the minds of Healbe's marketing department right now. Yes, you don't need to log food manually. But, you do still need to tell it when you've eaten, or else you'll get no data. In fact, beyond whether the method for calorie tracking actually works or not, this is the GoBe's biggest problem. Ideally, you're supposed to give a short two-second press of the GoBe's sole button to let it know you're about to eat. The idea being that the GoBe knows any data from the impedance sensor from that point on, for the next 15 to 30 minutes, will be affected by what you just ate. That's fair enough, but it rather spoils the idea of it being automatic. I forgot several times in my testing, usually about halfway through a meal. There is something of a backup plan, but it presents its own challenge. When you open the app (which triggers a sync with the device), if it logged any impedance data, it'll ask you to confirm whether you were eating or not at that time. The idea is that it won't miss the snacks you \"accidentally\" forgot to log, et cetera. The problem is, it's a little overzealous. Sometimes you have to clear more than a dozen pop-ups asking if you ate at a certain time. Confusingly, these times can even be overlapping. (\"Did you eat between 12:00 and 12:25?\" \"Did you eat between 12:15 and 12:35?\" and so on.) When you do this at the end of the day, even with the best of intentions, you forget at what time you were eating that pretzel, or that you had a pretzel at all. The next biggest problem is battery life. I'm being kind here. Really, this problem trumps all the others, because it made the GoBe almost unusable. It's only because I have been confidently informed that the retail product has a bigger battery that I am mentioning it lower than the repeated nags from the app about when you ate. I had to basically make a choice: Log my sleep, or log my food. Getting it to last long enough for both wasn't possible. The battery would run out during sleep, or just before a meal, and you'd need to be near the proprietary charging cradle to quickly top it up. In the end, and for the purposes of this review, I took to leaving it to charge overnight, so that I could start the day fresh. Even then, it'd run out before my evening meal (I eat around 8 or 9PM). What about the real-world results? Mixed at best. Below are three sample days of food I consumed, manually calculated calories and what was logged by the GoBe. Calories: Manually calculated Logged by GoBe Day 1 Meal 1 290 456 Snack 190 436 Meal 2 410 367 Meal 3 450 574 Daily total: 1,340 1,833 Day 2 Meal 1 480 417 Meal 2 1,015 488 Meal 3 562 431 Daily total: 2,057 1,336 Day 3 Meal 1 545 437 Meal 2 1,860 743 Meal 3 I just... couldn't. 0 Daily total: 2,405 1,180 While some individual meals come close, it's pretty clear that over a whole day, the differences add up. On each given day, there's a difference of no less than 500 calories -- that's an entire meal. I do have to take into consideration the fact that it could be the manual count that is wrong, and perhaps GoBe is on the money. I tried to be as accurate as possible with weights, and sourcing calories from Calorieking.com. That's why, on one day, I made a point of going the extra mile, and packed in a lot more calories than usual (mostly via waffles and KFC). The idea was to go to more of an extreme, hoping that the GoBe would follow. It did log more calories for that mega-lunch compared to others, but only just. Here's a second issue. That big lunch took me longer to eat. Healbe advised me to push the button on the GoBe again if there was a 15-minute gap in \"meals.\" I did have to take a break, so I pushed the button again. I'll be honest: It feels a bit like just pushing the button will cause it to log about 400 to 500 calories. None of the macronutrient amounts (proteins, carbohydrates and fat) really tallied either. This is less important than total calories, but being even less accurate (some meals were almost all protein, and still showed as mostly carbs), it becomes pointless. This measuring episode taught me another thing: Going back in history and seeing how many calories were logged for individual meals is difficult. You only get a total for the day, or you can work it out by hovering over the graph, seeing all the small amounts logged every five minutes and adding them up. All of this is made worse by the fact that the battery kept crapping out, meaning I'd have to put it on charge again just before a meal (and remember to do so, et cetera). Very frustrating. How about some good news? When it comes to logging your sleep, GoBe does it better than any fitness tracker I've tried. Best of all (unlike the calorie counting), it truly is automatic. It was kinda creepy to wake up, check the stats and see that it logged my entire sleep almost perfectly. Even naps. Unlike most other trackers, GoBe knows your heart rate throughout the day (something else it seems reliable at measuring). Combine this with movement data from the accelerometer (and, dare I say, a guess that people mostly sleep at night), and the device is armed with more robust data to track when you're in the land of nod. Beyond this, GoBe offers insights into the quality of your sleep, including worrying data about when you experience bradycardia (resting heart rate below 60), arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) and -- the more worrying-sounding -- heart blocks (a term that covers a variety of conditions). I had a few nights where I experienced quite a lot of bradycardia, and anecdotally (I have no idea if this is related), those were days when I woke up feeling like I hadn't slept well. There is, of course, good old-fashioned fitness/activity tracking in the mix, too. Again, GoBe appears to do a decent job of this, logging steps taken with adequate accuracy. Once more, the fact that it has your pulse also means that it does a great job of knowing when you were running that distance, and the impact this will have on your metabolism/calorie expenditure. In theory, all this data would combine to paint a really detailed overview, if the calorie tracking had shown stronger signs of consistency (even being consistently 20 percent above or below would help). Wrap-up GoBe's main crime? It doesn't deliver on its most exciting feature. I sorely wanted GoBe to work. I wanted it to blow my socks off, and allow Healbe to silence its critics, dismissing them as overcautious naysayers. For it to be a Roger Bannister among products. Sadly, when it comes to counting calories, I have no reason to believe that's the case. In its defense, Healbe claims it will continue working to improve the software, but right now, it doesn't provide useful enough data. The second problem is that it's still a device you need to interact with, despite claims to the contrary. You can't just let it do its thing; you need to constantly tell it if you are about to eat, or remember so you can confirm via the app later. Suddenly, the gap between manually logging your food and using the GoBe doesn't seem as vast. On a more positive front, those harshest critics who thought this product was just a scam should have cause to be less quick to judge. It may not deliver on the calorie-counting feature, but Healbe did deliver a product. It's clearly spent time, money and effort to design something that tries to do what it claims. By all the other standards, it's not a half-bad activity tracker. If it somehow bridged the auto-calorie part with some manual food-entry options/shortcuts, it might even be able to claw back some merit as a great holistic proposition. At least in the future. But right now, it's not. There are too many other rough edges for it to deal with. Poor battery life, limited software options and a bulky design could be forgiven if it excelled at something. In combination, however, those flaws conspire to disappoint. Backers who receive theirs won't have a useless device, but it's not the panacea they'd bought into. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: activitytracker, CalorieCounting, fitnesstracker, gobe, Healbe, review \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21139035 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21139035\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/healbe/gobe/\"> Healbe GoBe </a> Healbe GoBe Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/healbe/gobe/\" title=\"Healbe GoBe reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 0 </a> Prices Discussions Type Wearable / clip-on Tracking metrics Motion / steps, Heart rate, Calories, Sleep Released 2015-02 see all specs \u2192 There are not any reviews for this product yet.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/20/amazon-kindle-voyage-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "October 20th 2014 at 9:00 am", "body": " When Amazon introduced an updated version of its flagship Kindle Paperwhite last year, it took the easy way out -- after all, tweaked internals, improved software and slightly better lighting do not a thrilling e-reader make. The 2013 Paperwhite wasn't bad by any stretch, just a bit boring. Now, a year later, Amazon has put together a reader that's anything but. Say hello to the Kindle Voyage. On paper, the new Voyage sounds like a home run. Smaller footprint? High-resolution screen? Something akin to physical page-turn buttons? Sign me up! It's Amazon's first truly premium Kindle, unless you count the dodo that was the DX, and this time around the company's catering to die-hard readers. But here's the real question: Does anyone really need a $199 e-reader (with ads, no less)? In a word, yes. Gallery | 25 Photos Kindle Voyage review + See all 25 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 94 Amazon Kindle Voyage Pros Flush, pixel-dense screen is the best we've seen on any e-reader PagePress buttons are mostly satisfying Thin and light Cons Expensive for a standalone e-reader Base price includes ads Summary With an impressive high-resolution display and a vast content catalog to match, the Kindle Voyage is easily the best e-reader Amazon has ever crafted. Still, its high price tag means it just doesn't make sense for the average reader. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware The last time Amazon's higher-end Kindles got a redesign was two years ago, so it's no surprise that the Voyage represents the most dramatic overhaul since that time Amazon gave up on physical keyboards. Gone is the Kindle's longstanding curvy aesthetic: The Voyage borrows considerably from the Kindle Fire's design language, with a more angular back fashioned out of magnesium and capped with glossy black plastic. The magnesium, as it turns out, was a really good call. After a week of tossing the Voyage in and out of my bag (which is sort of a gadget minefield, to say the least) there weren't any scuffs or smudges that a few seconds of frenzied rubbing couldn't take care of. Alas, the Voyage's matte rear (which is where the power button now lives) is a magnet for your greasy fingerprints, so reading and eating chips is inadvisable if you're stickler for appearances. That magnesium chassis makes the Voyage a little lighter, too, which some of you will notice more than others. If (like me!) you're the sort of person who grips an e-reader in one hand, with a pinky helping to stabilize things, that weight reduction makes a surprisingly significant difference. Oh, you're a two-hander? You probably won't be able to tell. More importantly, the 6-inch E Ink display is finally flush with the rest of the Voyage's body. This might not sound like the biggest improvement -- it's not like the Paperwhite's recessed screen and raised bezels were particularly bothersome -- but it helps the Voyage feel less like a bunch of components cobbled together and more like a single, cohesive piece of kit. Honestly, though, between the lack of raised bezels and that angled back, the whole thing bears more than a passing resemblance to last year's Kobo Aura (I can just imagine Kobo's Japanese overlords chortling with glee). I'll be honest: I still yearn for the days when the deep, satisfying click of a physical button punctuated the turn of a page, but those days are clearly over and Amazon's PagePress is about as worthy a replacement as we could get. (Don't worry, you can still tap on the screen to change pages.) The whole thing is simple enough: Press the long vertical line on either side of the screen to turn the page, and the dot sitting above it to flip back one. By default, both vibration and sensitivity are set to medium (which is plenty responsive), but you better believe I cranked both options to high in search of a more button-like experience. The end result? It's still not as tactile as a physical button, but it's awfully close. Display and performance There's no two ways about it: The Voyage's screen is downright phenomenal (I fear my pictures don't do it justice). The 6-inch display manages to squeeze in a full 300 pixels per inch, bringing it closer to actual ink on paper than any other E Ink screen I've seen (Kobo's Aura HD has a bigger screen, so the pixel density there doesn't quite match the Voyage). I seriously spent the better part of an afternoon just sort of marveling at it, firing up different books, fiddling with typefaces/font sizes/margins and generally trying to find some arcane combination that made the onscreen text look suboptimal. No dice: This thing is a champ, especially when you consider how awful my eyes are. Traditional e-readers have never been ideal for images, but the Voyage (generally) handles them with gusto. Consider the humble graphic novel: Thumbing through Bryan Lee O'Malley's Seconds wasn't bad at all on the Paperwhite, with lovingly crafted images and text boxes coming through clearly. It wasn't until I put it next to the Voyage that I realized what I was missing -- details that were glossed over on the Paperwhite were easy to spot on the Voyage's high-res display. A menu that appeared smudgy and indistinct on the Paperwhite came through with surprising clarity on the Voyage; I could tell Katie's restaurant was serving \"smoked cornish hen, buttermilk mashed tubers & whipped pork fat and pickled asparagus,\" and that was before I zoomed in. Naturally, digital comic die-hards should invest in a good tablet, but the Voyage is no slouch. Some would argue that trying to cram more pixels into an E Ink screen is overkill. Amazon clearly doesn't buy that argument, and for that I'm very grateful. Surprisingly, the screen feels a little different too, since Amazon chemically etched the surface to reduce glare. That enhanced glass diffuses light well, but the effect isn't as pronounced as I'd hoped -- the Voyage dispenses with glare only slightly more effectively than the Paperwhite does. Doesn't sound great, I know, but I've never had an issue when too much sunlight threw a wrench into my afternoon reading plans. Speaking of lighting, the Voyage has a new trick up its sleeve: It now has an ambient light sensor so it can adjust backlighting level automatically. It works, albeit a little sluggishly, taking a few seconds to adjust to your surroundings. You might think all these lighting tweaks would have some sort of impact on battery life, but the Voyage seems about as efficient as the rest of its kin. Amazon says you'll be able to squeeze about six weeks out of a single charge... assuming you're only reading a half hour a day. My week of testing and reading has been way more rigorous than that, though, and the Voyage is still hanging in there with about 30 percent left. Since an e-reader's display is so intrinsically tied to how well it performs overall, let's dig a little deeper into how the Voyage runs here. Amazon isn't keen on talking about what kind of processor hums away inside that shell, but overall it's plenty snappy... especially compared to the older Paperwhite I had on hand. Turning pages, popping back to the home screen and poring through the Kindle Store on the Voyager were generally way faster than on my 2012 Paperwhite, though the occasional full-screen refresh evened the race sometimes. Interestingly enough, some things -- like turning the screen on and off -- took nearly the same amount of time. If you've never used a touchscreen e-reader, you should know E Ink's natural slowness means you'll need to rethink how you interact with devices like the Voyage. You'll have to resist the temptation to type as fast as you do on a smartphone, for one. It's a tough habit to shake, but you don't have a choice. Let's say you're trying to peck out \"Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World.\" The touchscreen is sensitive enough to register all those taps (you can see the keyboard lighting up as proof), but move too quickly and you'll wind up with gibberish in your search box. And as much as I enjoy those PagePress controls, the rest of the Voyage lets those little guys down a bit; if you're in a rush flipping through pages, you'll notice that not every press/vibration corresponds to a page turn. PagePress aside, these are issues that plague just about all touch-friendly e-readers. We're still a long way off from the e-reading holy grail -- a digital reading experience that's as immediate as thumbing through a real book -- but all things considered, the Voyage is a step in the right direction. Software Amazon went a little nuts with the Voyage's design, but didn't tweak the software nearly as much. All of the old goodies are present and accounted for. There's X-Ray to help you keep tabs on characters and track recurring terms that you press and hold on, not to mention Goodreads integration for you book club types. Vocabulary Builder, meanwhile, compiles all the words you look up in the included dictionary. If you've used a Kindle over the past two years, you'll know exactly what you're getting with the Voyage. The only really notable new feature is what Amazon calls Page Flow: If you swipe from the bottom of the screen while you're in the middle of a book, you'll be able to jump from one chapter to the next or quickly skim through the rest of the text. It sounds like a minor addition, but it's actually pretty great considering the old way involved either popping into the table of contents or randomly punching in a location number and hoping you spot the passage you're looking for. For better or worse, some of the biggest stuff is still in the works. Features like Word Wise (which displays tiny definitions right above tricky words), the ability to skim through a book's images and Kindle library sharing will hit the Voyage, Paperwhite and the new touchscreen basic Kindle later this year. The competition There aren't a ton of players in the high-end e-reader realm, but the Voyage still has a halfway-formidable foe in Kobo's Aura HD. It has a bigger 6.8-inch screen that's only slightly less crisp than the Voyage's (265 ppi vs. 300) and the same 4GB of internal storage. Plus, at $170, it's cheaper, to boot. We were pretty big fans of the HD when it first came out over a year ago, but honestly, the thing hasn't aged well. Everything sounds good on paper, but it's downright chunky compared to the Voyage's light, sleek body. On the bright side, there's at least a microSD slot onboard so you can store every book you'll ever need for the rest of your life. For a great deal of you, though, the Voyage's biggest competitor is its little brother, the Kindle Paperwhite. As modest as its improvements were, last year's tweaked Paperwhite is still one of the best e-readers money can buy, and if you're fine with some mildly obnoxious offers, you can grab one for as low as $119. That's not an insignificant price gulf, and most people who just want to occasionally curl up with some Nabokov won't lose out by hanging onto their cash. Wrap-up After living with the Kindle Voyage for a full week, two undeniable truths become apparent. First, it's the best e-reader you can buy right now. Second, it's also the most expensive, and therein lies the rub. Who exactly does Amazon expect will pay $199 for one of these things? As far as I can tell, the folks in Seattle are gunning for people like me: persnickety purists who want as little compromise as possible. We love books (sometimes to a fault), and we'll stop at nothing until the line between the screens we carry and the tomes we adore is indistinguishable. Here's what it boils down to: If you're an e-reader buff (we exist!) or a bibliophile who yearns for paper in a world that's rapidly leaving it behind, buy the Kindle Voyage.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/24/htc-re-camera-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "November 24th 2014 at 10:00 am", "body": " My father's camcorder was a common sight on childhood vacations. Trips to Mount Rainier, the Oregon Coast, Disneyland, skiing, weddings -- you name it, there's video evidence of my siblings and I enjoying time together. I'm lucky to have grown up in an era where this technology was available, but today these memories can be captured more easily and with less sophisticated (read: less expensive) equipment. We have quick and easy access to cameras at a moment's notice, thanks to smartphones and tablets, and now another form factor is starting to gain momentum: personal cameras. With the exception of the GoPro, this genre is now seeing an influx of small, hand-held devices that are small enough to put in your pocket or bag and can still take decent photos and videos. HTC is one of the companies rushing to get into this space with the RE camera (pronounced \"Ree\"), an awkwardly named gadget that's shaped like a tube, packs a 16-megapixel camera and 1080p HD video capture and features cross-platform support so Android and iOS users alike can take advantage of it. Can this tiny camera take the place of my father's camcorder? What else is it good for? And is it worth paying $200 even if you already have a smartphone camera? Keep Reading to find out. Gallery | 35 Photos HTC RE Camera review + See all 35 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 75 HTC RE Camera Pros Fun to use, inspires creativity Small, lightweight form factor Great for using one-handed Waterproof Can use it without your phone around Cons Camera quality is okay, but not better than most flagships A little pricey No HDR, flash, viewfinder or manual controls iOS app offers subpar user experience So-so battery life Wide-angle shots can look odd Summary The RE is a fun personal camera that's easy to use for travel, concerts, the beach and other events. But its camera is merely average for $200, and you'll be forced to choose between the convenience of the RE and the image quality of your current smartphone. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Warning: If you buy the RE, you will frequently be asked, \"Is that a camera?\" Roaming the hall at Engadget Expand, waiting in line at Six Flags, walking down city streets, attending social events and, well, everywhere, I was approached by people eager to see why I was pointing an upside-down asthma inhaler at things. Its tube-like design makes it easy to grip and an instant icebreaker. No matter how much I like to poke fun at its looks (periscope? A piece of PVC pipe?), HTC had the right idea here: A camera like this has to be small, lightweight and easy to hold. It can't be unwieldy. It needs to be something you want to use often and share with others. HTC's answer is an L-shaped trinket that weighs 66.5 grams (2.35 ounces) and measures 96.7mm in length and 26.5mm in width. It's short enough that it gets obscured in my right hand as I hold it, but long enough that I never feel like it's going to slip out of my grasp. The RE, which comes in white, orange, blue and teal, has a simple design with just two buttons. The shutter button sits near the corner of the device, which feels like a natural fit when I place my thumb there. Pressing this button takes a picture, while holding it down for two seconds prompts the device to start recording video (there's an LED light to indicate when the shutter goes off or when you're recording). The second button, located on the backside, is a toggle allowing you to switch to slow-mo video capture. Farther down, there's an unseen grip sensor that's supposed to detect when you're holding onto the RE so it doesn't snap shots by accident. Meanwhile, another LED shows battery status, and there's a speaker near the bottom, which emits shutter sounds and other signals. Finally, the all-important microphone sits along the top side. The busiest part of the RE is the bottom side. This is where you'll find a 1/4-inch tripod socket for additional accessories, a standard micro-USB charging port and an 8GB microSD card (you can replace it with one as large as 128GB). The camera is powered by an 820mAh battery and comes with a waterproof rating of IP57, which ensures that your device will be safe in a meter of water for up to 30 minutes. HTC will offer a protection pack (sold separately) that increases the rating to IP58 and keeps the RE safe in three meters of water for 120 minutes. A company spokesperson also confirmed that the RE can handle exposure to sand and seawater, though you should still be careful, as it's not indestructible. The RE also has a gyroscope that can detect when the device is upside down, so it'll automatically flip the resulting images so they're facing right side up. Of course, you can also turn off that setting in case you actually want to capture footage this way. Plenty of accessories abound for the RE. In addition to the aforementioned protection pack, HTC offers bike mounts, suction cups, external battery packs and a pyramid-like charging stand. Software (Image credit: Daniel Bader) HTC has lately been trying to expand its brand beyond hardware, and so it's working on creating cross-platform services, like the Zoe app, that work on both Android (4.3+) and iOS (7+) devices. The RE is no different: It's not restricted to HTC-made devices, so as long as you're using either Android or iOS, you'll be able to purchase the camera and download the companion app. In the case of the RE, the software isn't absolutely essential, per se. The camera's capable of storing photos and videos locally on a microSD card, so you could technically use it without ever connecting it to a smartphone -- just plug the device or the card into your computer and transfer the files directly. However, forsaking the smartphone app means you'll be missing out on a few key features, like a real-time viewfinder, remote shutter key and time-lapse video, as well as the ability to update the camera's firmware easily (there's a way to sideload the file onto the SD card, but it's more complicated). The latter option is arguably the most critical, especially as HTC rolls out bug fixes, performance improvements and new features over the device's lifetime. So while it's technically possible to use the RE as a standalone camera, I'd advise against it. Even so, it's good to know you can take the RE with you anywhere and not have to always be tethered to your phone at the same time. The UI is nearly the same on both the Android and iOS versions. After you connect the device, which involves pairing using Bluetooth Low Energy, you'll be presented with a viewfinder and three remote shutter options: stills, videos and time-lapse. This makes it much easier to frame the kind of shot you want, if you don't want to do the point-and-pray approach. Near the top, you can access the camera roll, which consists of all the images currently stored on the microSD card. You can back all of them up to your phone (every time you go into the app and connect the RE) or pick and choose specific ones, depending on how much space you have; there's also the option to upload all of your stuff to Dropbox or Google Drive anytime you're connected to a WiFi network. There are plenty of other niceties in the settings menu. Here you can toggle ultra-wide-angle mode, change camera resolution, soften or turn off the shutter sound volume and, finally, power off your device (that's important, since there's no other way to do it besides letting the battery die). Speaking of the sound, by the way, I recommend leaving it on because the LED indicator isn't always easy to see. There's also the creep factor to consider. Gallery | 26 Photos HTC RE app screens + See all 26 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Although the interface is roughly the same on both platforms, the user experience is better on the Android app. The RE uses WiFi Direct to transfer photos and videos to the phone, and while both mobile OSes support the tech, iOS handles it a little differently. Each time you want to connect to the RE, the app will ask you to go into your WiFi settings and connect to the RE's ad hoc network. Once that link is established, you're good to go -- at least, until you exit the app or become idle for longer than three minutes. This is a huge interruption and takes up a lot of extra time, and if you're trying to frame a shot in a hurry, it's an inadequate solution. The Android app, on the other hand, establishes a connection with the RE in-app while maintaining your phone's existing WiFi link. It's a much more seamless experience. One other thing: If you try to watch a RE video on the app without downloading it to the phone first, it's almost impossible to get through more than 10 seconds without the stream either hiccuping or just completely stopping. Sometimes the video will stop while the audio plays on. If HTC can't get this right, I'm not sure how it plans to make its upcoming Live Broadcast to YouTube feature (which the company says is coming at a later date) a seamless experience for viewers. Use cases Unless you have plenty of money burning your pockets, $200 for a personal camera can be difficult to justify, especially since most of us already have a perfectly capable camera phone, and maybe even a tablet too. We've already mastered the perfect selfies, and phone makers have done an excellent job at shortening the time it takes to pull out our devices and start snapping. So why bother trying to juggle yet another device? It's a valid argument, and indeed, I was skeptical about the RE's usefulness before I played with one. Now I totally understand why it makes sense... in certain situations, at least. For one thing, it's just fun to use. It's a fantastic social tool; I handed it to friends, co-workers and family members to see what they would do with it (answer: take a lot of close-ups of their eyes, nose and other body parts). We'd take selfies together and find other ways to use it to pass the time. Also, with the RE in-hand, I discovered I was taking more pictures than ever before. It's ridiculous how quickly I reached my 600th shot. I took several times more images on the RE than I usually do on smartphones. Suddenly, I found myself looking for ways to come up with creative new photo opportunities and even took pictures of things that weren't all that interesting -- you know, just in case I needed the shots for my next great masterpiece. I tried different angles; I raised the RE far above my head to catch a new perspective on something cute my kids were doing; I even took it on a roller coaster and filmed my rides (only try this if you're confident in your grip). It reminded me of the first time I used a digital camera instead of film: I had an epiphany that I could take as many pictures as I wanted to and just discard the bad ones. The only limitation was the size of my external storage card. It was as if a huge burden had been lifted off of my shoulders. Now in 2014, I get a similar feeling from the RE. The camera is also easy to use one-handed, so I could take a picture of my daughter as she and I walked in the rain under umbrellas; without the RE, it would've been a struggle to take my phone out of my pocket, get into camera mode and then take the picture, all with only one hand. The biggest exception to this rule is the shake feature on the Moto X, but it's still a few seconds faster to pull out the RE and press the button. Had it been warmer, too, I would have jumped into a pool with the RE or used it at the beach. It's a lot handier to carry this petite camera than a bulky phone, so you can take pictures and videos of what's happening without worrying about getting your handset wet or full of sand. And since you're less tempted to look at your phone, chances are you're a lot less distracted. Which brings me to my next point. It's not difficult to take pictures with my phone, but it also involves more fiddling around with the app, tweaking settings, making sure the focus is just right and other tasks. Say what you will about not having a viewfinder on the RE, but it's one less distraction keeping you from being focused on what's really important: the actual thing you're seeing with your own eyes. It's easier to focus on what you're capturing, rather than the process of capturing it. After all, I can't enjoy my child's recital as much when I'm hiding behind a screen. Is there a chance my pictures and videos end up off-center? Sure, but the more I used the RE, the more I understood what its boundaries and limitations were, so I developed a sense of how to take better photos. The RE is great for vacations and travel, hiking and camping, concerts (for video, at least), the beach and any impromptu moment that comes and goes in a matter of seconds -- y'know, the cheesy stuff you see in commercials. In my preview, I called the RE \"the GoPro for NoPros,\" and the nickname still rings true. But this is all contingent upon actually having the device handy, which is easier said than done. If it's in your backpack or purse, you'll likely spend countless seconds trying to dig it out. It's also small enough that you'll accidentally leave it at home or in the car on several occasions (this happened to me a few times). In the most ideal situation, which involves me having it in-hand or at least in my pocket ready for a quick draw, it's a huge timesaver; for every other moment in which it's not, you'll probably default to grabbing your phone. Performance The RE takes 16-megapixel still photos with a 4:3 aspect ratio, though you can drop the resolution down to 12MP if you prefer to shoot in 16:9. Videos max out at 1080p/30 fps, though slow-motion capture comes in at 720p. Thus, images taken with the RE pack the same number of pixels as the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S5, but it lacks UHD video capture, which is quickly becoming a standard on flagship smartphones. Of course, just because the RE has the same resolution as high-end handsets doesn't mean they're going to be of the same quality. There are a few key factors that make the RE different. The RE's aperture is much smaller at f/2.8, making it more difficult to use in low-light scenarios; default images use a 100-degree wide-angle shot, increasing to 146 degrees on ultra-wide photos (videos are 86 degrees); and there's no autofocus, manual settings or HDR to enhance your images in any way. So how much of an impact do these factors have? You know how car mirrors say objects are closer than they appear\"? The wide-angle lens on the RE makes some images turn out exactly the same way; the stuff I shot wound up looking more distant than they really were. In addition, distortion is easy spottable on the outer edges of most photos: Street poles look curved (#bendgate2); people get stretched; and so on. Thus, you'll get images taken from an entirely different perspective than you normally would get on a smartphone camera. It makes for some really creative shots, but keep the wide-angle aspect in mind when you're trying to set up the perfect selfie. And even if you think you're close enough to the photo's subject (and aren't looking at the remote viewfinder), you may want to inch a little closer just in case. The kicker is that while it's good to get closer, you don't wanna get too close. When I tried to take close-up shots of anything, the object would appear slightly blurry, while everything farther away remained in focus. Figuring out how to frame your shots on this device is a learned skill, but over time, you'll get better as you discover the best angles and distances for each type of situation. Of the roughly 600 photos I took during the course of my review, at least 15 percent of my camera roll consisted of blurry, unusable shots that looked like I'd been shaking the device when the shutter went off. One of the primary culprits here is shutter lag. From a cold start (if you haven't taken pictures in a little while), it takes around two seconds for the RE to fire off a shot. Most of the time, I forgot to stay perfectly still; the idea of this camera is to shoot something quickly and move on to the next thing, so when I would go out for a walk, I would tend to press the button and keep walking. As a result, quite a few of my photos were taken as I was dropping my arms. Eventually I got in the habit of taking two shots, since the second shot's shutter delay is much shorter -- just a half a second or so. About 15 to 20 pictures in my camera roll were taken in my pocket. This was unexpected, since the RE comes with a sensor that detects when you're holding it and disables the button when you're not. Thus, there's a small chance that if you place it in the bottom of a purse next to several other small items that tend to shift around, you may find random images of nothing in particular. On one occasion, the RE dropped onto the floor of my car and presto -- I now have a prized picture showing what's underneath the back seat. (Let's just say there's a reason I left that image out of the photo gallery.) Gallery | 59 Photos HTC RE sample shots + See all 59 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") In direct sunlight on a clear day, the RE's exposure seems a little too high. The sun bleaches out the blue sky that typically shows up rich and deep on flagship phone cameras, and a lot of fine details are lost. Colors also often appear undersaturated. And given its relatively small aperture, it's no surprise that lowlight shots were disappointing; I wasn't able to capture as much light as many phone cameras. Even the few images that showed up reasonably well still suffered from a lot of noise. It was difficult to get in-focus pictures when I snapped shots of moving objects (especially evident in concerts and late-night dinners). In other words, the RE may work in a pinch, but don't rely on this camera when there's very little light to take advantage of. (To see my full-res images, visit my Flickr page. I left in many of the blurry shots so you can get an idea of how easy it is to take them.) Slow-motion video capture was smooth enough, but its 720p resolution took even more of a toll than I had initially expected. Most of my footage was so grainy that it didn't look anywhere close to HD quality. Again, it's great for goofing around, but it needs some improvements. There's also no way to change the speeds either; it shouldn't be difficult for HTC to add this feature to the settings menu, but the company is keeping it at 4x speed for now. The max video capture resolution is 1080p/30fps, but you can also use 720p/30fps if you're trying to save space. At 1080p, the footage provides an overall bit rate of 17.8 Mbps, and the device comes with a video-stabilization feature that offers slightly smoother results when it's turned on. This is especially important when you're filming with the RE in-hand, because most hands are going to be at least a little shaky. (My hands can be pretty unsteady, but most of my videos still turned out smoother than I expected.) The device captures audio surprisingly well; I used the RE at a concert and the music came out clear and easy to hear. I was expecting the sound to be muffled and unusable in such a loud venue, so I was quite happy with how well it turned out. (If you want to actually see the band in your video, however, you'll want to be close to the stage because the RE has no zoom function.) #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-104263{display:none;} .cke_show_borders #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-104263, #postcontentcontainer #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-104263{width:630px;display:block;} try{document.getElementById(\"fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-104263\").style.display=\"none\";}catch(e){} Battery life The other key element of the RE's performance is its battery life. It's designed to be portable and handy enough for you to take everywhere you go, but what good is it going to do you if it dies halfway through the day? As with phones, mileage will vary greatly depending on how much you're using it. It could last for days on standby if you're never taking pictures or establishing a connection to your phone, but it doesn't last so long when you're snapping a whole bunch of shots of your family while on vacation. On a recent trip to Six Flags, I took photos and videos of as many things as I could think of, and got 4.5 hours of runtime before the RE needed a recharge. HTC claims it gets roughly an hour and 50 minutes of continuous video capture, and my own results didn't veer too far from that; my unit died after an hour and 35 minutes. And although I didn't test out HTC's estimate that you can take 1,200 photos in one charge, I spent an entire day at Engadget Expand taking a total of 110 images, 15 videos and 10 slow-motion videos before it powered off -- a healthy mix, to be sure, but if you plan to use the RE a lot in one day, you'll want to get the optional extended battery pack. Wrap-up The RE isn't the only personal camera on the market, but it's the handiest to use. For $100 you can get the Polaroid Cube, a small cube-like device with a 6MP camera, 1080p video capture and magnets for attaching to metal objects. However, it's not very comfortable or easy to hold for long periods of time. There's also the flagship GoPro Hero series, which is primarily an action camera catered to athletes, filmmakers and other professionals that starts at $200 (the Hero4, which comes with a 12MP camera and 4K video resolution, goes for $400+; there's also a lower-end Hero model with 5MP and 720p max res at $130). The RE, on the other hand, is $200 and is meant to be used by the everyday consumer -- parents, travelers and anyone else interested in documenting their life. In fact, HTC doesn't even look at GoPro as a direct competitor for that reason. On paper, the RE's price isn't so ridiculous. It seems to fit right in-between the Cube and GoPro, but HTC's target market won't be as easily convinced. It's geared toward the average Joe, who will likely scoff at the $200 price tag because he has a phone camera that can do a lot of the same stuff. It comes down to the value of convenience over image quality and cost: The RE is great in a pinch and takes plenty of good shots, but most of your images won't be better than on many flagship and mid-range phones. So anytime you want to fire off a quick picture, you'll find yourself deciding between the speed and ease of use of the RE and the better quality of your smartphone. It's a tough sell for most, but I did find the RE quite enjoyable to use. It encouraged me to be more creative with my photography, and I took a lot of images of things I wouldn't have otherwise. There's a lot of potential with this form factor, and with a lower price and improvements to the image quality, the camera could be very successful. But until then, it's simply a first-generation product with some cool use cases that just happens to be a little rough around the edges. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android, htc, HTC RE, htcre, ios, mobilepostcross, personalcamera, RE, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20995731 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20995731\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/htc/re/\"> HTC RE </a> HTC RE Buy from $139 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/htc/re/\" title=\"HTC RE reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 0 </a> Prices Discussions Type Consumer Form factor Handheld Media type Memory card Recording time 40 mins Sensor type CMOS Dimensions 3.81 x 1.04 in Weight 2.31 oz Announced 2014-10-08 see all specs \u2192 There are not any reviews for this product yet.

But times have changed, and as people began to order their books online -- or even download them -- B&N found itself struggling to keep up. After losing a lot of money last year, the company decided it was time for a change: It vowed to stop making its own tablets, and instead team up with some third-party company to better take on Amazon and its Kindle Fire line. Turns out, that third party was none other than Samsung, and the fruits of their partnership, the $179 Galaxy Tab 4 Nook, is basically a repackaged version of the existing Galaxy Tab 4 7.0. Well, almost, anyway. The 7-inch slate comes pre-loaded with $200 worth of free content, and the core Nook app has been redesigned to the point that it actually offers a better reading experience than the regular Nook Android app. But is that a good enough reason to buy this instead of a Kindle Fire? Or any other Android tablet, for that matter? Gallery | 14 Photos Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook review + See all 14 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 70 Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook Pros Good-looking design Bright screen The Nook app here is an improvement over the regular Nook for Android Price includes some free books, magazines and TV shows Cons Short battery life compared to competing devices Sluggish performance Skimpy built-in storage Summary With an improved reading app, the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook could be a compelling choice for loyal Barnes & Noble customers. But if all you want is a budget Android tablet, you can do better, even at this price. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware As you've already gathered, this is the same hardware you'll find on the 7-inch Galaxy Tab 4, which came out four months ago. Since we never got around to reviewing that, though, I'll do a thorough walk-through here as if it were a brand-new device. What's funny is that depending on how you look at it, you actually have seen this tablet before: The Nook (available in black and white) has the same textured plastic backing as other recent Samsung devices. As I've said about other products, like the Chromebook 2, the leathery plastic and chrome accents go a long way in making an otherwise generic device look more expensive than it is. As a bonus, the textured plastic doesn't pick up fingerprints, and it's pretty scratch-resistant, too. During my testing, I routinely tossed the tablet in a bag with pointy items like pens and keys, and it never emerged worse for wear. The Galaxy Tab 4 Nook is a 7-inch device, so of course it's small, lightweight and easy to hold. At 0.35 inch thick, it's a little chubby compared to other small-screen slates, like the 8-inch Galaxy Tab S. Even so, it weighs just 0.6 pound, so let's not nitpick to the point where we're calling this thing \"heavy.\" It's not. And besides, you might even find that those wide, flat edges make the tablet easier to hold. For a budget device, the screen is actually quite lovely. Sure, the 1,280 x 800 resolution translates to a not-so-great pixel density of 216 ppi, but then again, what more did you expect on a $179 tablet? For the money, you get a bright panel with good viewing angles that's well-suited for reading and movie-watching. Even at half-brightness, I had no problems using it on a long rail trip, with daylight streaming in through the window next to me. Flip the device around and you'll find the usual spate of ports: a headphone jack up top, a micro-USB charging socket on the bottom, a speaker and 3-megapixel camera around back and a 1.3MP one up front. The right edge, meanwhile, is home to a volume rocker, power button and IR blaster -- a fairly uncommon feature on a budget tablet. Nearby, you'll also find a microSD slot supporting cards up to 32GB. It's a shame, that -- you'll need every last bit of storage space to augment the device's skimpy 8GB of built-in memory, only 2GB of which is user-accessible. Software The way Samsung and Barnes & Noble pitched the device, this is Samsung hardware mixed with B&N's Nook software. That's a little misleading: This is a Samsung tablet, with Samsung's user interface, but with some Nook apps sprinkled in, too. What we have here is the same TouchWiz experience -- everything from the icons to the onscreen keyboard to the settings menu is the same as on other Samsung tablets. Likewise, there's Samsung's signature Multi Window feature, allowing you to view two apps side by side. It even has Google Play access, so you can download all the apps you'd install on any other Android device -- yes, including Amazon Kindle. What's nice, though, is that unlike other Samsung tablets, this one doesn't include Sammy's intrusive My Magazine -- big panels that sit to the left of the home screen and can't be removed. I don't really like the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook, as you'll see, but I do wish other Samsung products had this scaled-back UI. Other than that, the biggest difference is that Sammy pre-loaded the Nook tablet with some key Barnes & Noble applications, including Nook Apps, Nook Library, Nook Search, Nook Settings, Nook Shop, Nook Today (a personalized recommendation engine) and Nook Highlights (useful if you choose to underline stuff as you're reading). You'll also find (removable) widgets for your library and the Nook Store -- in fact, both were waiting for me on the home screen when I booted up the device. Additionally, Samsung and Barnes & Noble tossed in some free content -- a motley collection of books, magazines, movies and TV shows said to be worth $200. There's something for everyone here; the flip side is that much of it will probably register as junk. On your bookshelf, To Kill a Mockingbird sits alongside a Danielle Steel romance and the kid's title Pete the Cat. For film and TV, there's the pilot episode of Veep, among other shows, as well as The Lego Movie. (Fortunately, the Nook has a parental control feature allowing for different user profiles.) If it's magazines you're after, you have a choice of three: Us Weekly, National Geographic and Sports Illustrated. Finally, you'll get $5 in Nook Store credit. It's a nice gesture, but it won't go far: Five bucks isn't enough to buy most e-books in B&N's catalog. Again, I'm sure the two companies meant well, but if it were a choice between extra content and a tablet with faster performance and longer battery life, I'd choose the latter in a heartbeat. Gallery | 34 Photos Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook screenshots + See all 34 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") What's surprised me is that this is not a copy-and-paste of the regular Nook for Android app. Whereas the Nook application on my Moto X combines the library, search and store functions into one place, the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook contains different apps for all those things. Whichever you use, the core functionality is the same: In addition to reading content, you can access the store, highlight passages and rate/review stuff. But here, the icons are different, and you don't always have to drill as far into menus to get what you want (see: font options, search, table of contents). Highlighting text is also easier in the Samsung app than the regular Android one. If anything, the UI feels more similar to Barnes & Noble's e-ink e-readers, which is funny because that would seem to be an entirely different class of product. Certainly, this is a more pleasant Nook experience than what you'd get on other Android devices. Something to keep in mind if you're already a loyal Barnes & Noble customer. Beside the various Nook apps, Samsung installed a few other third-party programs as well, including Dropbox, Hancom Office 2014, Netflix, OfficeSuite 7 (the more robust of the two office programs here) and the game Rayman Jungle Run. You'll also find a shortcut to Samsung's own curated app store -- you know, should Google Play not be enough. Obviously, this is a bit of a mixed bag, but to each his own. You can at least uninstall anything that doesn't suit you.

I only saw the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook for the first time last week, but already I've heard Barnes & Noble reps say several times that the tablet is built for reading. To some extent, they're just stating the obvious: Samsung and Barnes & Noble built a tablet together, and it's supposed to offer a great reading experience, because that's what B&N is good at. Duh. But I also suspect the two companies have been trying to keep our expectations in check. Even for a budget tablet, this thing is kinda slow, and I think Samsung and Barnes & Noble both know it. Under the hood, it has the same internals as the regular Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 -- a 1.2GHz quad-core Marvell PXA 1088 processor and 1.5GB of RAM, a combination that sorely trails the competition in benchmark tests. The results were so bad, in fact, that I thought at first the numbers might be flukes. Indeed, I ran the tests many, many times, and the results were always far below other tablets, even the similarly priced ASUS MeMO Pad 7, last year's Nexus 7 and the 7-inch Amazon Fire HDX. That sluggishness rears its head in real-word use, too. The accelerometer was often slow to catch up as I flipped the device from portrait to landscape mode and back. Web browsing is smooth enough, though the benchmarks suggest you'd have an even snappier experience on competing devices. Cold-booting the device takes a long 24 seconds, forcing you to wait through animated splash screens for both Samsung and Nook. Multi Window mode works, but it can take a second or two for a new app to load if you decide to replace one of the two panes. Even the Nook library -- the app that matters most -- was often slow to load up my bookshelf. Like other Samsung devices, the Nook was initially slow to minimize apps when I pressed the home button. Luckily, there's a solution, and it actually has to do with S Voice, of all things: Just go into S Voice settings and uncheck the box \"open via the home key.\" That way, when you press the home button, the device won't wait to see if you'll do a double-press to launch the voice assistant. With that issue, at least, I was able to improve the performance. The problem, too, is that for the folks buying this, the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook isn't just for reading. If it were, they'd get a standalone e-reader and call it a day. But if you're going to get an Android tablet, particularly one with multi-window support and access to the Google Play store, you probably want to do more than just read e-books. You want to download apps. Stream movies. Browse the web. Maybe play the occasional game. The Galaxy Tab 4 Nook can do most of that, but not always smoothly. Another device -- even a competing budget tablet -- will probably feel faster. Tablet Battery Life Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 7:34 Microsoft Surface 2 14:22 (LTE) Apple iPad Air 13:45 (LTE) Samsung Galaxy Tab S (10-inch) 12:30 Samsung Galaxy Tab S (8-inch) 12:22 Apple iPad mini with Retina display 11:55 (LTE) Amazon Kindle Fire HDX (7-inch) 10:41 (WiFi) Nexus 7 (2012) 9:49 ASUS MeMO Pad 8 9:21 Kindle Fire HD (8.9-inch) 9:01 ASUS MeMO Pad 7 8:36 NVIDIA Shield tablet 8:23 Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet (2012) 7:57 Nexus 7 (2013) 7:15 Samsung says the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook's battery can last up to 10 hours. With light usage, that might well be true. But in our (admittedly taxing) video rundown test, the battery died out a few hours sooner. All in all, the tablet was able to last through about seven and a half hours of looping a 1080p video at fixed brightness, with social networks periodically refreshing in the background. Again, your mileage will vary, but it's worth noting that other devices can do better. ASUS' MeMO Pad 7 also got about an hour more than the Nook. Meanwhile, the 7-inch Amazon Kindle Fire HDX managed nearly 11 hours in the same grueling test. Even the 2013 Nexus 7 gets about the same runtime as the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook -- and the performance is slightly better, too. The competition When the original Nook Tablet came out, it was easy to forgive some of its shortcomings, just because the price was fairly low. At the time, $249 was cheap for an Android tablet, especially when flagships routinely sold for $500 and up. This is a different time, though, and while $170 isn't bad for this new Nook device, it also faces stiffer competition. The ASUS MeMO Pad 7, for instance, has a lower price of $150, complete with an IPS display, double the internal storage, longer battery life, a microSDXC slot supporting higher-capacity cards and a quad-core processor that creams the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook in benchmarks. Meanwhile, Dell sells the $160 Venue 7, which has a 1,280 x 800 IPS screen and a higher-resolution 5MP rear camera. (I haven't tested that, so I can't vouch for the performance.) Finally, it comes with 16GB of storage, and can accommodate memory cards as large as 64GB. It goes without saying, too, that any Android tablet is capable of running the standard Nook app. So far as I can tell, then, the one thing the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook has going for it is Multi Window support, but what good is that if the processor is too weak to handle it? If you're willing to spend more, the 7-inch Amazon Kindle Fire HDX starts at $229 with 16GB of storage ($244 without ads on the lock screen). For the money, almost everything is better: The battery life is several hours longer, and the performance is stronger, thanks to a fairly up-to-date Snapdragon 800 processor and 2GB of RAM. The screen is sharper too, with 1,920 x 1,200 resolution and a tight pixel density of 323 ppi. You won't get Google Play access, unfortunately, but Amazon's own app store has grown steadily over the years, and its digital content selection is just as diverse as Barnes & Noble's. Amazon even basically matches B&N on technical support: Whereas Barnes & Noble offers lifetime in-store service for its Nook tablets, Amazon's built-in \"Mayday\" feature lets you access live help anytime. Other than the fact that Amazon's tablet costs $50 more, it's hard to say why you'd get the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook instead. Because even if having access to Google Play is important to you, you'd still be better off with last year's Nexus 7. It costs $229, just like the Kindle Fire HDX, and it too has a 1,920 x 1,200 screen. The performance won't be quite as brisk as the HDX, but it should still be snappier than the new Nook tablet. The battery life is similar to the Nook as well, so you're not giving up anything in the way of endurance. Wrap-up This should come as a shock to no one, but the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook is only a good idea if you're already a loyal Barnes & Noble customer. Setting aside the fact that it comes with free content (a gimmick, if you ask me), this tablet is appealing because it offers a better reading experience than even the regular Nook for Android app. Until Barnes & Noble redesigns its standard Android application, this is the best Nook experience you're going to get, short of buying one of B&N's standalone, e-ink e-readers. Even then, that's a stretch: It's not like the regular Nook app is so bad that you shouldn't consider other Android tablets. If you're not even a Nook customer, then there's definitely no reason to buy this. Sure, the design is nice, and the screen is bright, but the battery life is short compared to competing devices, and the performance is slower. Adding insult to injury, you get less built-in storage for apps, books, photos and music, and the microSD slot doesn't officially support cards larger than 32GB. For people who just want a budget Android tab, and don't care where they buy their books, you can do better, even for $179. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: barnes and noble, BarnesAndNoble, galaxy tab 4, Galaxy Tab 4 Nook, galaxytab4, galaxytab4nook, mobilepostcross, Nook, review, samsung, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20951054 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20951054\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/tab4/7-0/\"> Samsung Galaxy Tab4 7.0 </a> Samsung Galaxy Tab4 7.0 8GB 16GB Buy from $165 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/tab4/7-0/\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy Tab4 7.0 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 2 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Tablet Operating system Android (KitKat [4.4]) Screen size 7 inches Storage type Internal storage (8 GB, Flash), Memory card Camera (integrated) 3\u00a0megapixels Dimensions 7.36 x 4.25 x 0.35 in Weight 9.74 oz Announced 2014-04-01 see all specs \u2192 7.5average user rating Features 7 Display 6 Battery life 10 Ease of use 9 Storage capacity 8 Design and form factor 8 Portability (size / weight) 9 Durability 8 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 Displaying prices for model: 8GB-Black 8GB-White $165.00 + tax & shipping Buy now $177.99 + tax & shipping Buy now $177.99 + tax & shipping Buy now $177.99 + tax & shipping Buy now 8 I'm testing the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook: What do you want to know? 0 Samsung Galaxy Tab2 7.0 Talk about the Samsung Galaxy Tab4 7.0 with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/tab/4-nook/\"> Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 NOOK </a> Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 NOOK 10.1 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/tab/4-nook/\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 NOOK reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Tablet Operating system Android Screen size 7 inches Storage type Internal storage (8 GB, Flash), Memory card Maximum battery life Up to 10 hours Dimensions 7.36 x 4.25 x 0.35 in Weight 9.74 oz Announced 2014-08-20 see all specs \u2192 5average user rating Features 8 Display 8 Battery life 6 Ease of use 4 Storage capacity 2 Design and form factor 8 Portability (size / weight) 8 Durability 8 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 8 I'm testing the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook: What do you want to know? 1 gps? voice activated?

No fun, right? Right. Except if you're a tech writer. Now that most major companies have revealed their new lineups, we have the exciting job of testing all this stuff; seeing how it holds up in real life. The first product of the year to cross my desk: none other than the Dell XPS 13, a compact 13-inch laptop that ranked as a finalist for our annual Best of CES awards. In addition to being the first system we've tested with Intel's new fifth-generation Core processor, the redesigned XPS is notable for its nearly bezel-less display -- a design feat that allows it to have the footprint of an 11-inch machine. Particularly with a starting price of $800 (pretty reasonable for a flagship laptop), it seemed poised to become one of our new favorite Ultrabooks. And you know what? It actually is.

To be fair, of course, I'm a little late to the game: Netbooks and 11-inch laptops have been around for years, but until now, I've avoided them precisely because I prefer the extra screen real estate. That said, with a display this big, the XPS 13 feels like the best of both worlds. Especially for frequent travelers like me. Take my recent cross-country flight to Seattle. The laptop took up less space in my backpack than my MacBook Air would have. It was easier to balance on a cramped airplane tray, even with the person in front of me leaning all the way back (thanks, dude). And for those moments when I had to put my laptop out of sight, it was small enough that I could stow it inside the seat-back compartment with room to spare. At the same time, I had enough space to juggle multiple browser tabs, as well as WordPad in a separate window. After a week with the XPS 13, I'm reminded that weight and thinness aren't everything, though it definitely helps that this thing starts at just 2.6 pounds. Not bad for a 13-inch laptop! (Even with the optional touchscreen, it's still 2.8 pounds.) Other than the smaller footprint and nearly bezeless screen, the XPS 13 hews to the same design language as Dell's previous Ultrabooks. Which is to say, it features a smooth metal exterior, with details that include a metal plate on the bottom side to cover up all the required FCC fine print. On the inside, a soft carbon fiber finish stretches across the keyboard deck all the way from the hinge to the palm rest. It's a design that's both beautiful and practical, and I'm glad Dell didn't mess with a good thing just for the sake of shaking things up. For one thing, the carbon weave is nice to look at. Disagree with me if you like, but I think it instantly makes this $800 machine look more expensive than it actually is. It feels nice too, especially if you have the laptop on a flat surface and are letting your wrists hang off the palm rest. Also, thanks to that weave pattern, scratches are virtually a non-issue. Fingerprints too. (The keyboard is another story: I've got a big grease stain on the space bar, where my thumb keeps hitting it.) Speaking of the keyboard, I really like it, even if it does require a bit of upkeep to keep the fingerprints away. Despite the XPS 13's compact footprint, this feels like a full-sized layout. Though there are a few shrunken buttons (backspace, for example), most of the backlit keys feel generously sized and well-spaced. Even the arrow keys are easy to find by feel, and those are usually the first things to get squeezed when space is an issue. The buttons also have a surprising amount of travel compared to some other Ultrabooks, with a springiness that made it easy for me to type at a fast clip. My only quibble is that the keyboard sometimes failed to register my button presses, forcing me to go back and re-type stuff. To be honest, though, this is an issue on many Ultrabooks; in fact, it's probably less of a problem here, what with those relatively cushy buttons. I won't go so far as to say I hate the Microsoft-made Precision touchpad, but it's definitely not as well-engineered as the keyboard. There's just a little too much friction, to the point where I noticed some stuttering even while doing basic two-finger scrolling (that's not just in IE, but in apps like File Explorer and WordPad too). Pinch-to-zoom also didn't feel as controlled as on some other Windows PCs; it sometimes took me multiple attempts to scale text exactly the way I wanted. One time, I actually zoomed in on a webpage by accident when all I meant to do was scroll through. On the bright side, the trackpad does well at single-finger tracking -- an area where other laptop touchpads frequently fall short. Though it's a smaller-than-average machine, the XPS 13 thankfully still includes all the usual ports. Well, most of them anyway. Over on the left side, we have a Mini DisplayPort, a headphone jack, one of two USB 3.0 connections and the all-important power socket. The right edge is less crowded, with a Kensington lock slot, a full-sized SD card reader and that second USB opening. There's also an HD webcam, nestled in the lower-left corner below the screen (clearly, Dell had to get creative to accommodate those skinny bezels). Really, of all the things you might reasonably expect to find on an Ultrabook, the only thing missing is an HDMI port. Even then, I suspect many of you will do just fine without it. I know I have. Display and sound Dell's marketing team has taken the liberty of calling the XPS 13's screen an \"infinity display.\" While that's technically incorrect -- you can still make out the 5.2mm-thick bezels on either side -- this is perhaps the closest thing I've seen to a true edge-to-edge display, with pixels stretching all the way across. Also, the screen here has the tiniest bumper you ever did see, which also helps create the illusion of uninterrupted glass. In any case, it's all very pretty, as you'd expect, and it's practical too: You get the same real estate as any other 13-inch laptop, just with a smaller footprint. Dell didn't skimp on the display quality either. The IPS Gorilla Glass screen (which starts at 1080p resolution, but goes up to 3,200 x 1,800) offers wide viewing angles, which came in handy during my six-hour flight from New York to Seattle. Even with the window open and sunlight pouring in, I could still make out the screen without issue. Also, given that I was trapped in economy, I didn't exactly have much space to work with. Still, whether I had the machine in my lap or balanced on the tray table with the lid dipped forward, I enjoyed bright colors and even contrasts. No washouts here. My only complaint? The XPS 13 doesn't come standard with a touchscreen; for that feature, you'll need to pay $1,300, not $800. Boo. It's easy to miss the XPS 13's stereo speakers the first time you pick it up: They're nestled on either side of the laptop, toward the front where the chassis gets really narrow. While the audio might seem like an afterthought, it's actually surprisingly good -- among the best in its class, even. The volume is strong enough that I typically didn't need to push it much beyond the 30 out of 100 mark. And while this isn't the most bass-heavy setup you've ever heard (why would it be?), the speakers stand up well to a wide variety of musical genres, from classical to jazz to hip-hop and pop. All told, even when I needed to go back to my \"real\" laptop for certain things, I continued to use the XPS 13 as my music machine.

Its gorgeous display. The fact that it nearly won a Best of CES Award. In addition to all that, though, this is my first opportunity to test a PC running one of Intel's new \"Broadwell\" chips. For the uninitiated, Intel's fifth-generation Core CPUs have the same basic architecture as last year's processors, except they've been shrunken down from a 22nm process to a 14nm one. Given that the chip design is generally the same, then, you should expect some fairly modest performance improvements. For instance, Intel is touting just a 4 percent boost in productivity tasks, as measured by the test SysMark. The company has also said battery life could be up to an hour and a half longer than on last year's \"Haswell\" machines, but even that's just a best-case scenario. If anything, Broadwell has the most promise on the graphics front. Even before Broadwell PCs started hitting the market, Intel claimed that its new chips performed 22 percent better than last year's models in 3D graphics benchmarks. Indeed, about two-thirds of the die area on these chips is dedicated to graphics. Sure enough, with a dual-core 2.2GHz Core i5-5200U CPU and 8GB of RAM (a configuration worth $1,300), I saw huge gains in every test I ran -- just look at the comparison table above if you don't believe me. By the same measure, general performance, as measured by PCMark, was only slightly improved over machines running last year's processors. Its 10-second boot-up is also par for the course. Although my particular test unit included a 128GB solid-state drive from LiteOn, a Dell spokesperson told me that some machines will instead make use of a fast new Samsung drive that claims up to 2.15 GB/s read and 1.55 GB/s write speeds, all while sipping just two milliwatts of standby power. While I was a little disappointed not to find that listed in my machine's Device Manager, I still enjoyed some fast disk speeds, with up to 515 MB/s reads and 455 MB/s writes. That last figure -- the write rate -- is especially impressive: Though many laptops can get into 500 MB/s territory for read speeds, most top out in the mid-200 MB/s range on writes. So, Samsung or no Samsung, you should enjoy some better-than-average performance here, at least as far as disk speeds are concerned. Battery life Dell XPS 13 (2015) 7:36 MacBook Air (13-inch, 2013) 12:51 MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2013) 11:18 Samsung ATIV Book 9 (2014 Edition) 9:48 Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus 8:44 HP Spectre 13 8:30 Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro 7:36 Acer Aspire S7-392 7:33 Samsung Series 9 (15-inch, 2012) 7:29 Microsoft Surface Pro 3 7:08 Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro 6:32 Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2014) 6:18 Depending on your usage patterns, Dell says you can get up to 15 hours of battery life with a full HD display, and up to 11 hours with a 3,200 x 1,800 touch panel. On my test unit, which had a 3,200 x 1,800 touchscreen, I got an average of seven hours and 36 minutes in our standard video-looping test, though I bet I could have squeezed out even more runtime had I lowered the brightness to an even dimmer setting (the panel goes all the way up to 400 nits, so even half or three-quarter brightness can drain the battery fairly quickly). It should go without saying too, that models with a lower-res 1080p screen will probably have longer runtime, just because there are fewer pixels to light up. In any case, the new XPS 13 represents a tremendous improvement over the original version from 2012, which could barely crack five hours (and that was with a lower-resolution screen, too). Just as important, the XPS 13's battery life matches other thin-and-light machines we've tested recently, including the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro and Acer Aspire S7. The fact is, for a laptop that's this thin and this light with that pixel-dense a screen, getting eight hours on a charge is pretty respectable. And again, I suspect it's actually capable of lasting even longer than that. Should the built-in battery not be enough, Dell also sells a spare, 12,000mAh cell for $120 that plugs into the laptop's power port, much the same way you'd use a mobile charger to refuel a phone or tablet. All told, Dell claims that the Power Companion, as it's called, can help the XPS 13 reach 22 hours of battery life. That's impressive, to be sure, and it's also more convenient than swapping out your notebook's built-in battery or attaching a cumbersome sheet to the bottom. As a bonus, the charger also has two USB ports for charging mobile devices, which means you could potentially travel with just one adapter for all your gadgets. As for bloatware, Dell may have once had a reputation for loading its Windows PCs up with unwanted programs, but the manufacturer has apparently turned over a new leaf. There's very little here in the way of superfluous apps; just Flipboard, Microsoft's own Bing Translator and 20GB of Dropbox storage, free for one year. There's also a trial of McAfee LiveSafe Internet Security and Microsoft Office (activation key required). And... that's it. Configuration options The XPS starts at $800, with base specs that include an Intel Core i3-5010U Broadwell processor, 4GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD, Intel HD 5500 Graphics and a matte (non-glare) 1,920 x 1,080 screen. As I hinted earlier, though, that low starting price is slightly disingenuous when you remember it doesn't come standard with a touchscreen. Not that you need one, per se, but many users will want one, especially considering how touch-optimized Windows 8 is (and Windows 10, when it comes out). If you do want that 3,200 x 1,800 touch panel, be prepared to pay at least $1,300. In addition, you'll find some mid-range configurations that give you the Core i5 processor with a 1080p screen with either 4GB or 8GB of RAM. Throughout the line too, there are configurations with larger 256GB solid-state drives. At the higher end, Dell is even offering a couple Core i7 configs, one of which has a 512GB SSD. That top-of-the-line model goes for $1,900. All in all, then, you've got a lot of customization options -- more than on most Ultrabooks, in fact. The competition The Dell XPS 13 is going to be a smart buy for many, many people. But it's also in good company: I can think of several other ultraportables you'd probably be happy to own. For starters, there's Lenovo's convertible Yoga 3 Pro ($1,299-plus), which measures just half an inch thick and weighs only 2.62 pounds -- crazy light for a machine with a 360-degree hinge. The only potential downside is that it runs one of Intel's low-powered \"Core M\" chips, which aren't quite as robust as fifth-generation Core processors. If you need a little more oomph, Lenovo is also readying a 1.7-pound laptop -- the world's lightest 13-inch PC, in fact -- which, despite its dainty frame, will run full-fledged Core CPUs. The only thing is: It's not shipping until May, which could be a problem if you need a new notebook now. There are a couple other options too, but I haven't had a chance to test all of them. One is the new Samsung ATIV Book 9, a 12.2-inch, fanless machine that uses a Core M processor to achieve a thin design. Of note: It comes standard with a 2,560 x 1,600 screen that goes all the way up to an impressive 700 nits of brightness. Aside from the lower-powered processor, the only real concession seems to be that machine isn't offered with a touchscreen. Meanwhile, some of our favorite Ultrabooks have been refreshed with Broadwell processors, theoretically bringing them in line with newer machines like the XPS 13. These include Acer's Aspire S7 ($1,300-plus) and Samsung's ATIV Book 9 Plus ($1,299-plus). Microsoft's Surface Pro 3 actually hasn't been updated with Broadwell, but it's nonetheless a well-built, thin and light tablet that more or less matches the XPS 13 on battery life. If you mainly want a laptop, a proper Ultrabook is still your best bet. But if you want the option of using your device in tablet mode, both the Surface Pro 3 and the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro are good choices. And what of the MacBook Air, which I keep comparing to Dell's new machine? I'm sure there are some folks out there who insist on OS X, and probably aren't giving serious consideration to the XPS 13 (or any Windows machine, for that matter). Even if you are Mac-leaning, though, you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you bought an Air now. Don't get me wrong: It's a well-built machine with long battery life, but it's also sorely in need of an update. As of this writing, Apple hasn't refreshed it with fifth-generation Core processors. And that's not even taking into account that a new, drastically smaller device might be in the works. If you think you want an OS X-based machine, I'd suggest you wait, if possible. Wrap-up There's a reason the XPS 13 was a Best of CES finalist: It's not only one of the top laptops we saw at the show, but also one of the finest PCs we're likely to see for months to come. If you're in the market for a new Windows laptop -- something small and light with fast performance and a great screen -- this should absolutely be on your short list. There are other fine choices too, as I've laid out in the previous section, but the XPS 13 is a winner its own right, with very few flaws to speak of. The only things I'd caution you of are the touchpad (it needs a little work) and the battery life, which is merely average, at least on the touch edition. Speaking of, it's on the pricey side if you do indeed configure it with a touchscreen. Even then, though, the $1,300 asking price is worth it. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: broadwell, dell, dellxps, dellxps13, review, uk-reviews, xps13 \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21132167 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21132167\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/dell/xps/13/2015/\"> Dell XPS 13 (2015) </a> Dell XPS 13 (2015) Buy from $918 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/dell/xps/13/2015/\" title=\"Dell XPS 13 (2015) reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 4 </a> Prices Discussions Type Midsize Screen size 13 inches Screen resolution 3200 x 1800 Bundled OS Windows Pointing device Trackpad Video outputs DisplayPort Announced 2015-01-06 see all specs \u2192 8.8average user rating Speed and features 8.7 Design and form factor 10 Battery life 9.3 Display 8.7 Durability 8.7 Expandability 8 Noise 9.3 Portability (size / weight) 9.3 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $918.00 + tax & shipping Buy now No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/21/ipad-air-2-mini-3-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "October 21st 2014 at 9:01 pm", "body": " It's a conflicting time for Apple. On one hand, it's a joyous occasion for the company because its latest iPhones, which come in larger screen sizes than the last, set new sales records worldwide; but on the other hand, its lineup of iPads just experienced its third straight quarterly decline. Coincidentally, this comes just a week after Apple announced its annual tablet refresh, which includes a thinner and more powerful version of the iPad Air along with a Touch ID-enabled mini with Retina display. Just because it's down doesn't mean it's out. Giving up on a product category isn't really Apple's style, and last week, it offered up the Air 2 as exhibit A. The company made it clear that making a solid top-of-the-line tablet is on the top of its to-do list, so naturally the new 10-inch device got plenty of upgrades in nearly every aspect of its design. Curiously, it didn't give the mini lineup the same kind of treatment: The mini 3 got so little love this time around that the best news about it is the fact that last year's version is now $100 cheaper. Should the new iPads still get a place in the consumer's backpack? Read on to find out.

It's a solid upgrade over last year's Air, and should definitely be one of your top tablet considerations. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") 85 Apple iPad mini 3 Pros Touch ID now comes included Long battery life Good performance Cons Only a couple of upgrades\u00a0 Commands a $100 premium over last year's model Summary The iPad mini 3 is just as good as its predecessor, but its lack of feature upgrades doesn't justify its price and places it behind the Air 2 in specs. Unless you love Apple's fingerprint sensor and Apple Pay, you may want to opt for last year's model instead. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware iPad Air 2 Thinner, lighter, more powerful. It sounds a lot like last year's iPad Air, which was reduced to the thickness of a pencil, but in fact, I'm talking about the sequel. At 6.1mm thick, an 18 percent decrease from the original Air's 7.5mm, you'll be hard-pressed to find a thinner tablet; Samsung's Tab S comes close at 6.6mm. It's not easy to build such a thin device that feels just as sturdy as its thicker brethren, but Apple nailed it with the Air 2. The new slate has lost weight, too, but not as much as the last one did: While the first Air managed to lose nearly half a pound over the iPad 4, the next version only trims off 0.04 pound (32g) for a total of 0.96 pound (the LTE-enabled version is a few grams heavier). So, it's lighter, but the change isn't anywhere near as noticeable this time around. The design language hasn't changed: The Air still features an aluminum build, chamfered edges and the same footprint as before. But Apple insists that it rebuilt the new tablet from the ground up. After all, cramming better specs into a thinner package requires some creative thinking. The good news is that it looks and feels fantastic, and it comes with a no-gap display, better camera, more powerful chipset, Touch ID and stronger wireless connections. The bad news is that some compromises were made -- specifically in the area of battery size, which has plummeted from 32.4Whr to 27.3 (more on this later). Aside from being thinner, there are a couple other ways you can tell a new Air from an old one. The first is the inclusion of Touch ID, Apple's fingerprint sensor that was introduced last year in the iPhone 5s. It's certainly a welcome feature, and one I've been hoping to see on an iPad ever since the iPhone 5s debuted; I can't count how many times I tried unlocking my iPad this way before remembering it doesn't have this feature. What's more, Touch ID is even more useful now than it was before; iOS 8 enabled third-party developer support for the fingerprint sensor, so you can use it to access sensitive account information or passwords. It also facilitates online payments through Apple Pay, but since no new iPad comes with NFC, you won't be able to use your huge tablet at a tap-to-pay station. (Update: iFixit's teardown of the iPad Air 2 reveals that it features the same NFC module as the iPhones 6.) The Air 2 also doesn't have a mute switch, which I didn't think would be a huge loss until I actually found myself trying to use it and becoming frustrated more frequently than I expected. Your new options are to press and hold the volume down button or go into the Control Center and press the mute key; if you used the switch to lock screen orientation, you'll need to do that in the Control Center as well. A microphone now sits where the mute switch once was; there's another one right next to the camera. This means the antenna on the top of the WiFi+Cellular model is no longer interrupted by mic holes. Inside, the Air 2 comes with a new A8X chipset, which I'll discuss later on. In short, Apple has added another CPU core, boosted graphics performance and doubled the RAM. But it's also followed the iPhone 6 by adding the M8 motion coprocessor, which includes a barometer so you can track flights climbed. Other additions include 802.11ac WIFi, which can get you faster connections (provided you have a compatible router); 20 LTE bands, which should be more than enough for most international travelers; and up to 150 Mbps cellular download speeds if your carrier offers it. iPad mini 3 Apple's message for the iPad mini changed dramatically in the past year. When it debuted last fall, the iPad mini with Retina display was given feature parity with the Air. The two devices were nearly twins, with the exception of size and a difference in color accuracy (which we'll get into soon). In the end, iPad buyers found that the toughest decision was which size to pick. Fast-forward a year, and the mini 3 has been largely forgotten. Even the fourth-gen iPad, which was released only eight months after the previous version with a performance boost and Lightning port, looks like a bigger upgrade. Gallery | 25 Photos iPad Mini 3 review + See all 25 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Indeed, there's only one major feature change on the mini 3: Touch ID. Yep, that's all, unless you count a gold color option as an actual feature (I don't). Otherwise, the hardware is completely identical to last year's mini. All of the stuff you just read (and will continue to read) about getting improved on the Air 2? Nowhere to be found. The dimensions and design style all remain the same as the last mini. Whereas Apple says it built the Air 2 from the ground up, the mini 3 just seems like an afterthought to make it look like the mini line hasn't been forgotten. Well, it hasn't been, but it does look strange that the larger tablet is once again considered the premier option with the best specs. The sudden change in product strategy doesn't add up. Apple SIM This may be the very first time a SIM card has earned its own section in an Engadget review. But a new type of nano-SIM card preinstalled in the Air 2 and mini 3 is worth a mention. Buried in the last few lines of a press release is Apple's first mention of a new \"Apple SIM,\" a first-of-its-kind card that lets you change your cellular carrier without also changing the SIM card. This convenience is limited to just a few countries and carriers at launch -- Sprint, T-Mobile and AT&T in the US and EE in the UK -- but over time, the selection of willing operators may improve. It's still very much in the early stages right now, but the idea is a natural fit for an iPad, which doesn't come with a carrier lock or a contract; people will want to switch among carriers depending on what kind of coverage they need and what types of data plans become available. My review units came with carrier-branded SIMs, but the Apple-specific chips should come preinstalled when they're shipped. (If you prefer a non-supported carrier, such as Verizon, a new chip will be provided for you.) There's still no way of knowing whether this is a proprietary technology or if Apple is licensing it; if it's the latter, it's possible that the option will eventually be available for non-Apple devices as well. Display The Air 2 has the same 2,048 x 1,536 resolution as all the Retina iPads that have come before it; Retina HD does not exist in the tablet lineup. But as I mentioned earlier, Apple was able to trim down the iPad by using a laminated, optically bonded, no-gap display similar to the ones used on the iPhone and even the Microsoft Surface tablets. Not only does the new panel save vertical space by eliminating any gaps of air between the display layers, but it also makes the screen significantly less reflective. This is meant to reduce the amount of glare hitting the screen, whether you're reading in direct sunlight or watching movies under harsh fluorescent lights. I'm happy to report that it works as advertised; I was able to read text and look at photos much better on the Air 2 than the previous version. Tapping on the screen also doesn't feel as hollow on the new tablet as it did on last year's. Still, Apple seems to have achieved this at the expense of white balance, which seems slightly colder than on the first Air. For the iPad mini, I have a confession to make. As I reviewed last year's model, I praised the display for its high pixel density and good looks -- and in many ways this still rings true a full year later -- but I didn't catch a glaring difference between it and the original iPad Air's display: The colors on the mini with Retina display have a narrower gamut than the Air, so the hues are flatter; they simply don't provide the same kind of punch that the Air does. That was something I didn't want to miss again, so I took a closer look to see if Apple had corrected anything on the mini 3, or if the color gamut would remain consistent among all three devices in the series. If you didn't like it before, expect to see more of the same; any changes in color accuracy are extremely minor, as the Air lineup continues to offer a better experience here than the mini. The below image shows the difference between the Air 2 and the mini 3 displays. iOS 8.1 iOS 8.1 is the third update to Apple's new mobile OS in just over a month, after a bug fix that was immediately followed by another fix to correct the problems introduced in that initial update. The refresh was made available to every compatible iPhone and iPad yesterday, and the new iPads will come with it preinstalled, bypassing the lengthy download and install process. Because the Air 2 and mini 3 both use Touch ID, they can take advantage of the biggest new feature in the update: Apple Pay. But since they don't have Near-Field Communication (NFC) chips installed, you can't do tap to pay; you can only use the service for online payments. This isn't a huge issue, since most people will prefer using their phones (or Apple Watch) to buy stuff in retail outlets; it'd be much easier to whip out my wallet and swipe my card than take an iPad out of my bag to use tap-to-pay. Apple Pay isn't the only benefit you get in 8.1. In the initial iOS 8 release, the company oddly left out the Camera Roll. You could still see all of the images you took on your phone or tablet, but if you were using iCloud and had multiple devices, there was no way to tell which photo or video was taken on which product. This week, it's back in the Albums tab. With 8.1, you'll also get to beta test the iCloud Photo Library, which uploads and stores your collection o' memories so that you can edit and share them from any of your Apple devices. If you have less than 5GB in your album and don't want to pay anything, it's definitely worth doing. If you've got more than that, you'll need to pony up some cash in order to store it all: 20GB costs a dollar per month in the US; 200GB is $4; 500GB is $10; and 1TB is $20. Finally, 8.1 enables some of the Handoff and Continuity features I discussed in the iOS 8 review, such as sending and receiving text messages on your Mac, and Instant Hotspot, which makes it possible to automatically tether your computer to your mobile device. These features were announced as part of iOS 8 in June, but needed Apple's new desktop operating system, OS X Yosemite, to work properly. Camera I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the target demographic for a tablet camera. I used to make fun of the whole idea of taking pictures with a 10-inch gadget, but clearly it's a trend that's not going away, as a brief visit to any theme park, tourist attraction, concert or Vegas sidewalk will prove. So, I can't blame Apple for catering to this growing group of people who prefer a large viewfinder. The iPad Air 2 is a prime example of this. While the mini 3 doesn't gain improved imaging capabilities, the Air 2 steps up to 8MP resolution (versus 5MP in the Air) and has a new Image Signal Processor (ISP) as part of the new A8X chipset. On the software side, the new camera comes with Burst Mode, as well as slow-motion video capture in 720p at 120fps. There's still no LED flash on front or back this time around, however. Gallery | 72 Photos iPad Air 2 camera samples + See all 72 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Overall, the improvement in detail is obvious, and imaging is noticeably better in a few other areas as well. The white balance is slightly improved; colors are a little more accurate; and harshly backlit images aren't as blown out as they were on the previous Air. And although the f/2.4 aperture is the same on both cameras, the new ISP manages to filter out more noise in low-light situations; it still won't catch as much errant light as the iPhone, however. Apple also says the 1.2MP FaceTime camera should do a better job of reducing noise, but I couldn't see any real difference in side-by-side comparisons. (You can see full-res images taken by the Air 2 camera here, and samples from the original Air can be found here.) Performance and battery life iPad Air 2 iPad Air iPad mini 3 NVIDIA Shield Tablet Geekbench 3.0 4,510 2,646 2,470 3,423 Basemark X 29,518 15,231 14,839 TBD 3DMark IS Unlimited 21,659 15,536 14,595 30,970 SunSpider 1.0 (ms) 303 404 439 463 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan Off/onscreen (fps) 32.4/24.6 13.0/8.8 13.0/8.8 31.0/29.7 SunSpider: Lower scores are better. Strap on your seat belts, kids -- the iPad Air 2 is speedy. The irony is not lost on me as I say it, given that we seem to say the same thing with every new iPad. Indeed, the Air 2 fits that bill perfectly: It's predictably more powerful than its predecessor, thanks to the A8X chipset inside, but there's a bit more to the tablet's oomph this time around. Apple's making a jump from a dual-core processor to one with three cores; the CPU is clocked at 1.5GHz, a 100MHz bump from the original Air; the L2 cache doubled from 1MB to 2MB; and it also comes with 2GB of RAM, twice as much as the last few iPads. It's no surprise, then, why the company is boasting a 40 percent boost in CPU performance and an increase in graphics prowess by a factor of 2.5. So yes, the iPad was powerful before, and it's even more so now. Apple says the new chip is optimized for apps and games that use Metal, a framework that gets rid of a lot of the overhead that gets between a developer and the GPU. It also takes advantage of 3D graphics processing and other advanced computing capabilities. The A8X will increase the performance of every app regardless of whether or not they use Metal, but I focused more heavily on apps and games that do. One such app was Replay, a video highlight tool featured in last week's keynote. The app takes images you've curated from your photo library and puts them into a cool montage-like video; you can add music, text and other effects to give some extra pizzazz to your Facebook slideshow of the family trip to Disneyland. The A8X showed its chops when it was time to save and render the video; I did the same exact video on both iPad Airs (iPads Air?), and the original wasn't even halfway through the job when the Air 2 completed the task. It's clear that the A8X can make a huge difference over the A7 in many areas, but I didn't see as drastic a performance improvement with existing games that use Metal. I tried several, such as Asphalt 8, Beach Buggy Racing, Modern Combat 5 and Epic Zen Garden. As expected, I experienced fewer frame skips, smoother play and faster load times, all of which are nearly givens anytime there's a boost in graphics capacity. And the Air 2 is a winner for this alone. The only downside was that I saw the same number of fine details in the A8X during gameplay as I saw in the A7. When comparing the two Airs side by side, I saw the same reflections in puddles, blazing fires, other characters, falling buildings, exploding helicopters and other elements. Still good, but not a night-and-day difference. The improvements in this area were not as noticeable as I'd anticipated, but hopefully A8X-optimized games will come out soon that push the chip's graphics capabilities to the limit. The benchmarks sided with Replay in terms of performance. I saw massive bumps in test scores on Geekbench 3 and Basemark X (nearly double that of the Air), as well as a 6,000-point increase on 3DMark. I also notched a 25 percent decrease in SunSpider, which was the lowest score I've ever seen on any mobile device (SunSpider scores are like golf -- the lower the better); finally, I was also impressed by the onscreen and offscreen GFXBench results. However, while the iPad is still among the most powerful tablets on the market, it's got some serious competition; the NVIDIA Tegra K1-powered Shield Tablet crunches some numbers that surpass the Air 2's scores, with others getting incredibly close. Tablet Battery Life iPad Air 2 11:15 iPad mini 3 13:45 Microsoft Surface 2 14:22 iPad Air 13:45 (LTE) Apple iPad mini 12:43 (WiFi) Samsung Galaxy Tab S (10-inch) 12:30 Apple iPad mini with Retina display 11:55 (LTE) Apple iPad (late 2012) 11:08 (WiFi) Apple iPad 2 10:26 Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 10:04 Apple iPad (2012) 9:52 (HSPA) / 9:37 (LTE) Acer Iconia W4 9:50 Nexus 7 (2012) 9:49 Microsoft Surface RT 9:36 Toshiba Encore 8:45 Sony Xperia Tablet Z 8:40 Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet 7:57 Nexus 10 7:26 Dell Venue 8 Pro 7:19 Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 7:18 Nexus 7 (2013) 7:15 Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 7:13 Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 6:55 A thinner profile comes at the expense of battery size. The new Air's is 5.1Whr smaller than the old one, but Apple still promises that you'll get the same 10-hour battery life because the A8X is more power-efficient. Real-life use shows that the original Air still rules the roost; after a day of heavy use, I typically went to bed with around 20 percent left in the tank. If you're only using it moderately -- say, for casual content creation or consumption -- you should get a little over two days. In our video test, in which an HD movie plays through the life of the battery, the Air 2 squeezed out 11 hours and 15 minutes, significantly lower than last year's Air and about an hour short of the Samsung Tab S. That said, I'm using the WiFi+Cellular version, so keep in mind that the WiFi-only option should get longer results. On the flip side, the mini 3 actually improved in battery life over the last model, getting nearly 14 hours of video before dying. On the plus side, the loudspeakers have improved. In side-by-side tests with the original Air, the sequel's speakers produced even louder and fuller sound than its predecessor, which came in handy while listening to podcasts and streaming music around the house. The competition As usual, the new iPads come in WiFi-only and WiFi+Cellular options, with the WiFi-only models beginning at $499 for the Air 2 and $399 for the mini 3. In both cases, the base models have 16GB of storage. Meanwhile, the cellular options start at $629 for the Air 2 and $529 for the mini 3. If you need more storage -- and given how much available space is required just to update your devices these days, I strongly recommend it -- you'll need to add an extra $100 to get 64GB of storage and $200 for 128GB. As with the new iPhones, the iPads are no longer offered with 32GB. The new iPads aren't the only show in town. Google's Nexus 9, which comes out in two weeks, will likely be a strong performer thanks to its NVIDIA K1 chip, a 2.3GHz dual-core processor with 64-bit support. (This is the \"Denver\" variant of the chip inside the NVIDIA Shield, so the Nexus 9 should keep up with the Air 2.) Apple got a nice head start on 64-bit support when it released the A7 chip last year, so it'll take some time for developers to take full advantage of their newfound abilities. The baseline, WiFi-only Nexus 9, which includes 16GB of internal storage, will go for $399; this puts it as solid competition against the mini 3, although its screen size is right in between the mini and Air. There's also the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet, which is now going for around $460 and packs plenty of punch, and the Samsung Tab S, which comes with an octa-core chip and 3GB of RAM for the same price as the Air 2. The mini 3 will also soon have to compete against Sony's Z3 Tablet Compact, an 8-inch waterproof slate that is now available for pre-order. It's 6.4mm thin and comes with a 2.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor with 3GB of RAM, but you're also paying for the extra features: it's priced starting at $499, which is a fair amount higher than Apple's already high-priced option. If you like the smaller form factor, but don't love the price, there's also the Shield Tablet, which comes with the aforementioned K1 chip and is available starting at $299; it's more gaming-minded than your usual Android tablet, but it's a fantastic performer that soundly beats out the mini 3. There's also the Google Nexus 7, which was discontinued, but still available on Amazon and other retailers for around $200. And finally, last year's iPad mini with Retina display is now $100 cheaper at $299, while the original mini is $249. However, that $50 difference also means you lose the Retina display; it's definitely worth the money to go with the higher resolution. Likewise, the original Air is now $399, $100 cheaper than its successor. Wrap-up In the wake of dire sales, the Air 2 is exactly what Apple needed to keep the lineup fresh. It may not be a brand-new design, per se, but its thin frame helps keep the marquee tablet looking sleek and exciting, and the extra burst of performance ensures that it stays among the most powerful tablets on the market for the next year. It could use a little help with battery life compared to the Air, but it's still an improvement over the iPad fourth-gen and older. Most importantly, the Air 2 feels like Apple hasn't given up on the tablet form factor, even if it's experiencing a dip in sales. That said, I'm not sure where the mini 3 fits into Apple's strategy. Since the only hardware improvement to the new slate is Touch ID, the mini lineup is no longer on par with the Airs; it's now a second-class tablet citizen. I love Touch ID, and I favor the screen size of the mini, but it's not worth paying an extra $100 for Apple's fingerprint sensor unless you use a ton of passwords or want to make a lot of online Apple Pay purchases. It's still a great performer, but I can't help but wonder if the mini lineup can remain relevant at its price point -- especially now that 5.5-inch iPhones are even more portable and still offer a large screen. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: air2, apple, ipadair, ipadair2, ipadmini, ipadmini3, mini3, mobilepostcross, retinadisplay, review, video \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20980260 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20980260\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/apple/ipad/air-2/\"> Apple iPad Air 2 </a> Apple iPad Air 2 16GB 64GB 128GB 16GB LTE 64GB LTE 128GB LTE Buy from $499 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/apple/ipad/air-2/\" title=\"Apple iPad Air 2 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 11 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Tablet Operating system iOS (8) Screen size 9.7 inches Storage type Internal storage (16 GB, Flash) Maximum battery life Up to 10 hours Dimensions 9.4 x 6.6 x 0.24 in Weight 0.96 lb Announced 2014-10-16 see all specs \u2192 9.3average user rating Features 9.3 Display 9.5 Battery life 8.4 Ease of use 9.6 Storage capacity 8.9 Design and form factor 9.6 Portability (size / weight) 9.8 Durability 8.2 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 Displaying prices for model: 16GB-Silver 16GB-Gray 16GB-Gold 64GB-Gray 64GB-Silver 64GB-Gold 128GB-Silver 128GB-Gold 128GB-Gray $499.00 + tax & shipping Buy now $499.99 + tax & shipping Buy now $555.30 + tax & shipping Buy now 5 Share your impressions of the Apple iPad keynote? 2 Is Apple losing their focus on hardware? 2 What's the best (cheap) tablet for seniors?

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/19/ee-tv-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "November 19th 2014 at 8:05 am", "body": " EE has evolved rapidly since it became a household name two years ago after switching on the UK's first 4G mobile network. Today, it's more than just a carrier, with a home broadband business and a selection of own-brand mobile devices, among other things. And now, EE's decided to turn its hand to home entertainment, having recently launched the EE TV set-top box. Free and available only to customers of EE's mobile and broadband services, it's essentially a Freeview DVR with a few tricks up its sleeve. Tying into EE's primary focus on mobile, one of the fancier features is the box's ability to stream live and recorded video to multiple smartphones and tablets simultaneously. But is a free DVR with a couple of advanced capabilities enough of an incentive to get you signed up for the required services (which is sort of the point)? Not really, no. Gallery | 16 Photos EE TV review + See all 16 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 74 EE EE TV Pros Fast and intuitive menu interface Mobile streaming feature works great 24/7 recording functionality Cons Sluggish EPG Little more than Freeview content offered Complex barrier to ownership Summary EE TV is a pretty good Freeview DVR with some unique functionality. These advanced features, however, aren't without their limitations, but my main gripe with the set-top box is that you have to commit to buying all of EE's other services in order to get one.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") To be a leading telecoms brand, you need to get involved in the four main connected utilities: landline, broadband, mobile and TV. Virgin Media, TalkTalk and now EE offer the full quartet, but Sky and BT aren't far behind, with the mobile-shaped holes in their lineups looking like they'll be filled soon enough. Vodafone's planning an aggressive expansion next year too, starting with its own broadband service and later, some form of TV offering. The issue EE has right now is that it's competing with established TV providers, and while its set-top box might have some unique features, there's nothing you can actually watch on it you can't find easily elsewhere. Content When it comes to available content, EE TV doesn't have a lot to brag about. It's a Freeview player, feeding off the 70-plus TV channels and 25-odd radio stations that are broadcast subscription-free across the UK. EE TV doesn't cost anything itself, so the fact that it doesn't include access to premium channels isn't exactly surprising. The only problem with that, though, is that the vast majority of people already have Freeview at home, whether it's built into their TV or picked up by a box sitting beneath it. And, I imagine those who don't currently receive Freeview are unlikely to sign mobile and home broadband contracts just to get hold of EE's set-top box. Rival telecoms Sky, Virgin Media, BT and TalkTalk are either broadcasters in their own right, or at least offer a wide range of channels you simply won't find on Freeview. You have to pay for the privilege, of course, but in that sense, all four are true TV providers. EE, on the other hand, is merely offering a piece of hardware as a bonus to customers who sign up for its mobile, broadband and, by default, landline services. The conundrum, then is, by not attaching a value to something, how are you to judge its worth? Now, EE can't rightly charge a subscription for its Freeview box, but with no premium content partners, it's completely reliant on the perceived value of its box's feature set. I get that the company's trying to mould a product ecosystem, but there's one thing I'm certain of: EE isn't a \"quad-play\" provider just yet. EE TV isn't a service. It's a DVR, and one you can't even buy -- more of a \"thank you\" for choosing EE as your mobile and broadband supplier. Needless to say, I can't quite figure out the strategy here, but maybe there isn't one to miss. Perhaps it's just a case of doing something because you can. In addition to live TV, EE's box can also tap into various catch-up, on-demand and similar services via apps. Pickings are unfortunately slim at the moment, though, with BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport, Demand 5, YouTube and Wuaki.tv as the only notable launch partners. Better than nothing, I guess, but hardly something to get excited about when familiar names such as ITV Player and 4oD aren't even on board yet. I mean, EE's own movie-rental service EE Film (available on mobile devices through desktop browsers) isn't accessible through the box. Also, after speaking with the company, it doesn't sound like there are any immediate plans to port over EE Film, either. Instead, users are invited to try Wuaki.tv, a competing service. EE has said that in time, more apps will begin populating the store. That's great and all, but for now, EE TV is by no means a one-stop shop for all your viewing needs. If you have any form of connected home-entertainment gear -- a smart TV, games console, set-top box, Roku, Now TV, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast, et cetera -- then you already have access to so many content portals that EE's selection is irrelevant in comparison. It's also worth pointing out that YouView boxes (retail or BT-/TalkTalk-issued) have plenty more apps, including Netflix, and some of the same basic DVR features as EE TV. It's not clear exactly how EE intends to bulk out the app catalogue, but really it's got one of two options: Pay big names like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video to get on board, or employ the riskier tactic of hoping they see enough value in EE TV that they invest in development themselves. Hardware I'll spare you all the gritty details of what's inside the Netgem-made set-top box, mainly because the clock speed of its processor doesn't tell you anything about what it can actually do. One component that is worth mentioning, however, is the 1TB hard drive, which EE says is capable of storing approximately 600 hours of standard-definition video or half that of HD content. With dimensions of 200 x 200 x 38mm, EE TV is quite a neat little box that should slot nicely into even the most minimalist of living room TV setups. On the flip side, my TV stand is a cavernous mess of consoles, speakers and other equipment, and yet I easily found a home for the additional box, though I'm not sure my Xbox 360 appreciates its new hat. If you happen to have a dedicated sound system, chances are you'll be able to plug EE TV into it, thanks to a mix of digital and RCA audio-out ports on the back of the box. These are joined by a coaxial-in port for plugging in your aerial, and coaxial-/HDMI-out ports for hooking the thing up to your TV. There's also a small SCART connector, should you need it, but you'll have to ask EE to send you a free cable as it's not included in the packaging. To get the box online, you can use an Ethernet hardline or the built-in dual-band 802.11b/g/n WiFi. Now, unless you're seriously picky about the stuff that fills your entertainment centre, I doubt the outward appearance of EE TV is something you're going to care much about. That being said, it's not unattractive as far as small, square boxes go. It's crafted from a combination of shiny and matte black plastics, which gives it a pleasant visual texture that'll be familiar to anyone who owns an Xbox One or PS4. The only other design accents are an EE logo and relatively large light (which radiates green when on and red on standby) on the front of the box, as well as a wide, square grille on top that lets you peek through at the components. The EE TV remote also has a certain amount of character to it. Its corners are rounded and square in equal measures, and it's bound in a textured, rubbery plastic. While this cladding makes it look nicer than your average remote, I get the impression it would end up noticeably scuffed if it spent a few months being pushed around my coffee table. All the important buttons are clustered around a central directional pad, and I only mention the layout because I found myself navigating it like a touch-typist after just a couple of days. User Experience When it comes to actually using EE TV on a day-to-day basis, you've kinda gotta take the rough with the smooth. In some situations, it functions better than you might expect it to, and then it goes and disappoints elsewhere. The initial setup process, for one, is extremely quick and easy. When you first switch the box on, you connect it to your EE router via WiFi or Ethernet, then set up a PIN for the child-safety measure. If you choose to enable this, adult channels, anything marked with a parental guidance notice and content recorded after the 9 PM watershed will be locked to the little ones. Following these steps, you can choose to set up the \"Replay\" recording feature (more on this later) right off the bat, or not, and then you're good to go. Gallery | 22 Photos EE TV UI screenshots + See all 22 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") EE says the set-top box's main menu was designed with mobile functionality in mind, and it's true that the EE TV apps look almost identical to the TV UI. The interface employs the same \"content-first,\" image-driven approach that's common to entertainment-focused devices and services nowadays -- the Xbox One and BBC iPlayer UIs are a couple of examples that instantly spring to mind. EE's put its own little twist on things, of course, with the brand's familiar teal colour scheme, soft font and simple icon style permeating every inch of the UI. The main menu itself consists of four \"panes,\" for lack of a better word: On Demand, Live TV, Recordings and Replay (in that order). The On Demand section is where you hop into apps like Wuaki.tv, but Live TV is always the first thing you see when you turn the box on. It consists of a live feed of the last channel you were watching, flanked on two sides by smaller, static frames that tell you what's currently airing on the five primary terrestrial channels. Icons off to the right of this arrangement let you load up the electronic programming guide (EPG) -- which the \"Guide\" button on the remote does from anywhere. From here, you can also check out what's on the radio or step into the live-channel sorting office. From here, you can view all channels in order, or sort them by popularity or content type, which is handy if you're specifically looking for movies, sports or kids programming, as a few examples. Gallery | 17 Photos EE TV app screenshots + See all 17 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") The Recordings and Replay panes are laid out in a similar way. Recently recorded content is given pride of place in dedicated windows, but there's always a deeper menu beyond for sorting and categorizing. It's all very easy to understand, and is cleverly built so you can always filter and find the content you want in only a few \"clicks.\" What's more, it's impressively fast, meaning you can fly between panes without any noticeable input lag. It slows down slightly in the deeper sorting menus, but not to the extent that it even approaches frustrating. All sounds good so far, right? Well, as slick as the menu system is, you're almost certainly going to be spending much more time flicking through the EPG, cruising for something to watch. And, unfortunately, the EPG is so sluggish it drives me to distraction. Pressing the Guide button on the remote brings up the EPG instantly, but it then takes a second or two to populate the listings for the eight channels in the grid. Page down, and you have to wait another second for those listings to load, and so on. This kind of downtime is almost more annoying because the rest of the user interface is so fast. I have no idea why this information isn't constantly being cached in the background so the full directory is available whenever you might want it. And if there's a technical reason this can't be done, I don't believe it. When you are watching a channel, you can bring up mini EPGs by prodding the directional pad. One pops up on the left side of the screen, and shows you what's on other channels, while the other rises from the bottom of the screen and tells you upcoming programming on the channel you're watching. Both of these are fully populated straight away, making the slow, main EPG even more of a curiosity. There are plenty of other good and bad points to highlight about the EPG. It consumes the screen when you summon it, but it's semitransparent so you can still see the channel you're currently on through it, which is a nice touch. The programme details pop-up, like the EPG itself, takes a second to load when you hit the information button on the remote, but here you'll also find when subsequent episodes of that particular show are being broadcast over the next seven days. You can schedule recordings or reminders from within this overlay, which is charmingly intuitive. In fact, anywhere you might conceive the record command to have an effect, it does. The first option that presents itself, however, is to record the entire series of a programme, which means you're always another button press away from just recording that one episode. Advanced features As EE TV is a DVR, the idea is that you'll do more than just watch TV on it, such as recording content to the box for consuming it whenever you fancy. You can pause and rewind live TV, of course, but the box's main selling points revolve around its advanced features. Like the general user experience, though, these snazzy functions come with their own limitations. Replay Replay is a really neat feature that lets you select up to six channels to record 24/7. (Well, almost, as for some reason Replay won't record anything aired between 3 AM and 5 AM in the morning.) You can tell the box to keep the last six, 12, 18 or 24 hours of content before it starts deleting the oldest recordings to make room for the new. With Replay disabled, all four of the box's tuners are available to you, meaning you can record up to four different channels at once. Switch the feature on, and two of those tuners are reserved for Replay, while the other two are still free for you to record up to two other channels at the same time. Replay content has its own section in the main menu, making it all easily searchable, but you can also cycle through past broadcasts in the EPG and launch recordings from there. This is particularly handy if you've missed the start of something you want to watch, because you can simply jump to the beginning of the broadcast. There's no denying this is a great feature, and one you won't find on other set-top boxes, but it's more of a half-feature due to the limited selection of channels you can select to \"Replay\" -- in other words, it's not available on every Freeview channel. In fact, only the well-known terrestrial providers are supported, with the entire channel selection as follows: BBC 1/2/3/4 CBBC/CBeebies BBC News & BBC Parliament ITV1/2 Channel 4/E4/Film4/More4 Channel 5 Now, I get that these are all popular channels, but the limitation is still frustrating to me. I'd like to revisit some of the budget flicks that air on Movie Mix at 2 AM on a Wednesday morning, but I can't. There is technical reason for this, though, as EE explained to me. Freeview channels are broadcast in groups, known as multiplexes. What Replay does is record a whole multiplex, which only uses one tuner, and then splits the individual channels out at the box level. Thus, you can only record two different multiplexes at any one time, so EE chose to offer the most popular \"as a starting point.\" Even with this understandable explanation, though, somehow this limitation feels like a broken promise. Oh, and you also can't record any HD versions of the channels listed above. This, too, makes sense, as EE needs to limit how much hard drive space Replay content occupies. Still, more fine print. What I find most frustrating about the Replay feature is that recordings can't be saved permanently. If Replay captured a particularly good film you wouldn't mind watching again, for example, there's no way to rescue it from being deleted when the next cycle rolls around. You just have to hope it's being aired again soon so you can schedule a proper recording. Mobile streaming EE TV's most-hyped feature is the ability to stream video to up to four devices at once, though one of these will always be your main TV. The EE TV apps for Android and iOS look and behave like the big-screen UI. In this sense, whatever tablet or phone you're using becomes an EE TV in its own right. You can schedule recordings through the app, use your phone as a secondary remote and \"fling\" anything you're watching on a mobile device to the TV in one swipe. It's extremely hard to pick fault with the mobile integration, because everything just works flawlessly. Give the app a \"fling\" command, for example, and the video source will jump from your tablet to the TV in the blink of an eye. I managed to persuade a few friends to come round and help me put the multi-screen feature through its paces. Two tablets, one phone, one person on the TV remote and one goal: to break it. I had everyone jumping from recordings to live TV -- pausing, rewinding, fast-forwarding, flinging, channel surfing and doing everything in between. And, apart from very short buffering times when switching between video sources, which is completely understandable, the system never faltered once. The truth is, I don't have much use for the feature, but I can imagine there are a few families out there fighting for the remote right now that would appreciate it. Everyone going their separate ways to huddle around small screens might not be the most family-friendly activity, but at least everyone gets the same, smooth experience. Like everything else, though, testing out the feature led me to discover one annoying restriction. Streaming HD content, whether live or recorded, is only supported on devices that can process the high-def Freeview MPEG-4 signal directly, none of which I own (most newish Apple hardware does, by the way). Also, I know the multi-screen functionality is intended for getting the most out of your mobile devices, but I don't see why EE couldn't have built an app for PCs and Macs, too. I'm told this is under consideration. While EE TV is the only set-top box on the market that can stream to four different devices, Sky and Virgin do have comparable services, with the benefit of these being you don't have to be connected to the same WiFi network as your box at home. The Sky Go app allows up to two devices (including computers) to stream video over any WiFi or cellular data network -- it's pulling content from the cloud and not your specific set-top box, you see -- or up to four if you pay the piper for Sky Go Extra. You can't get at any of the recorded content on your Sky+ box, but you do have the ability to access premium channels and tons of on-demand content. Virgin Media's TV Anywhere service does exactly the same thing, though the selection of channels and on-demand content is different, and you can only register a maximum of two devices. So, yes, EE TV is the only box that will stream recorded video to mobile devices, but the functionality is far from revolutionary, and you can get similar and arguably better services from other providers. Wrap-up If you look at EE TV merely as a product, then it's got a couple of cool features that make it better than your average DVR. The user interface is well-designed and really fast to navigate, though thinking about the lethargic EPG is enough to keep you awake at night. Replay is something I've used more than I expected to, especially when I've missed the start of a broadcast, but I can't help but want the feature to be available to all channels, not just the ones EE's preselected. The mobile-streaming functionality deserves praise because it works fantastically well. Despite various technical limitations EE doesn't advertise, I can see why people might want to buy this DVR to upgrade their Freeview experience. And therein lies the fundamental problem: You can't just buy it. I was confused about the proposition before I even started using EE TV, and I have to say I still just don't get it. I don't see how people are expected to get excited about the product when it's so inaccessible. You have to be a mobile customer of Orange, T-Mobile or EE (contract or PAYG) and sign up for an EE broadband contract, which means you also need an EE landline. Even if you're an existing customer who fits these criteria, you have to sign up for a new 18-month broadband contract to become eligible to receive a box. I understand the premise: EE TV has some cool features, and being \"free,\" it's an incentive for people to buy into EE's service ecosystem. There's a further lure for mobile data guzzlers, too, as anyone on a 4G EE plan that signs up for broadband gets an extra 10GB or 20GB of data, depending on their current tariff. But, really, does anyone care? EE could throw in a lottery ticket, a pair of sunglasses and a calculator, but none of that is going to stop you from looking at what you're going to be spending each month for your landline, mobile and broadband. Don't get me wrong; EE TV is a capable piece of hardware that's being given away for free, but at what cost? I think consumers are too savvy to pay attention to this dangling carrot, instead focusing on what contracts are going to cost them in the long run. And, after all, it's just a fancy Freeview DVR, not a conduit for any kind of premium content you can't get elsewhere. The box itself is a satisfactory piece of hardware, but the hoops you have to jump through to get one just don't seem worth the hassle, unless all the required EE services happen to be the best value option for you. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Source: EE Origin:Engadget UK Tags: dvr, ee, ee tv, eetv, freeview, hdpostcross, mobilepostcross, netgem, review, set-topbox, uk-feature, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20995330 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20995330\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/ee/tv/\"> EE TV </a> EE TV Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/ee/tv/\" title=\"EE TV reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 0 </a> Prices Discussions Type High def DVR HD recording capacity 600 hours Number of digital tuners 4 Video outputs HDMI (1\u00a0outputs) Announced 2014-10-08 see all specs \u2192 There are not any reviews for this product yet.

Four years later, nothing's changed -- except, perhaps, a few more percentage points of market share. Even then, it's got a long way to go before catching up to Android and iOS. Let's give the company credit for pushing forward, improving its platform and not giving up, though: When I reviewed the last major OS update, I said I could finally use Windows Phone as my daily driver. The one element that Microsoft continued to lack, however, was buy-in from large phone makers. They put more focus on Android products, which meant anyone interested in Windows Phone had a small selection of devices to choose from. For Microsoft, it's time to experiment with a new, simpler approach. The software giant has buddied up with HTC to convert the One M8, its Android flagship, into a Windows Phone. That's all there is to it. There's absolutely no change to the hardware -- and it's a fantastic idea. If it fails, neither company loses much from the deal; since they're using an existing phone, the cost of design and engineering is far lower than it would be on a standalone device. If it's successful, it may inspire other manufacturers to follow suit, resulting in a market with a wide variety of Windows Phones to choose from. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, right?

That's because the HTC One M8 for Windows, as awkward as the name is, is exactly that: an HTC One M8 that happens to run Windows Phone instead of Android. (Why the name omits \"Phone\" is beyond me, however.) The aluminum unibody chassis, 1080p display, Snapdragon 801 processor, BoomSound speakers, 2,600mAh battery, even the UltraPixel Duo Camera setup -- it's all there. It comes with the infrared blaster embedded into the power button as before, and all of the buttons, LED flashes and card slots are all precisely in the same place. In fact, if it weren't for the Windows Phone logo on the back, the hardware would be virtually indistinguishable. Of course, that also means that it's still just as slippery and just as tall as the Android version, so if you didn't like it before, nothing about this phone will change your mind. The version I'm reviewing is the Verizon-exclusive model, which only comes in a gunmetal gray color with 32GB of internal storage (and a microSD slot that handles cards up to 128GB). If Verizon isn't your thing, AT&T announced that it plans to release the device after the exclusivity period is over. HTC's been tight-lipped about whether the phone will eventually head to other markets or carriers. The Verizon version of the M8 for Windows comes with quad-band LTE, which covers both of Verizon's high-speed frequencies and a couple of bands (3 and 7) friendly to many countries in Europe, Africa and Asia. In case the LTE doesn't work when you're traveling abroad, it also comes with quad-band HSPA+ (up to 14.4 Mbps) and quad-band GSM/EDGE. Regardless of where you travel, you're bound to have some sort of connection, even if it isn't incredibly fast. Software It's only when you turn the two devices on that you'll really notice the difference. For the first time since the Palm Treo days, you can choose between two different operating systems running on the same hardware. I want to see more companies try this, but most manufacturers seem wary of dedicating resources to make Windows Phone available on existing Android devices. Of course, this wasn't even an option until Microsoft introduced Windows Phone 8.1 earlier this year, when it announced that manufacturers could take any Android phone they wanted and just slap on the third-place mobile OS instead. (Sadly, Microsoft and Google aren't so keen on letting anyone use both at the same time.) What matters is that it's here now, and Windows Phone flagships are no longer limited to Nokia's Lumia series; it introduces more options for fans of the OS, and it gives the platform more visibility for everyone else. If you've used a Windows Phone before, the user experience will be familiar. HTC tweaks aside (I'll tackle those shortly), the M8 is a Windows Phone 8.1.1 device without a custom user interface. Which makes sense: Microsoft doesn't allow skins. As you'd expect, then, the phone features Cortana, Live Tiles, quick controls, notifications, folders and the new lock screens, among other things. If you've seen one Windows Phone, you've seen them all. The biggest early question about the M8 for Windows was how (or if) it would utilize HTC's homemade software features from its Android skin, such as Zoe, BlinkFeed, Duo Camera capability, Sense TV and Video Highlights. Fortunately, all but Zoe made it into the phone, although there are slightly different implementations for each feature. BlinkFeed on Windows is its own separate app and Live Tile as opposed to a full home screen panel on Android. Ditto for Video Highlights, which takes the form of a standalone app. The camera UI is the same, but only some Duo Camera editing features made the OS jump. Finally, the HTC Dot View case is supported. BlinkFeed feels more at home on Windows Phone than it does on Android, primarily because its interface is tile-based. Its functionality is similar on both platforms: You have access to your social network feeds (yes, including Google+) and a wide variety of highlighted feeds (like Engadget!). At present time, the Windows Phone version doesn't come with a search option or custom feeds, so you'll just have to stick with what HTC offers. It also comes with an active Live Tile that shows the most recent news updates. Video Highlights has been around since the HTC One M7 came out in early 2013. It compiles your photos and videos and combines them into a 30-second highlight reel; you can choose from several different themes (akin to Instagram filters) as well as music, including pre-loaded tracks and selections from your own library. Once the clip is created, you can share it however you want. On Android, the video highlight-creation tool is a part of the Sense gallery app, but here it's a standalone app. The basic setup is the same on both platforms, but their designs match their respective OSes. All told, too, the functionality is the same, though the WP option doesn't appear to have the ability to choose which images or clips to start and end with. Gallery | 34 Photos HTC One (M8) for Windows screenshots + See all 34 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") The on-screen navigation bar is a recent addition to Windows Phone, and a very welcome one, at that (Android has had this functionality for a while). The bar consists of the usual WP buttons like back, home and search. You can choose to have the bar be dark, match the background of the app you're in (which doesn't seem to change too often) or match your accent color instead. It's also possible to hide the bar, in case you're watching a 1080p video or using another app that wants to take advantage of the full screen rather than getting cut off at the bottom. By default, you can press a small arrow on the left side to tuck it away and swipe up from the bottom bezel to bring it back; however, you can choose to disable the button and swipe up for both actions instead. The Dot View case is an optional accessory introduced on the One M8 for Android, but HTC's made it compatible with the Windows Phone version as well. You'll still get the time on top and a symbol for notifications on the bottom, but there's a new feature: Swiping down from the top will activate Cortana, who will begin listening to you without any further action. Unfortunately, this swipe-down functionality isn't available without the case. In fact, the One M8 motion gestures are limited to a simple double-tap-to-wake option; you can't swipe your finger in any direction to take it directly into specific apps. Even worse, the only way to activate the camera is to manually unlock the screen and tap on the Live Tile or go through the Action Center. I'd prefer to have a faster shortcut to the camera for quick access. Camera The M8 for Windows sticks with the same love-or-hate UltraPixel Duo Camera setup as its Android brother, and it even offers a nearly identical user interface. (The only differences are in the settings, which must adhere to Windows Phone UI elements.) In general, HTC's UltraPixel option takes decent pictures and fares well in low-light settings, though shots tend to be less detailed than on other flagship devices. But while the camera modules are exactly the same, a quick image comparison between the Windows Phone and Android versions reveals a few minor disparities. The M8 for Windows seems to do better at capturing dynamic range, and the photos are more saturated in color. The default white balance is also marginally colder. The gap between camera performance widens further in low-light situations, in favor of the Android version. The M8 for Windows produced images that were fuzzier and less detailed than those taken on its counterpart. This may be in part due to the length of time HTC's worked on optimizing its UltraPixel tech on Android versus Windows Phone, and I'm hopeful this can be fixed in a future update. Gallery | 18 Photos HTC One (M8) for Windows sample shots + See all 18 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") For now, one version isn't better than the other in every department; you'll have to pick and choose the factors that are most beneficial to you. If you want the full gamut of imaging options, however, stick with the Android model for now. HTC's signature Zoe feature, which takes a few seconds of video and burst-mode shots and converts it into a Harry Potter-esque moving picture, isn't available; the Zoe app, which is a social network that lets you show off your Video Highlights to friends and family, is also restricted to Android 4.4. Lastly, the Windows edition lacks a few of the M8's Duo Camera editing tools. It comes with UFocus (which lets you change the area of focus), Foregrounder (adds funky visual effects to objects in the background), Dimension Plus (gives the picture a faux-3D feel), rotate/crop tools, most filters and a few frames. Copy/paste, stickers, draw/flip/straighten tools and seasons (a pointless feature that shows leaves, snowflakes, etc. falling down in front of your picture) didn't make the cut, but I rarely use those features on the Android version anyway. Performance and battery life In its early days, Windows Phone earned a reputation for robust performance that has continued to the present. Until recently, the gap in performance between flagships and entry-level devices had been relatively small because Microsoft imposed restrictions on which processors and other specs could be used on the platform; phones like the Nokia Lumia 520 are cheap, but perform well given their limited processing power and RAM. As Microsoft has slowly lifted those restrictions, flagships have now become even more powerful, possessing the same specs as many top-of-the-line Android devices. With the One M8 for Windows, you're going to enjoy all of the same performance benefits as the Android version -- on paper, at least. It has a quad-core 2.3GHz Snapdragon 801 chipset with 2GB of RAM, so it's no slouch. The M8 for Windows runs WP 8.1 Update 1, which is still only available as a Developer Preview on other devices; this is the first time it's been included on a new device out of the box. The M8 for Windows runs well most of the time. To nitpick ('tis my burden and duty), the Android version is a little faster when loading apps and multitasking, primarily due to the time-wasting animations scattered throughout the Windows Phone OS. It's a difference of a couple seconds each time, which likely won't matter at all to most users. Games run smoothly with few to no frame skips, but the same titles on Android were consistently more fluid. Occasionally, the processor on the Windows version would slow down, making games extremely choppy for around 15 seconds, after which it'd smooth out for two or three seconds before returning to its frozen state. A reboot usually cleared up the problem, but I've never run into similar issues on the M8 for Android. I've also noticed that the two 1080p displays aren't calibrated identically; it appears that both devices use different temperatures (the original M8 is a tad warmer), though the brightness and viewing angles are both good. Images and graphics on the Windows Phone model appear to be fuzzier and have less clarity when looking at the two devices side by side, as if they're displayed at a lower resolution somehow, but at least text and games look great. Running benchmarks can be a little tricky when doing cross-platform comparisons, since most Android tests aren't available on Windows Phone. Microsoft's OS was slightly better on internet-based tests like SunSpider (609ms vs. 649ms, where a lower time is better) and Google Octane (2,801 vs. 2,666), while the Android version did better on GFXBench 2.7 (28 fps vs. 19 fps). The latter score is the most concerning, as it's a much larger difference than I'd expect to see on two devices with identical hardware. Compared to the Icon, the M8 does better on Octane and GFXBench but worse on SunSpider and WPBench. So, just like it was on the camera, there's no clear-cut answer to which phone is the better choice. Since the differences are minor, only a few power users may be dissuaded by the results. Battery life is a mixed bag. The benefit in testing identical hardware on competing operating systems is that you can compare the two much more easily and closely study the effect each platform has on power efficiency. In my testing so far, it appears that the WP option is better than the Android version in some ways and worse in others. (My tests are ongoing and I'll continue to add more results as they come.) First, the good news: You can still get through an entire day of normal usage with a little left to spare when you hit the sack. When using the device for email, taking a few photos, browsing the web and running an occasional app, I was able to get slightly more battery life than on my Android M8. When streaming movies through Netflix, the Windows Phone M8 soundly defeats its Android counterpart. Additionally, it lasted for 12 hours and 10 minutes in our standard video rundown test, an increase of 40 minutes over the Sense-clad version. I wouldn't recommend playing games without having a charger nearby, however; titles like Asphalt 8 and Frozen Free Fall (my kids' favorite) drain up to 30 battery percentage points per hour, as compared to around 15 percentage points on the Android M8. (As an aside, both versions of the M8 get hot when playing graphics-intensive games for more than 10 minutes, the point where it becomes uncomfortable to hold.) Finally, the M8 for Windows lasted two hours and 35 minutes in the standard WPBench CPU stress test, in which it forces the processor to work at high intensity. That's pretty typical: The Lumia Icon delivered nearly identical runtime of 2:36. (It scored 2:42 on our initial review, which was on older firmware.) The competition Now that a flagship phone is available on more than one major mobile platform, it's tougher to clearly define its competition; whether you're a fan of Windows Phone, Verizon or nothing more than good phone design, there are plenty of factors to consider. The M8 for Windows is available for $100 on-contract, which is half of what the Android edition cost when it first came out. It may have limited appeal at first because of its exclusivity, but Windows Phone users on Verizon will appreciate it because they can now choose among this and two other flagship devices: the Lumia Icon, which is renowned for its 20-megapixel camera, and the Samsung ATIV SE, which is somewhere between a GS4 and GS5 in terms of specs. The Icon is definitely a well-built phone, but the M8 has more curb appeal thanks to its robust aluminum frame and arched back. Let's go more into specifics on how it compares with the Lumia Icon, its direct Windows Phone competitor. If you're looking for a superior imaging experience, go with the Icon; the M8 is in no way a horrible picture-taking device, but Nokia's had a lot more time and experience to get things right on Windows Phone than HTC has. (And since the Icon still does quite well in low-light situations, the UltraPixel tech isn't quite as persuasive in this case as it may be on Android.) The screen size is only 0.1 inch smaller on the Icon, but the chassis is significantly shorter and much less slippery. HTC offers a great audio experience with BoomSound; the Icon has a hardware shutter button for faster access to the camera; and you'll also need to decide between capacitive buttons and virtual ones. In a way, the M8 for Windows is competing against its Android brother as well, but HTC's goal isn't to cannibalize sales. By adding a second platform, it's allowing HTC to reach a new set of smartphone users without the high cost of designing, developing and producing a brand-new device. I also doubt many people have held off on buying the M8 because it wasn't on Windows Phone, as fans of the platform will have already looked at other options already available to them. Wrap-up This is the first time in years that a user can select a device's hardware and software at the same time; you usually have to choose one and then live with the other. People who already use and love Windows Phone now have a flagship option that isn't the latest Lumia device. This phone won't end the platform wars by showing undeniable proof that Windows Phone trumps Android or vice versa; both devices clearly have pros and cons in different areas, and it ultimately comes down to your personal preference. If your go-to OS is Windows Phone, the M8 is one of the best options, thanks to great design and solid performance. The Lumia Icon still has a bit of an edge, but you'll be happy with either device. If given the choice between M8s, I'd go with the Android version for now because HTC's had much more time, experience and flexibility to get things right on that platform. The performance is a bit more optimized in most cases, and it comes with more of the HTC-branded functionality that makes the One M8 unique.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2015/01/11/sony-xperia-z3-tablet-compact-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "January 11th 2015 at 12:00 pm", "body": " Sony's consumer electronics division is in an ongoing state of flux. Having already given up on PCs and e-readers, the company recently pledged to make fewer TVs and smartphones in a bid to get its books back in the black. How Sony's strategizing will affect its output of tablets remains unclear, but no doubt a keen eye is being kept on the reception of its latest slate, the Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact (don't let that mouthful of a moniker fool you -- Sony only classes the 8-inch tablet as \"compact\" to differentiate it from its two previous 10.1-inch devices). The company is renowned for the quality of its premium products, and like the two smartphones that make up the rest of the Z3 family, its newest tablet is a testament to that legacy. Cutting to the chase, it's an elegant and powerful device, but with prices starting at $445/\u00a3300, those credentials might not be enough to make you choose Sony over the competition. Gallery | 30 Photos Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact review + See all 30 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 74 Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact Pros Thin and light design Stunning display Fast performance Long battery life Cons Expensive compared to similarly sized flagship tablets Sony's Android skin feels dated Poor camera Summary Sony's Z3 Tablet Compact is a well-made, thin and light device with a stunning display, brisk performance and robust battery life. Still, it's difficult to recommend at this price ($445 and up) when there are other thin and light flagship tablets that cost less, many of which offer higher-resolution screens and more capable cameras. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Sony's experimented with quirky devices in the past, but these days it tends to take a distinctly no-nonsense approach to design. Similar to the other members of the Z3 range, the Tablet Compact has a deliberate, square profile, softened only by slight rounding of its corners and sides. Some might call it uninspiring or flat-out boring, but I regard it as stylishly simple. Where other manufacturers might use vibrant colors, clashing textures and a bit of imagination to attract buyers, Sony prefers an IP65/68 dustproof and waterproof rating alongside stainless steel corner guards for extra durability. That's not to say it's completely lacking in design accents. Sony's signature aluminum power key is in attendance, and a purely ornamental dark gray border (silver on the white version) around the perimeter of the device serves to break up the rubbery plastic and tempered glass that dominate the back and front, respectively. Dotted along the edges, you'll find a volume rocker next to the power key, a 3.5mm headphone jack, Sony's magnetic dock connector and a couple of sealed cubbyholes: one for the micro-USB port and another protecting the microSD and nano-SIM slots (the latter only being present on the LTE model, of course). The direction of the two silver Sony logos on either side of the tablet suggests it's meant to be used in portrait orientation. This is even clearer when you consider the high, central position of the main camera on the back of the device, as you have to be mindful of obstructing the lens when taking photos in landscape mode. Previous Z-series slates -- excluding the curious \"tablet edition\" of the Xperia Z Ultra -- have sported an almost symmetrical, picture-frame style of display bezel. With this new 8-inch effort, however, the left and right bezels are slim enough that I can grip the tablet firmly with just one hand. While that sounds convenient, it's actually more uncomfortable than it should be to use it this way. The power key and volume rocker sit central on the tablet's right edge, and directly opposite is Sony's useless proprietary magnetic dock connector. When I'm grasping the slate with one hand, then, these features are in just the right spot to rub and scratch at my skin. Aside from this design oversight, the tablet is a joy to use, mostly because it's only 6.4mm thick (0.25 inch) and weighs 270g (9.5 ounces). That's even thinner and lighter than the latest iPad mini, which comes in at 7.5mm (0.29 inch) and 331g (11.7 ounces). The Z3 Compact is perfectly balanced and light enough that you can easily suspend it between your paws for extended periods of time without fatiguing; in fact, it's the only tablet I've used that hasn't had me wishing for a case to prop it up in right out of the box. An unavoidable side effect of being so thin and light is that the tablet also feels a tad... delicate. Now, the device does bow to my twisting and flexing tests a little more than I'd like, but even then, I'm content with the overall build quality. In other words, I wouldn't choose to make it sturdier at the expense of size or weight. Also, the Z3 Tablet Compact is fully waterproof, after all, so it's not like Sony's thrown this together using spare parts and a roll of duct tape. Display and audio The Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact is decked out with an 8-inch, 1,920 x 1,200 IPS LCD display (283 ppi). In simpler terms, that means it has a full HD (1080p) screen with a few pixels left over for accommodating the standard Android navigation keys. As is Sony's way, the tablet's graced with several of the company's display technologies, including Triluminos and X-Reality for richer colors and sharper images. Forgetting the trademarks, the panel is, quite simply, gorgeous. Colors are vivid; whites are accurate; and blacks are basically as good as they can be for an LCD display. Viewing angles are excellent, and the panel can also claim fantastic sunlight readability. On a nice day, you'll still get a modicum of glare coming off the glass, but the screen burns bright enough to be easily visible even in strong, direct sunlight. I didn't expect much from the tablet's stereo speakers. The only clues as to their whereabouts are two slivers of missing plastic above and below the display glass, and I can't say these narrow grilles look particularly functional. I guess it was inevitable that I would be pleasantly surprised, however, given my low expectations. Sound is well-defined, even if it is restricted to the middle and top end, and the speakers kick out more than enough volume to annoy everyone in your train carriage. At approximately 75 percent of maximum volume, though, the tablet begins to vibrate and audio loses all sense of clarity as distortion takes hold. The speakers could be way better, and any semblance of bass whatsoever would be appreciated, but there are also worse ways to watch an episode of your favorite show in bed. Having had the pleasure of reviewing the excellent Xperia Z3 Compact, I had a hunch the Tablet Compact would be a different animal once a set of headphones was plugged in; and I wasn't wrong. Through headphones, audio is crisp and perfectly balanced, with a healthy bass range to get your head bobbing. There's all manner of technology working away in the background to make sound output as good as it is, such as an audio-resolution upscaling engine, but all you need to concern yourself with is what you want to watch or listen to next. The tablet supports several high-resolution audio formats, too, if you happen to have a particularly fancy digital music catalog. Software The Z3 Tablet Compact is running Android 4.4.4 KitKat for now, but Sony expects to upgrade the slate to Lollipop (Android version 5.0) in early 2015. Hopefully it won't just be an under-the-hood upgrade, as the company's custom skin could do with an overhaul, too. It's familiar and comfortable enough, as it doesn't stray too far from the stock Android experience, but it could use refining in the same way Z-series hardware has been subtly nipped and tucked over the generations. At this point, it's almost too colorful and cartoony, given the business-like appearance of Sony's devices themselves. The firm has something of an ongoing love affair with bloatware that could do with being scaled back, for example. Out of the box, you need to spend a moment clearing the Z3 Tablet Compact's home screen panels of unwanted widgets and shortcuts, before setting it up how you actually want it. The overly cluttered app drawer? Well, that's something you just kinda have to put up with, which isn't a huge deal if you make good use of the home screen carousel. Still, having several different gallery apps and various music and movie players could easily be avoided. You can forgive Sony for preloading its own tablet with homegrown services -- of which there are many -- like Video Unlimited, the Lifelog activity tracker and the PlayStation app. I'm less magnanimous, however, when it comes to more obvious bloatware like the OfficeSuite, AVG antivirus, Kobo, QR code reader and Garmin navigation apps. Thankfully, these are all uninstallable, so they can be easily purged if they're of no use. Beyond the general verdict that Sony's Android skin is at least intuitive to use, there are a couple of nifty features that also deserve a mention. The baked-in screen-recording function that's accessed via the \"shutdown menu\" (which pops up after holding down the power key for a second) is neat, even if you don't see yourself using it. Also, the Z3 Tablet Compact supports PS4 Remote Play, meaning you can use it as a wireless screen for your home console as long as both devices are connected to the same WiFi network. Both smartphones in the Z3 series are also capable of this, but it makes way more sense on the tablet due to its significantly larger display. Camera Sony's Xperia Z2 Tablet plays host to a pretty underwhelming pair of cameras, and unfortunately for those hoping for better this time around, the Z3 Tablet Compact is kitted out identically. I doubt you'll care much that Sony hasn't bothered upgrading the 2.2-megapixel front-facing shooter. I've made many a Skype call on the device with no complaints regarding picture quality from the other end, and I guess if you absolutely have to take that opportunistic selfie, you'll just be glad to have a shooter on hand. I understand that cameras just aren't a priority for tablet makers. The smartphone photographer is a much more demanding breed of user, whereas a tablet camera is more of a functional asset -- it's there for when you need it. Still, the quality of the 8.1-megapixel camera with its Exmor RS backside-illuminated sensor on the Z3 Tablet Compact is almost inexcusable, especially as Sony expects you to spend the better part of 500 bucks for the privilege. Gallery | 24 Photos Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact sample shots + See all 24 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Whether you're using the manual or \"Superior auto\" setting, which, incidentally, restricts image resolution to six megapixels, photos rarely come out how you want them to. All cameras typically do their best work in situations with plenty of natural light, but even under these conditions, images from the Tablet Compact are frequently washed out, overexposed and lacking realistic color representation. Every now and again, you'll be surprised by the quality of a picture, but only because the previous five have been a disappointment. If there's one compliment you can bestow on the Z2 Tablet's camera, it's that it isn't as bad as the one on the Z3 Tablet Compact. Since they use the same hardware, I can only conclude that the sensor hasn't been calibrated properly in the newer slate. It simply can't deal with artificial light, with the auto-white balance setting struggling the most. Low-light performance is a little better. Sometimes images are knowingly overexposed to jack the brightness up a tad at the expense of contrast and color, which isn't unusual in mobile devices. When this doesn't occur, though, you're left with a dark, grainy image -- the kind you won't care to share unless filtered and hashtagged accordingly. As you'd expect, video performance isn't markedly different, with 1080p clips suffering in the same way stills do. The autoexposure setting tends to be commendably consistent, but focus often stutters and the quality of the video itself is lacking. And that's when you're framing a static shot; start panning around and it's like watching a flipbook your eyes can't keep up with. I'm certain I could've achieved better quality photos more consistently had I begun digging into the endless menus of Sony's camera app, but that's just not my style. Out of all camera software, that's why I prefer the stock Android app. It takes care of everything for you, and though you could argue Sony's \"Superior auto\" mode is comparable, the fact that I have the option to tweak settings means I'm always mindful I could be squeezing something better out of the lens. I flat-out dislike Sony's take on the camera app due to the infinite number of settings available. I imagine even a pro photographer would quickly tire of the cumbersome, disjointed menu system, regardless of the deep level of control it seems to offer. Alongside the manual and \"Superior auto\" modes, there are various other camera \"apps\" available on the device and to download. Some are potentially useful, like the YouTube live-broadcasting mode, Evernote plug-in and \"Timeshift burst\" feature, which lets you select from a set of images taken before and after you hit the shutter release. Others are there to inject a little fun into the proceedings, such as the augmented reality camera apps that overlay virtual objects and critters onto your images. And some of your photos are bound to be so bad that you'll want to hide them behind dinosaurs and ninjas. Performance and battery life The Z3 Tablet Compact might look starkly different compared to last year's 10.1-inch Z2 Tablet, but hardly anything has changed when it comes to the key specs. You're still looking at 3GB of RAM and a quad-core Snapdragon 801 chipset with Adreno 330 GPU, albeit clocked at a slightly higher speed of 2.5GHz. There are a couple of reasons the core internals are nigh on identical. For one, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 801 SoC is basically as good as they come; and secondly, it's got more power than you realistically need in a tablet. Games like Asphalt 8: Airborne run dreamily on the highest graphics settings, so if you're partial to the odd session of [insert game of choice here], know that it'll run as well on the Tablet Compact as it would on any other top-tier device. It should go without saying, since the tablet handles processor-intensive 3D games without a hiccup, but if you need confirmation: The general user experience is super-slick, too. Whether you're swiping furiously through the home screen or app drawer panels, or taking care of the basics like checking email and browsing the web, the Tablet Compact never misses a beat. It's a high-end device with a price to match, and that's most certainly reflected in the performance stakes. When it comes to connection protocols, the Z3 Tablet Compact supports practically everything you can think of: dual-band WiFi (up to 802.11ac), Bluetooth 4.0 LE, NFC, GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, ANT+, WiFi Direct, Miracast, MHL 3.0, DLNA and various other, more obscure acronyms. In addition to the two WiFi-only configurations with either 16GB or 32GB of onboard storage, there are two models with nano-SIM slots for tapping into Cat 4 LTE networks (maximum download speeds of 150 Mbps). I've been testing out the SGP621, which supports LTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17 and 20. Thus, it's the model most suitable for European and North American markets (though it won't work on Sprint's 4G network), while SGP641 is the SKU for Asia, with support for LTE Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 28 and TD LTE Band 40. You're not limited to data traffic on the LTE variants, by the way, meaning you can use the Z3 Tablet Compact as a comically oversized phone if you're so inclined (or have no other choice). Battery life is easily one of the standout features of both the Xperia Z3 and its miniature counterpart. The Z3 Tablet Compact is no different. While the slate's 4,500mAh battery isn't oversized for an 8-inch tablet, it lasted between 13.5 and 14 hours in our standard looping-video rundown test from a full charge (I ran it a few times to be sure I was getting an accurate result). To put that into perspective, that's among the best results any tablet's ever achieved. In real life, you're looking at more like 10 hours of continuous use, since you'll be losing efficiency by doing more than simply watching a locally stored video for over half a day. Battery life drops dramatically if you're doing more processor-intensive tasks, of course. I used it frequently over the holiday period to Skype with relatives and friends, and I estimate you could stay on a call for around three to four hours from a full charge. If the slate is destined to sit on your coffee table for the majority of its tenure, though, it'll turn out to be one of those devices you forget to charge for days on end, because you simply don't need to. The competition Right now, you can pick up a 16GB WiFi-only Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact in the US for $479 on Amazon, or \u00a3300 through Amazon's or Sony's online UK stores. It really isn't worth springing for the 32GB configuration at $500 or \u00a3349 when a 16GB microSD card can be found for significantly less than the mark-up, but if you require LTE connectivity, you're looking at roughly $545 or \u00a3399. It goes without saying, then, that this isn't exactly a cheap tablet, and it's hard to justify the price when you can find perfectly good products like Amazon's Fire HD 6 for $99/\u00a379. The Z3 Tablet Compact is in a completely different league, of course, especially when it comes to computing power, but then it depends on what you're going to do with your slate. Plenty of folks would be better off choosing a much cheaper tablet if browsing, emails and social networking are their primary concerns. At the higher end of the spectrum, there haven't been too many notable releases since the Xperia Z2 Tablet was launched in early 2014. Of the devices that have comparable screen sizes to the 8-inch Tablet Compact, the strongest competition comes from Google's Nexus 9, Apple's iPad mini 2 or 3 and Samsung's 8.4-inch Galaxy Tab S. The Nexus 9 is the newest of the trio, and runs Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box. It's a tad heavy, but with a high-res display, decent battery life and excellent performance, it's not a bad device for the $399 asking price. The iPad mini 3 is also $399 for the 16GB configuration, and is a great little tablet all-round, though the $299 iPad mini 2 is arguably a much more attractive option if iOS is more your bag. The 8.4-inch Galaxy Tab S is currently selling for $340 at Expansys, making it the cheapest of the lot. It's thin, light, powerful and carries a gorgeous 2,560 x 1,600 display. If you haven't noticed the theme here, let me spell it out for you: The Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact is at least $80 more expensive than its closest competitors. And the real problem is that I wouldn't consider it to be necessarily better than any of the products mentioned. Each device has its flaws and killer features, so obviously personal preference comes into play when you're deciding what tablet's gonna suit your needs best. But, it's kinda hard to justify the extra expense when the Z3 Tablet Compact doesn't have an obvious edge. Wrap-up Sony's Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact is a lovely piece of hardware. It's light on flair, has a borderline-terrible camera, mediocre stereo speakers and a slightly tired Android build. On the flipside, though, it has a fantastic display (even if it is only a 1080p panel), outstanding performance and long battery life. Maybe I'm just boring, but the facet I like most is how thin and light the tablet is. I haven't really wanted for a new slate since I picked up a discounted OG iPad mini many moons ago. While I've been using the Z3 Tablet Compact, I've grown to adore how... compliant it is. For me, its size and weight are the most impactful features, but therein lies the problem. There are other thin and light tablets. Some have higher-resolution screens; others are beautifully designed; and all are cheaper than the $479 Z3 Tablet Compact. A high waterproof rating doesn't justify such a high price, and I shouldn't really be complaining about things like camera performance for that kind of dough, either. I've had the luxury of using the featherweight tablet for an extended period of time -- enough to fall in love with its petite profile -- but I haven't had to drop a cent for the pleasure. While I'd be happy to add one to my gadget repertoire, I simply can't bring myself to drop nearly 500 bones on a tablet that doesn't stand out enough from the crowd. If it were cheaper, maybe -- but for now, I'll stick with my two-year-old iPad mini, thanks. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: mobilepostcross, review, sony, sony xperia, sonyxperia, uk-reviews, xperia, xperia z3 tablet compact, xperiaz3tabletcompact, z3 tablet compact, z3tabletcompact \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21123800 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21123800\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/sony/xperia/z3/tablet-compact/\"> Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact </a> Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact Buy from $418 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/sony/xperia/z3/tablet-compact/\" title=\"Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Tablet Operating system Android Screen size 8 inches Storage type Internal storage (Flash) Camera (integrated) 8.1\u00a0megapixels Announced 2014-09-03 see all specs \u2192 10average user rating Features 8 Display 8 Battery life 10 Ease of use 10 Storage capacity 10 Design and form factor 10 Portability (size / weight) 10 Durability 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $418.00 + tax & shipping Buy now 2 What's the best (cheap) tablet for seniors?

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/22/imac-with-retina-display-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "October 22nd 2014 at 10:00 am", "body": " When Apple held one of its big keynotes last week, it was easy to think of it as \"iPad day.\" Sure enough, the company announced some upgraded tablets, but it was a desktop, of all things, that stole the show. Though the new 27-inch iMac with Retina display has the same overall design as Apple's previous all-in-ones, it ushers in a 14.7-million-pixel 5K display with screen resolution of 5,120 x 2,880. That's seven times as many pixels as 1080p, and 67 percent more than you'll find even on a 4K panel. I'm not exaggerating when I say there's nothing like it. As it is, you'd be hard-pressed to find a 4K all-in-one, and meanwhile, here's this machine from Apple, with enough pixels to view a 4K video at full resolution, and still have room left onscreen for other stuff, like the Final Cut Pro dashboard. Needless to say, it's in a league -- and price class -- of its own. Starting at $2,499, it's more expensive than almost any other all-in-one on the market, even the supposedly high-end ones. As it turns out, though, if it's this kind of screen quality you're after, this might well be your only choice. Gallery | 28 Photos Apple iMac with Retina display review + See all 28 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 93 Apple iMac with Retina display Pros Best-in-class 5K screen offers bright colors, wide viewing angles Fast performance Attractive design Robust audio Cons Expensive compared to other all-in-ones Can't be used as a secondary display Summary The iMac's 5K Retina display puts it in a class of its own, though with a starting price twice that of rival machines, it's not for everybody. We mainly recommend it for photo and video enthusiasts, especially people who couldn't otherwise justify the cost of a Mac Pro and a standalone 4K monitor.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Look and feel I'll make this part quick. With the exception of that gorgeous 5K screen, the Retina display iMac has the same design and dimensions as the regular 27-inch model, which came out back in 2012. As ever, the bezel measures just 5mm thick, making for one thin screen. Of course, you won't notice the slim frame unless you view it from the sides. And besides, the rest of the machine isn't nearly as skinny -- the desktop still puffs out behind the display where all the components live, and you'll need to budget enough room on your desk to fit a machine that measures 25.6 inches wide. The metal stand in the back naturally adds to that footprint, though Apple smartly put a keyhole in there to allow for tidier cable management. Throughout, the machine is fashioned out of the same smooth aluminum as the MacBook line, making for a premium design. All in all, I dig the aesthetic here, and always have. When Apple first unveiled it two years ago, though, I was adamant that thin bezels alone weren't a good enough reason to buy a new iMac. I still feel that way, though there have always been other reasons you might want one. In this case, that stunner of a display. That's an excellent excuse to spend twice as much on an all-in-one as you normally would. Speaking of the sort, I promise I'll get to the display in just a minute. First, though, let's go over the ports, just to be thorough. All of the ports and openings are located on the backside toward the bottom, with everything arranged in a neat row. This includes a headphone jack, SDXC slot, four USB 3.0 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 sockets and a Gigabit Ethernet jack. There's also a Kensington lock slot and the all-important power port, which is located right behind the stand, making it easier to just thread the power cable through the keyhole. One thing you won't notice are the speakers, but believe me, they're there -- two of 'em. Specifically, Apple squeezed them into the chambers on either side of the screen, with the sound firing downward through the lower bezel. For a sound setup you can't even see, it's actually quite robust. Finally, the iMac ships with the same, old wireless keyboard, along with your choice of an Apple Mouse, Magic Mouse (gesture-enabled) or Magic Trackpad. As ever, the keyboard is comfortable to type on, if a tad flat, and I like the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad equally. You can't go wrong with either, though you can also buy both for an extra $69 if you're worried about missing out. Display \"I just wanna stare at it.\" That's what a colleague said when he first saw the Retina iMac, and even now that I've been playing with it for a few days, I feel the same way. The best way I can describe it is this: Unboxing it is kind of like setting up your first HDTV. I didn't want to do anything for the first few minutes; I just wanted to swap in new desktop backgrounds, each sharper than the last, and see how many details I could pick out. Even the flat new icons in OS X Yosemite look great, but you're probably going to need some 4K video or high-res photos if you want to make the most of the screen. (I imagine the photo and video enthusiasts this machine is aimed at will have that on hand anyway.) If you can get yourself some nice test pictures, maybe a few shot by professionals, you'll notice extraordinary detail in everything from leather to reptilian skin. Macro shots, in particular, are about as close as you can get to feeling like you're looking out a window. (\"That's not OK,\" a different colleague said as I showed him this image of an eyeball.) Given the right image, one with accurate colors and impeccable sharpness, there's little separating that collection of pixels from the real thing. But it's not just the resolution that makes this a best-in-class display -- the image quality is also top-notch. For starters, Apple used Oxide TFT (thin-film transistor) technology to keep the brightness even throughout the 27-inch panel. Apple also added a so-called compensation film for viewing angles. Indeed, colors stay pungent even from severe off-angles -- unrealistically wide angles, I mean. The truth is, though, that the last two years of iMacs had wide viewing angles as well, with relatively little glare, so whatever Apple did here, it feels more like it fine-tuned an already-excellent display. Ditto for the colors: They're vivid and lifelike, but then again, I said the same thing about the last generation of iMacs. Additionally, Apple borrowed the same \"organic passivation\" technique it uses on its Retina iPads, which has a positive effect on both image clarity and power consumption. Speaking of the sort, Apple says this model uses 30 percent less power than the previous-gen of iMacs, which is important because no one wants a display this pixel-dense to overheat. Behind it all, there's a custom Apple-designed timing controller chip to tell each pixel what to do. All told, my biggest complaint about the display is that you can't use it as a second screen. While some earlier iMacs could work as standalone monitors, the 5K iMac is designed to be used as an all-in-one only. Unfortunately, too, there's currently no standalone 5K Cinema Display, though I wouldn't be surprised if one were in the works. For now, though, that means if you already own a new Mac Pro and want a super-sharp display to play back 4K content, you'll need to look to other brands.

And you do want to know how that $2,499 machine performs, don'tcha? Of course you do. For the purposes of my review, I tested the entry-level model, which comes with a 3.5GHz quad-core Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 1TB Fusion Drive and a 2GB AMD Radeon R9 M290X GPU. In general-performance benchmarks like Geekbench and Xbench, I saw a slight bump over last year's iMac, which ran on a slightly lower-clocked Intel Core i5 processor and a different GPU. Meanwhile, on Cinebench, my OpenGL test, results rose slightly from 80.18 frames per second to 90.54 fps, while the CPU score saw a slight increase from 525 to 540. At the same time, because both of my test units had a Fusion Drive combining a 128GB SSD with a 1TB 7,200RPM hard drive, things like disk speeds and startup times were roughly the same. This time around, for instance, I got average read speeds of 659 MB/s compared with 668 MB/s, and write speeds of 311.5 MB/s versus 318.1. Not a big difference. It's a similar story with the boot-up: It took about 15 seconds here, compared with 13 the last time around. Very similar results, all around. Read speeds Write speeds 1GB 665.15 MB/s 315.53 MB/s 2GB 666.71 MB/s 310.79 MB/s 3GB 655.09 MB/s 309.14 MB/s 4GB 651.65 MB/s 309.01 MB/s 5GB 656.34 MB/s 312.99 MB/s But enough about benchmarks -- let's talk about 4K. I mean, that's what this machine was built for, right? And how. To put the new iMac through its paces, I loaded up Final Cut Pro with around 10 gigabytes of 4K video clips, and then got to work editing. Much like the newest Mac Pro, which came out last year, the Retina iMac has enough horsepower that you can quickly add effects to 4K files in Final Cut Pro, even while the file is playing back. Whether it was the \"camcorder\" effect or a black-and-white filter, I saw my clips transform immediately, with no wait time and no pause in the playback. Speaking of the sort, to ensure smooth playback, I enabled a setting in Final Cut Pro that causes the clip to pause when a frame drops. I'm happy to say the playback never actually paused. Oh, and in case you're wondering, it took four minutes and 53 seconds to export that 10GB project as a 1080p file, optimized for Apple devices. I have nothing to compare that export time to, but I will say that's the only time the iMac ever got noisy. Not loud, really, but I could definitely hear the fans start to kick in. Aside from performance potential, that's one of the bigger differences between this and the higher-end Mac Pro: The Pro stays whisper-quiet under even heavier loads. Though the Retina display iMac wasn't built for gaming, specifically, I decided to try my hand anyway. After all, a $2,499 machine with discrete graphics should be able to turn in a respectable showing, ya know? In any case, it is indeed respectable. Even at native resolution (5,120 x 2,880), I got frame rates of up to 26 fps (average of 22 fps) in the three-year-old Batman: Arkham City. That's with details and anti-aliasing both set on medium. Once I turned off anti-aliasing and dropped the resolution to 4,096 x 2,304, the average frame rate climbed to 34 fps. At 3,200 x 1,800, it jumped to 52 fps. And at 2,560 x 1,440 -- the same resolution as most other high-end all-in-ones -- the game purred along at 78 frames per second. Again, I'm not saying the iMac is a gaming phenom, but the fact that it's playable at resolutions not even offered on other all-in-ones bodes well for the graphics muscle. What's that? You'd prefer to play at max settings? Let's be real: You're probably not seriously considering buying this anyway. Software The Retina display iMac arrives alongside OS X Yosemite, Apple's latest desktop operating system, which became available to the general public last week following a large beta program. If you're interested in every painstaking detail, you really should read my review, but in case you don't wanna open another article right now, I'll do my best to condense everything into a few hundred words. Basically, the most important thing you need to know is that while OS X will run on any relatively recent Mac, you'll need an iDevice of some sort to make the most of the operating system. With this latest update, you can make and receive calls on your Mac, as well as send and receive text messages, and use your iPhone as an auto-connecting hotspot. You can also start using an app like Pages on your mobile device and pick it up on your computer, or vice versa. Likewise, you can remotely open and close Safari tabs on your iOS device, as well as view your entire iCloud search history. To do any of this, though, you need an iPhone, or maybe an iPad or iPod touch. In some cases, too, you need to be using Apple's own apps, like Safari or Mail, instead of third-party ones like Gmail. If, like many users, you own an Android phone, or use Google Drive or OneDrive for cloud storage, many of the best new features will be useless to you. For those people, the main appeal will be the much-improved Spotlight search, some new Mail features (if you even use the Mail app) and a flat, iOS-inspired design. And even that has been a source of controversy among the Mac faithful. Then again, why grouse? It's a perfectly fine operating system, and besides, it's not like you even have a choice: If you buy the new 5K iMac, this is what you're going to get. Configuration options The Retina display iMac starts at $2,499 with a 3.5GHz quad-core Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 1TB Fusion Drive and AMD Radeon R9 M290X graphics with 2GB of GDDR5 video memory. From there, you've got a few upgrade options. On the CPU side, you can step up to a 4.0GHz quad-core Core i7 chip to the tune of $250. You can increase the RAM to either 16GB ($200) or 32GB ($600). For $250, you also have the option of adding a beefier GPU (the AMD R9 M295X), which comes with four gigs of VRAM, not two. Finally, let's talk storage. For the same starting price of $2,499, you can get a 256GB SSD instead of that 1TB Fusion Drive. Alternatively, you can choose a 3TB disk ($150), a 512GB solid-state drive ($300) or a 1TB SSD ($800). Do you have $800 to spend on a 1TB SSD, by the way? Well, then. I'm jealous of you. The competition If you ask Apple, the Retina display iMac's main competition doesn't necessarily come from other all-in-ones, but rather, standalone 4K displays. It's a fair point: Dedicated monitors sometimes run thousands of dollars, and that's without a full computer inside. As I've already said, though, this is a slightly misleading argument, since the 5K iMac can't be used as a secondary display. So, if you already own a powerhouse machine and just want a stunning monitor to go with it, then the iMac's price is irrelevant; you're still going to have to pay market value for a 4K screen. Speaking of which, not all 4K and Ultra HD displays are created (or priced) equal. You could, for instance, buy the 32-inch Sharp PNK-321 for $4,795 (though current prices are hovering around $3,600); Dell's forthcoming 5K display, which will cost $2,500; or ASUS' 31.5-inch PQ321Q, which has a list price of $3,000 (with several retailers offering it for around $2,100). But they're not all that expensive. On the other side of the spectrum, there's the 28-inch Dell P2815Q, which has 4K resolution (not 5K) and goes for $600, before any instant-sale pricing. Similarly, Samsung's 28-inch U28D590D also costs $600, and has an identical resolution of 3,840 X 2,160. In any case, Apple's marketing people are probably correct that the best-quality 4K displays cost thousands of dollars, but you definitely don't need to spend three grand for a monitor with that resolution. And what if you do want an all-in-one with a 4K display? How much is that gonna cost? Obviously, if you're dead-set on Mac OS, this is your only option -- that is, unless you're willing to settle for the regular iMac, which has either 1,920 x 1,080 or 2,560 x 1,440 resolution, depending on whether you get the 21.5 or 27-inch model. Across the aisle, in the world of Windows PCs, it's slim pickings, unfortunately -- at least if you want a screen anywhere close to the Retina iMac's. Dell's XPS 27 starts at a lower price of $1,600, but its 2,560 x 1,440 resolution falls short of 4K, let alone the 5K Apple is offering. Ditto for the ASUS ET2702IGTH and Lenovo's 27-inch A730 all-in-one, which is said on the company's site to be \"coming soon\" with a 2,560 x 1,440 screen. Over at HP, meanwhile, the highest-end desktop you can find is the $1,400 Envy Recline 27, and even that tops out at 1080p resolution. So yes, the new iMac is \"expensive,\" in the sense that it costs more than its rivals. But you're also getting a much sharper screen, one that belongs in its own league. Seriously, those other models don't even come close. Wrap-up The Retina display iMac is the best all-in-one desktop you can buy right now, and yes, the $2,499 seems fair, considering the amazing display. That said, precisely because it's twice as expensive as some rival machines, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. There are casual users -- web surfers, Facebookers -- who will be perfectly satisfied with the regular iMac, which starts at $1,099. But for people who are serious about their photos, and serious about their videos, this new model is in a class of its own. There's simply nothing else like it -- no other 5K all-in-one, not even a 4K machine that would come sort of close. In particular, I'd recommend this to someone who couldn't quite justify the Mac Pro, which starts at $2,999 without a monitor. Even the entry-level, $2,499 Retina iMac handles 4K video editing smoothly and remember, you don't have to pay extra for a super-high-res screen. Now, if you already own a Mac Pro and want that 5K display, well, the best you can do is look on with envy -- and hope Apple gets around to releasing a standalone 5K Cinema Display sooner rather than later.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/21/amazon-fire-hd-6-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "November 21st 2014 at 12:00 pm", "body": " Here's a question: How did Amazon know it was time to make a $99 tablet? Because of focus groups? Its ace marketing department? Close: user reviews. Let's not forget that Amazon is best known for its retail empire, so when lots of people start buying cheap tablets, the company catches on quickly. And when shoppers start giving them lousy user reviews, well, Amazon notices that too. After reading lots of write-ups from disgruntled customers about tablets with chintzy build quality, the company decided it could do better. The Fire HD 6, a 6-inch tablet priced at $99, is the company's cheapest and smallest slate yet, and it's designed to take on all those unreliable no-name devices that shoppers seem to hate so much. Suffice to say, it offers some great value for the price. Here's why. Gallery | 22 Photos Amazon Kindle Fire HD 6 review + See all 22 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 82 Amazon Fire HD 6 Pros Sharp screen Long battery life Useful features such as family sharing and the option to add six user accounts Great overall value for the price Cons Heavy for its size, cheap build quality Limited built-in storage, no microSD slot Some performance lags Doesn't include Amazon's Mayday live support feature Summary With long battery life, a sharp screen and some useful software features, the HD 6 offers impressive value for the money. It's an excellent choice for children, and anyone else looking for a small-screen tablet on a budget. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware There are lots of reasons you might buy the HD 6: screen quality, interesting software, long battery life. But an attractive design isn't one of them. The HD 6 is a chunky and surprisingly heavy little thing, measuring 0.4 inch thick and coming in at 10.1 ounces, or 0.63 pound. To put that in perspective, the Nexus 6 weighs just 6.49 ounces, or 0.4 pound, though it's about as thick as Amazon's tablet. Aside from its boxy shape and chamfered edges, the HD 6 has a plain shell fashioned out of smooth plastic (my unit came in white, but you can also get it in black, magenta, cobalt blue or \"citron,\" a loud yellow). Around the edges, you'll find a volume rocker and power key, but sadly no microSD slot -- a shame since there's only 8GB or 16GB of built-in storage. There's also a 2-megapixel camera around back, capable of shooting 1080p video, along with an even lower-res VGA camera up front for the occasional selfie. In any case, prepare yourself for a good deal of corner-cutting here. This is a $99 tablet, and it looks the part. That said, what the Fire HD 6 lacks in charm, it makes up for in durability. Up front, the 1,280 x 800 screen is coated in Gorilla Glass, making it less vulnerable to scratches. Amazon also ran its new tablet through a gamut of torture tests, ranging from sunscreen to salt water to a machine that simulates items being tossed around inside a bag. I confess I haven't tried the sunscreen test myself, but I did frequently put the tablet inside a backpack alongside other gadgets, and to this day it doesn't have any scuffs on either the front or back side. Speaking of the screen, Amazon sets itself apart with a 6-inch, 1,280 x 800 panel, which equates to a respectable pixel density of 252 ppi. That's actually the same resolution as Amazon's 7-inch tablet, except there, the pixel density drops to 216 ppi -- something to consider if you're deciding between the two. More importantly, you're going to be hard-pressed to find another tablet in this price range that matches the HD 6 in sharpness; most of the other cheapies top out at 1,024 x 600. That makes a difference in just about every area that matters: watching movies, browsing photos, playing games and reading books. Unfortunately, though, the viewing angles are mixed, and that's despite the fact that this makes use of an IPS panel. On the one hand, I had an easy time viewing the screen while reading, checking email, surfing the web and updating Facebook -- basically, anything that required me to be holding the device in two hands, not far from my face. When I was lying on the couch, though, trying to watch a movie, there was no way to rest the tablet against my legs and still be able to follow along (not without turning all the lights off, anyway). Ultimately, I needed to keep at least one hand on the device to maintain an optimal viewing angle. Let me tell you: After one hour of that, I was ready to return to my Roku Streaming Stick, and stream Amazon Prime Video on my TV instead. All of which is to say, if you think you might do a lot of movie-streaming, consider buying one of Amazon's optional case-stands, which start at $30. On the audio front, the HD 6 makes use of Dolby's Digital Plus technology, which Amazon uses in most of its other tablets (the high-end Fire HDX 8.9 uses Dolby Atmos instead). That means the 6- and 7-inch Fires should offer similar sound, except the 7-inch version has stereo speakers, while the 6-incher makes do with just one. Keep in mind, I haven't tested the new HD 7, so it's impossible for me to compare. But I will say this: The sound coming from the 6-inch model is pretty weak. I had to crank the volume close to the top, even when I was sitting alone in a quiet room. It's not like the tablet had much to compete with, but I still had to go up around the max volume mark to listen comfortably. Even then, I had to make sure not to rest the tablet face-up on my couch or other soft surfaces; because the speaker sits on the backside, the sound can muffle easily if you obscure the grille in any way. On the bright side, at least, the quality could have been much tinnier than it was. That may sound like faint praise -- and it kinda is -- but I actually enjoyed listening to Jimi Hendrix on this tiny thing. Sure, the lower notes could have come through stronger, but all in all, the audio was still more pleasant than I expected it to be. Software With the Fire HD 6, Amazon also introduced a new version of Fire OS, codenamed \"Sangria\" (Amazon names its operating systems after alcoholic beverages the way Apple used to name its OSes after large jungle cats). Based on a forked version of Android KitKat, Fire OS 4 brings a fresh, easy-to-understand UI. On the home screen (pictured above left), you'll see a carousel showing all your most recent... stuff. Apps you just opened? Books you recently read? It's all there, in one continuous string. Basically, it's the closest thing you have to a multitasking tool, since the usual button in Android for seeing open applications isn't included here. Fortunately, at least, this setup works. Anytime I closed out of an app, maybe to check email or look up something online, I was able to quickly get back to where I was by tapping the home button, followed by one of the shortcuts in my \"recently used\" carousel. Below that, you'll see a smaller carousel whose contents change depending on which app or file you've selected in the main one. For instance, if I swing the larger carousel to a memoir I recently read, I'll see similar book recommendations listed below. The only time this doesn't happen is when you select certain native apps -- things like the built-in camera. From there, swipe up and you'll see that the rest of the screen is taken up by a grid of apps. If you're coming from a plainer version of Android, then you're used to opening a dedicated app launcher, but the setup here is just so convenient that you just might get accustomed to it anyway. Finally, at the top of the screen you'll see tabs for individual categories including games, apps, books, music, videos, newsstand, audiobooks, web, photos and \"shop.\" As you'd expect, tapping on any of those will allow you to see everything you own in that category, even if it's not recent. And yes, at every turn you'll find links to the Amazon store. How else is Amazon supposed to make money off such a cheap tablet if you don't buy anything on it? In addition to a new layout, Amazon introduced a few new features as well. This includes the ability to add up to six user accounts (two adults and four kids), making it ideal for family use. In a similar vein, a new \"Family Library\" feature lets you share books, apps, games and videos with someone else in the house -- maybe a spouse who has their own Amazon account. Speaking of the sort, Amazon baked in some robust built-in parental controls, including the ability to decide which apps kids can use and when. Separately, Amazon has a \"FreeTime Unlimited\" service ($3 a month for Prime subscribers; $5 for non-members), which offers unlimited streaming for videos, books and movies aimed at ages three to eight. Additionally, Amazon brought over the Firefly feature it introduced on the Fire phone. That lets you scan items using the built-in camera and then, you know, buy them. Amazon also added \"ASAP\" (Advanced Streaming and Prediction), a feature that first debuted on the Fire TV. In brief, it's designed to predict what you're going to watch next on Amazon's streaming service and start preloading it in the background to avoid buffer times. Gallery | 53 Photos Fire OS 4.0 \"Sangria\" screenshots + See all 53 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") As with Amazon's other recent products, there's Goodreads integration, so that when you rate a book in Amazon's Kindle Store, you're also rating it on the social network too. Another oldie-but-goody: X-Ray, which serves up information from IMDb to tell you more about whatever movie, show or audio track you happen to be playing. For instance, if I'm watching Scandal and Olivia Pope and President Fitzgerald Grant are having a tryst, I'll see a notification in the upper-left corner of the screen saying that Kerry Washington and Tony Goldwyn are in the scene. At any time, I can click through to learn more, at which point the video will pause while I look stuff up. For music, meanwhile, you'll see the lyrics as you listen to the song. Lastly, there's the Amazon Appstore. This is important because, unlike a proper Android tablet, you won't have the luxury of accessing the Google Play store. Fortunately, at least, Amazon's app store is now at a point where it has a very well-rounded selection. Speaking from personal experience, I was able to find most of my favorites, including Facebook, Twitter, OneDrive, CNN, The New York Times, Spotify, Pandora, Slacker, Mint.com and others. The only one I wanted that I couldn't find was Dropbox. I'm sure you'll be missing a few too, but on the whole, Amazon has most of the big names taken care of. All told, Fire OS 4 reads like a greatest-hits list of Amazon's best features, but there are in fact a couple things missing. First of all, Amazon didn't include its Mayday live support feature, which you'll find on the Fire phone and Amazon's higher-end HDX tablets. Also, the reliance on Amazon's own apps and services feels a bit tedious after a while. I get as a tablet running a forked version of Android, the HD 6 might never be eligible to run Google-certified apps, like Gmail or the Play Store itself. But for Pete's sake, is Amazon Cloud Drive really the only option for storing documents? Who among us would have used Amazon Cloud Drive before purchasing an Amazon tablet? Performance and battery life Amazon Fire HD 6 Google Nexus 9 Samsung Galaxy Tab S** NVIDIA Shield tablet Quadrant 2.0 6,681 13,737 18,597 20,556 SunSpider 1.0.2* (ms) 663.1 948.3 1,109 463 3DMark IS Unlimited 10,346 24,256 12,431 30,970 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan Offscreen (fps) Unable to run 31 5.5 31 *SunSpider: Lower scores are better. **Average scores for the 8.4- and 10.5-inch models. The HD 6 chugs along on an unspecified quad-core 1.5GHz processor and 1GB of RAM. It's certainly not terrible, especially for a tablet at this price, but don't expect any miracles either. Though it's perfectly fine for simple things like email, e-books, web surfing, Facebook, Twitter and movie-watching, there's still a faint sluggishness throughout. You'll notice it when you hit the menu in the upper-left corner, and the tablet pauses for a second before the menu eventually flies out. Ditto for the onscreen keyboard -- I often noticed a delay after tapping a text field with my finger. Occasionally, too, the paltry RAM allowance became an issue -- I couldn't run a certain graphics test in GFX Bench, for instance, because the device didn't have enough memory. Would it have killed Amazon to throw in another gig of RAM, especially if it was already resigned to selling the hardware below cost? That said, the HD 6 managed to turn in a better SunSpider score than the Nexus 6, 2014 Moto X or the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, suggesting that the built-in Silk web browser is more than capable of keeping up with your web-surfing habits. Really, I think part of the reason I'm being so picky is that I've used higher-end devices, and I know what a fast tablet feels like. For a first-time buyer, though, or maybe a child, it'll probably matter less. Tablet Battery Life Amazon Fire HD 6 11:14 Microsoft Surface 2 14:22 iPad Air 13:45 (LTE) iPad mini 3 13:45 Apple iPad mini 12:43 (WiFi) Samsung Galaxy Tab S (10-inch) 12:30 Samsung Galaxy Tab S (8-inch) 12:22 Apple iPad mini with Retina display 11:55 (LTE) iPad Air 2 11:15 Amazon Fire HDX (7-inch, 2013) 10:41 Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 10:04 Acer Iconia W4 9:50 Google Nexus 9 9:10 Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet 7:57 Nexus 10 7:26 Dell Venue 8 Pro 7:19 Nexus 7 (2013) 7:15 Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 7:13 The HD 6 is rated for up to eight hours of \"mixed use,\" according to Amazon's product page, but in fact, I got quite a bit more than that. With a movie looping, the screen brightness fixed at 50 percent and WiFi on, but not connected, I got an incredible 11 hours and 14 minutes of runtime -- almost exactly what we saw from the much bigger iPad Air 2. So how does Amazon pull it off? Clever software settings, mostly. In particular, Amazon has a feature called Smart Suspend that creates a device-specific profile for when the tablet is not in use. Additionally, when the software detects that the tablet is idle, it automatically turns wireless off, a tweak that can result in up to 25 percent more standby time, according to Amazon. Configuration options The Fire HD is available in 8GB and 16GB editions, with and without \"special offers,\" or ads on the lock screen. For the 8GB model, the starting price is $99 with those advertisements, and $114 without. If you go for the 16GB version, the price climbs to $119, or $134 ad-free. Additionally, there's that slightly larger HD 7 I mentioned earlier. That starts at $139 with special offers (8GB), and goes up to $154 without. (There's also a 16GB model for $159, or $174 ad-free.) Sorry, guys, I'm not quite done overwhelming you with pricing info. Bear with me for just a minute. Amazon also sells a Kids Edition of both the HD 6 and HD 7, which comes with a rubbery case and a two-year, no-questions-asked warranty covering any and all accidents. These start at $149 for the 6-inch model and $189 for the 7-incher. Both have 8GB of storage, with no 16GB option. So why the higher price, you might ask? Well, the warranty, but also this: There are no special offers here. For the best, if children are going to be using it -- why expose them to needless ads? The competition As for everything else on the market, well, the HD 6 has quite a few big-name competitors, even at the $100 level. There's Lenovo's A7 tablet, which starts at $95 with 8GB of storage, and also has a 1,280 x 800 screen and quad-core processor (MediaTek in this case). Acer's Iconia One 7 also has a 1,280 x 800 panel, and though it's technically priced at $130, Amazon itself is selling it for $100. HP's also got a $100 Android tablet, but it's held back by a 1,024 x 600 screen and shorter, 5.5-hour battery life. It's a similar story with Toshiba, whose $99 Excite Go tablet also has a lower-res 1,024 x 600 display. Finally, ASUS' last-gen MeMO Pad 7 has seen a price drop to $100, but you're probably better off paying $24 extra on Amazon.com for ASUS' newer model. I could name even more options, but I think you get the idea: The Fire HD 6 has competition, but the screen quality and possibly battery life are going to be superior in most cases. As for everyday performance? Not necessarily. Even then, though, the HD 6 is still adequate for basic tasks. Given all that, the main question you need to answer is: Are you comfortable locking yourself into Amazon's ecosystem, or do you need access to the Google Play store? If plain Android is more your speed, you'll want to save that short list of options I just gave you. But let's not limit ourselves entirely to Android, even if the HD 6 does run a forked version of KitKat. As prices for Windows tablets continue to fall, I'd suggest you consider a couple of those too -- the number of apps in the Windows Store is steadily growing and meanwhile, you can install regular desktop programs as well. As a disclaimer, I haven't had the chance to test any of these, but that being said, the $100 HP Stream 7 looks the most promising: It packs a Bay Trail-series Intel Atom processor and 32GB of storage, and has the same 1,280 x 800 resolution screen as the Fire HD 6 and 7. Wrapping up, there's also the $105 Toshiba Encore Mini, but be warned that it has 16GB of built-in storage, not 32, and the display is lower-res than the Stream 7's. Wrap-up I hesitate to call the Fire HD 6 the best tablet you can buy for $99, but that's mainly because I haven't had the chance to test them all. What I can say, unequivocally, is that Amazon's newest tablet offers tremendous bang for your buck, including long battery life and a relatively sharp screen that makes it ideal for watching movies and reading books. And while some people will still prefer an Android tablet with full access to the Google Play store, Amazon's Fire OS is easy to navigate and includes useful features like family sharing, parental controls and the ability to add up to six user accounts. Also, for anyone afraid of being locked into Amazon's ecosystem, the company does at least have a broad range of content; that includes music, movies and books, of course, but even its app store now offers many of the same big-name titles as Google Play. If anything, I want to warn people not about the operating system, but the limited storage -- the tablet has at most 16GB of space, and there's no microSD slot in the event you need more room. It's also heavy for a device this size, though still eminently portable. All that said, though, the HD 6 remains a strong choice, especially at this price. I recommend it for people with kids, or anyone who's been searching for a decent budget tablet. You really can't go wrong with this one. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: amazon, amazon fire hd 6, amazonfirehd6, fire hd 6, firehd6, mobilepostcross, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20993404 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20993404\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/amazon/fire/hd-6-inch/\"> Amazon Fire HD 6-inch </a> Amazon Fire HD 6-inch Buy from $114 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/amazon/fire/hd-6-inch/\" title=\"Amazon Fire HD 6-inch reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Tablet Operating system Android Screen size 6 inches Storage type Internal storage (Flash) Camera (integrated) Yes Announced 2014-09-17 see all specs \u2192 10average user rating Features 0 Display 10 Battery life 10 Ease of use 0 Storage capacity 0 Design and form factor 0 Portability (size / weight) 0 Durability 0 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $114.00 + tax & shipping Buy now No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/21/nokia-lumia-930-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "August 21st 2014 at 9:30 am", "body": " Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia is now bearing fruit, but as often happens when big companies merge, there aren't enough jobs to go around. More than 10,000 former Nokia employees are due to be laid off by the end of the year, but their legacy will live on for a time in the Lumia 930: one of the last all-Nokia creations. If you live in the UK, then you already know where to get the flagship Windows Phone, but the more important question is whether you want one. We've already taken a deep dive on the 930 in our review of the Lumia Icon, which is essentially the same phone, just exclusive to Verizon in the US. Let's revisit the good, the bad and the competition. Gallery | 15 Photos Nokia Lumia 930 review + See all 15 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 87 Nokia Lumia 930 Pros Top specs with strong performance to match Excellent display Fantastic camera Good battery life Cons Lacking in standout design features Premium price Summary The Lumia 930 is arguably the best Windows Phone on the market, with a brilliant camera and top-end specs. It's also an improvement over the US version, the Lumia Icon, thanks to broader LTE band support and a free wireless charger in the box.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") The Lumia 930 won't leave many wanting when it comes to raw specs, but it could leave the more design-focused buyer a tad underwhelmed. It's a fairly inconspicuous marriage of Gorilla Glass 3, aluminum and polycarbonate, with the latter adding a dash of Lumia color to brighten up the proceedings. If you're not a fan of Nokia's more playful, plastic-clad models, then the 930's utilitarian look might be right up your alley. The aluminum band spanning the perimeter of the phone is a nice reminder you're dealing with a top-end device that deserves a dose of premium materials. A slight pillowing of the back panel makes the 930 comfortable to hold, and with a 5-inch display, it has much more agreeable dimensions than the 6-inch Lumia 1520. The smaller device is still relatively heavy at 167g (or sturdy, depending on how you look at it), but well within most people's tolerances. Nokia Lumia 930 Dimensions 137 x 71 x 9.8mm Weight 5.89 oz. (167g) Screen size 5.0 inches Screen resolution 1,920 x 1,080 (441 ppi) Screen type OLED ClearBlack; sunlight readability enhancement; high brightness mode; Gorilla Glass 3 Battery 2,420mAh Li-Ion (non-removable) Internal storage 32GB External storage None Rear camera 20MP Zeiss, OIS, f/2.4, wide-angle lens, AF Front-facing cam 2MP sensor (1.2MP stills) Video capture 1080p/30 fps (rear); 720p (front) NFC Yes (with secure element on SIM) Radios LTE Bands 1, 3, 7, 8, 20 GSM: (850/900/1800/1900) HSPA: (850/900/1900/2100) Bluetooth v4.0 LE SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 (MSM8974) CPU 2.2GHz quad-core GPU Adreno 330 RAM 2GB Miscellaneous FM radio, GPS/GLONASS, micro-USB 2.0 HS, four-mic setup WiFi Dual-band, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wireless Charging Yes, Qi standard Operating system Windows Phone 8.1, Lumia Cyan The Lumia 930 launched already running Windows Phone 8.1, but the Icon, its US doppelganger, was built before Microsoft eased up on design requirements with the release of 8.1. As a result, the 930 is probably the last phone you'll see with capacitive navigation keys and a physical camera button alongside the standard power and volume rocker arrangement. Undoubtedly, one of the best bits of the external hardware is the 5-inch display: a 1080p AMOLED ClearBlack panel nestled under a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3. It's hard to fault, what with its great sunlight readability, viewing angles and color saturation. You can check out our Windows Phone 8.1 review if you're unfamiliar with what the latest update to Microsoft's mobile OS brings, but the biggest features to note are the addition of a notification center and virtual assistant Cortana. The latter is still in beta in the UK, but that in itself means we shouldn't be far from a consumer-friendly release. Aside from the two main highlights that make for a much more competitive OS, the keyboard now supports swipe-based typing, and there are various other improvements to the core experience, like a new battery saver mode and redesigned calendar app, among others. Being a Lumia, the 930 also reaps the benefits of Nokia's Cyan update on top of Windows Phone 8.1, which includes enhanced Camera, Creative Studio and Storyteller apps. Packing the heaviest hardware in Nokia's lineup, the 930/Icon and 1520 get some special treatment, like the Living Images photo feature that creates multi-frame moving pictures. Then there are the improvements to sound-recording quality when shooting video, as well as color temperature, low-light capture and autofocus when using the camera in general. On the imaging front, the 930 has a more-than-capable 20-megapixel PureView camera with f/2.4 aperture. It's not quite on the level of the Lumia 1020, but it's also not as inferior as the raw specs would suggest. Low-light performance is especially good, and Nokia's Camera app allows you to tweak deeper settings like white balance, ISO and shutter speed straight from the viewfinder -- things you may actually find yourself doing on a mobile with such a large sensor. While picture quality may be impressive, video is of a slightly lower standard. The overly skittish autofocus noted in our Icon review is much improved with Windows Phone 8.1, but auto-exposure compensation is still somewhat overactive. The audio that accompanies the video is basically as good as it gets, thanks to four microphones that focus on the sound in front of the lens and while canceling out what's behind it. There's nothing negative to be said about the overall user experience. Windows Phone is designed to run smoothly on super-cheap hardware configurations, so with a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 and 2GB of RAM to work with, the 930 does it better than any. All that power isn't at the expense of running time, though, and the 2,420mAh battery will keep the 930 chugging along happily for at least a full day, even with intensive use. You can also juice it up wirelessly thanks to an integrated Qi coil -- every 930 comes with a wireless charger in the box, too, which isn't the case with the Icon. Incidentally, the Icon also doesn't support any form of LTE roaming, making it well and truly a Verizon-exclusive handset. The 930, on the other hand, works on bands 1, 3, 7, 8 and 20, which should take care of all needs, foreign and domestic. For now, the Lumia 930 is simply the top of the pile when it comes to Windows Phone handsets, and with flagship status comes flagship pricing. Unlocked, you can currently pick up a 930 for \u00a3395 in the UK, but search around and you'll find the Apple iPhone 5c, HTC One M8, LG G3, Samsung Galaxy S5 and Sony Xperia Z2 all within roughly \u00a350 of that price. As Verizon called dibs on the Icon, it's unlikely we'll see US carriers ranging the 930 any time soon. That said, if you're keen on the 930's wider LTE frequency support, unlocked models are available on Amazon from around $580.\nChances are you might not want to pay up front for the handset in the UK, and should you journey the contract route, there's almost no delineation in prices across the top handsets. For around \u00a330 per month, you're free to pick your poison. And if your poison happens to be a top-spec Windows Phone with unmatched performance, a great display and a camera that's practically as good as they get, well, prepare to get very sick indeed. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: 930, lumia 930, lumia930, mobilepostcross, nokia, nokialumia930, review, smartphone, uk-feature, uk-reviews, windowsphone8.1 \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20949402 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20949402\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/nokia/lumia/930/\"> Nokia Lumia 930 </a> Nokia Lumia 930 Buy from $359 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/nokia/lumia/930/\" title=\"Nokia Lumia 930 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 10 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Windows Phone Screen size 5 inches Internal memory 32 GB Camera 20\u00a0megapixels Talk time 3G (up to 15.5 hours) Dimensions 5.39 x 2.8 x 0.39 in Announced 2014-04-02 see all specs \u2192 9.4average user rating Reception and call quality 9.8 Display 9.8 Battery life 8.6 Camera 9.8 Ease of use 9.4 Design and form factor 9.6 Portability (size / weight) 9 Media support 9.4 Durability 9.8 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 8.2 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $359.99 + tax & shipping Buy now 2 Why is Microsoft so stupid? 0 Nokia Lumia 930 Overheating Issue and atrocious service.

That might make it sound like it's the third iteration in a line of gadgets, but really, it's the first. That's because even though this is Sony's third smartwatch (fourth if you count the Sony Ericsson LiveView), it's actually Sony's first that comes with Android Wear. Both the original SmartWatch and the SmartWatch 2 ran Sony's own proprietary platform, which, while Android-friendly, didn't have nearly the same reach as Google's Android Wear. It's great that Sony has finally seen the light, but the SmartWatch 3 has arrived remarkably late to the party, letting rivals like Motorola, LG and Samsung gain ground. On the other hand, the SmartWatch 3 is currently the only Android Wear option with a built-in GPS radio, allowing for more precise workout tracking. Which, as it turns out, could be enough to help Sony stand apart from the pack. Gallery | 31 Photos Sony Smartwatch 3 review + See all 31 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 76 Sony SmartWatch 3 Pros Built-in GPS is ideal for runners and other athletes WiFi and NFC make this more future-proof than other Android Wear devices Relatively long battery life Display is easy to read in direct sunlight Cons Drab design Screen isn't as vibrant as on some other smartwatches Not many Android Wear apps currently make use of the GPS, WiFi or NFC Summary Sony's latest smartwatch won't be for everyone, what with its dull design and muted screen. Still, this is currently the only Android Wear device with a built-in GPS radio, making it a smart choice for runners and other athletes interested in tracking their pace and distance. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware While some Android Wear watches like the Moto 360 and the ASUS ZenWatch make attempts at being stylish, Sony's SmartWatch 3 seems to have given up that notion entirely. Its square watch face, in combination with a rubber strap, definitely gives it more of a sporty, utilitarian look than a fashionable one. Worse still, the band that encapsulates the watch makes the 1.6-inch display seem larger than it is. Indeed, while the bezel surrounding the screen is relatively small, it appears so much thicker when worn in the strap, giving it an unfortunately chunky appearance. Yet, the fit is not altogether uncomfortable. The flexible strap is coated in what feels like a soft-touch velveteen material, and the weight of the core watch unit is only 39 grams (with the strap, it's about 66 grams). It's relatively easy to take on and off thanks to a simple metal clasp, which you can adjust to fit the size of your wrist. The watch might jostle around a bit when you're running, but on the whole I found it pleasant enough to wear on a daily basis. The SmartWatch 3's wrist strap comes in a few different colors: white, black, pink and green. To swap them out, simply push the watch unit out of its rubber enclosure; it should pop out without much effort. That's easy enough, but this does mean that the SmartWatch 3 isn't compatible with standard 22mm straps, so you're stuck with whatever bands Sony offers. Unlike a lot of other smartwatches, Sony's latest doesn't need a proprietary charging dock or cradle. It actually has a micro-USB port housed right in the watch itself, over on the backside, covered by a removable rubber stopper. Though portable charging docks generally contribute to slimmer and more streamlined designs, I actually really like that the watch has this built-in port. If it means not having to carry around yet another thing with me when I travel, I'm all for it. I do recommend popping the watch out of its rubber strap before plugging in the charging cable, however, because it's rather awkward otherwise. If you want the watch to survive a dunk in the pool, you should definitely keep that micro-USB port sealed. Once covered though, the SmartWatch 3 is IP68-rated for dust and water resistance, which means it can withstand submersion in up to 4.9 feet of water for 30 minutes. That's a touch better than the IP67 rating for most other watches like the Moto 360 and the LG G Watch R, which can supposedly be submerged in up to a meter (3.28 feet) of water for half an hour. Though you'll be doing most of your navigation via the watch's touchscreen display, the SmartWatch 3 does have a physical button on the side for when you need to quickly wake it up (or put it back to sleep). You can also hold it down as a shortcut to the Settings menu. The button sits slightly above the surface of the strap and has a nice give when pressed. Internally, the SmartWatch 3 makes use of a rather beefy 1.2GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor along with 512MB of RAM, plus 4GB of built-in storage so that you can load it with apps and music from Google Play. Other sensors include an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a compass. Of course, it also has Bluetooth, which you can use to pair with your phone, or connect to a set of headphones. As I noted earlier, the SmartWatch 3 is also the first Android Wear device to have built-in GPS, which I'll return to in much greater detail in just a moment. It's also said to have WiFi and NFC capabilities on board, but as Android Wear doesn't quite support those two functions just yet, I wasn't able to test them. Still, it's comforting to know that the SmartWatch 3 is future-proof in this regard -- something I can't say about most earlier Android Wear devices. Display While the design of the SmartWatch 3 might not exactly dazzle you with its style, its display is something else. It's not round like some of the fancier Android Wear options and it's a hair smaller too, but its clarity more than makes up for it. The 1.6-inch screen has a 320 x 320 resolution, which amounts to a pixel density of 283 ppi, making it one of the sharpest panels you'll find on any Android Wear device. I had no problems reading text, even on such a small display. I did, however, find the colors to be a bit muted and the whites to be a little yellow. Suffice it to say, it's not quite as stunning as the OLED screen we saw on the LG G Watch R. In exchange for some dull colors, though, a transflective LCD screen makes the SmartWatch 3 easy to view in direct sunlight. I left it on auto brightness most of the time, and thanks to the ambient light sensor, I was able to tell time and find out what song was playing with a quick glance, regardless of how bright it was outside. Like most other smartwatches, the SmartWatch 3 packs an internal accelerometer that lights up the screen whenever you lift it to meet your eyes. This, however, takes a second or so longer than I would like. Normally, this isn't a big deal, but when I was out and about, running errands, it got a little annoying.\nIn use In a sign that Sony is finally coming to its senses, the SmartWatch 3 is blessed with Android Wear and not some proprietary Sony operating system like its previous smartwatches. That means if you've read any of our reviews of previous Android Wear devices -- or maybe even own one yourself -- you probably already know how to use the SmartWatch 3. But perhaps you could use a refresher, so here's a brief primer. You'll need an Android phone to get started (obviously), at which point you'll need to download the Android Wear application. From there, it's just a matter of pairing the watch with the phone by following the onscreen instructions. Interestingly, I wasn't prompted at all to install any additional software like some of the other Android Wear watches (the Moto 360, for instance, requires Motorola Connect, while the ZenWatch wants you to have the ZenWatch Manager installed). As for navigating the watch itself, here's how it works: From the default watch face, you can swipe down to reveal the date, battery life information and gain quick access to mute, Theater Mode (where it shuts down the display) and the settings. Whenever you get a notification, you can swipe up take a peek, and then swipe right to dismiss it or left to get a further look at it. Pressing down on the default watch face lets you swap out different watch styles. It's all fairly intuitive and you should have no problems navigating it if you're at all familiar with smartphones. If you'd rather not go through the trouble of finger-swiping, you can also give voice commands thanks to the watch's built-in microphone. Simply say, \"OK Google,\" and it'll bring up a short list of eligible voice commands. You can tell it to do all kinds of things, like set a reminder, send a message or find directions, and it'll do so. Voice recognition can be a little spotty -- I sometimes had to repeat myself once or twice -- but it worked pretty well most of the time. As I mentioned up top, the most distinguishing feature of the SmartWatch 3 is that it's the first Android Wear device with built-in GPS. This is a very important feature for runners, who often like having GPS in their watches to track their distance, route and pace. In previous Android Wear devices, you still had to lug your phone around with you in order to get that geolocation data, which can be a pain if you want to run with as little burden on you as possible. The SmartWatch 3, on the other hand, lets you keep track of your run completely phone-free. Of course, this only really works if you use a running app that taps into the built-in GPS function of Android Wear. There aren't too many of these available right now, but thankfully one of the more popular ones, RunKeeper, updated its app to take advantage of it. I simply downloaded RunKeeper on my phone and it automatically synced the app to my watch. I then left the office to go on a brief walk, leaving my phone safely in my desk drawer. Before I took off, I told the RunKeeper app on the watch to start tracking the workout, and it did. When I came back and reconnected the watch with my phone, it automatically transferred the route, along with the pace and distance information, to the RunKeeper website. In short, the SmartWatch 3's GPS function works as advertised, and I can imagine it being a popular feature among runners and joggers. While the SmartWatch 3 also has a pedometer for counting steps, it curiously doesn't have a heart rate monitor like on the Moto 360 or ASUS ZenWatch. We've had mixed experiences with these optical heart rate sensors in the past, but omitting it completely in a supposedly sports-oriented watch seems like a big oversight. That said, the fact that the SmartWatch 3 includes two other uncommon features (WiFi and NFC) could make up for it. We just have to wait for the supported apps to arrive. Performance and battery life With a 1.2GHZ quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor along with 512MB of RAM, the SmartWatch 3 performs beautifully. I experienced little to no lag when navigating around the watch, and voice commands took no time at all to register. As I mentioned earlier, the accelerometer did seem a little slow to act when attempting to light up the watch with an elbow raise, but on the whole, performance was good. Battery life, however, is where the SmartWatch 3 really shines. It packs in a 420mAh battery, which is the biggest battery we've seen yet in an Android Wear watch. The rated longevity is somewhere around two days. In practice, I found this to be mostly accurate. I left notifications on for Twitter, Facebook and my calendar appointments; used GPS to track the occasional walking route; listened to a few songs on repeat (which I loaded onto the watch via Play Music); and used voice commands extensively throughout the day. The watch kept trucking along for about a day and half before it started begging to be plugged in. When I switched over to Airport Mode and kept the display off for the rest of the day, it lasted almost a full 48 hours. Under what I'd consider moderate to heavy use, that's quite impressive.\nThe competition The smartwatch space is getting increasingly competitive, which makes it all the more important for newcomers like the SmartWatch 3 to stand out. Thankfully, it does. It's certainly not as stylish as the Moto 360, LG G Watch R or ASUS ZenWatch, and it doesn't have the sort of unique circular display you'll find on the first two. At $250, the SmartWatch 3's price is priced on par with the competition too; the 360 and G Watch R cost $250 and $299, respectively, while the ZenWatch rings in at a more affordable $200. But what the SmartWatch 3 lacks in style, it makes up for in features. It has built-in GPS, which is great for runners and outdoor enthusiasts, and other goodies like WiFi and NFC mean that the SmartWatch 3 is far more future-proof than any of the other Android Wear devices on the market. Further, its battery life is relatively good, lasting a whole day longer than rivals like the ZenWatch and the Moto 360.\nWrap-up Sony's SmartWatch 3 certainly isn't for everybody. It's dull compared to its rounder, sexier rivals; its strap is made out of rubber rather than leather; and the display is not as bright or vibrant as others. But if you care more about function than form, the SmartWatch 3 suddenly looks a whole lot more interesting. For runners in particular, built-in GPS is a great feature that lets you leave your phone at home. It also has WiFi and NFC, making it more future-proof than the competition. It also eschews the need for a charging dock thanks to a built-in micro-USB port and has a battery life that makes it one of the longest-lasting smartwatches on the market. No, you shouldn't get the SmartWatch 3 if you want a watch to impress people at a cocktail party. But if you want one that's more suited for fitness, this is absolutely worthy of consideration. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android wear, androidwear, mobilepostcross, review, smartwatch, SmartWatch 3, smartwatch3, sony, sonysmartwatch3, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 21123267 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_21123267\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android-wear/\"> Google Android Wear </a> Google Android Wear Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android-wear/\" title=\"Google Android Wear reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Type Mobile / embedded OS Source model Open Released 2014-07-07 see all specs \u2192 7average user rating Ease of use 8 Speed 4 Configurability 2 Ecosystem (apps, drivers, etc.) 10 Openness 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 0 Moto 360 Pricing 0 Smartwatch that keeps the calendar locally? 2 Best Must Have Apps For Android Wear Talk about the Google Android Wear with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/sony/smartwatch/3/\"> Sony SmartWatch 3 </a> Sony SmartWatch 3 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/sony/smartwatch/3/\" title=\"Sony SmartWatch 3 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 2 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Other Operating system Android Screen size 1.6 inches Storage type Internal storage (4 KB, Flash) Released 2014-11-11 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Features 10 Display 8 Battery life 10 Ease of use 8 Storage capacity 9 Design and form factor 8 Portability (size / weight) 9 Durability 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 2 What running apps works with the GPS? 0 Smartwatch/Fitness band for snowboarding 2 Is the display Gorilla glass?

Smartphones with big screens (phablets, to some) are now ubiquitous, but it all started with an odd device called the Samsung Galaxy Note. At 5.3 inches, it was a behemoth for its day -- and yet, it sold like hotcakes thanks to its unique S Pen stylus, which provided users with extra functionality, and a copious amount of screen space. Four iterations later, the Note series has continued to grow, mature and dominate the genre. Not only does the latest version, the Galaxy Note 4, come with the snazziest spec sheet on the market, but it also ushers in a fantastic new direction in Samsung's design. It sure sounds like an improvement over last year's model, and it is. Now that Apple's ready to tackle the Note with a large-screen phone of its own, however, is Samsung's baby still the best in its class? Gallery | 63 Photos Samsung Galaxy Note 4 review + See all 63 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 90 Samsung Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Pros Gorgeous design with high-end materials Nice display Best camera in a Galaxy smartphone Powerful performance Great battery life Cons Isn't waterproof\u00a0 Loudspeaker still needs work Summary Not only is the Note 4 the best Samsung smartphone I've ever used, but it's also the best large-screen phone on the market -- even better than the iPhone 6 Plus.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware In my review of the Galaxy Alpha, I declared it was the most beautiful Samsung phone I'd ever seen. Thanks to the company's love of consistency, the Note 4 uses the same overall design and is just as aesthetically appealing as its smaller sibling. Its predecessor, last year's Note 3, was a big step in the right direction, featuring a bigger screen and fashionable leather-like back. But it wasn't enough. The ribbed chrome sides, the pointless stitches and the larger-than-life connector port at the bottom made it look cheaper than it needed to be. The Note 4 resolves those problems with aluminum sides, chamfered edges and smooth curves, and has a much more elegant appearance as a result. Only the sides and edges of the Note 4 are aluminum, while the remainder of the phone is built with polycarbonate. And that's OK. Samsung's been opposed to using metal of any kind in its phones for years, and building a device with aluminum on the sides and plastic on the back is a solid compromise that makes it plenty durable. After all, most all-metal phones don't come with removable backs, and that's one of Samsung's biggest strengths; for as long as I can remember, the company has allowed users to swap batteries and add external storage via microSD slots underneath the back cover. Now you can have the best of both worlds. Fortunately, Samsung pulled off this new design without adding much bulk. It's 2.3mm taller, 0.6mm narrower and 0.2mm thicker than the Note 3 and, at 176 grams, it's also 8g heavier. Slightly noticeable when the two devices are compared side by side, perhaps, but otherwise a wash when it comes to the in-hand experience; I probably wouldn't be able to pick out which one was which if I were blindfolded. The Note 4 isn't the most comfortable large-screened phone to hold with one hand, but it comes in second place. That title rests with the LG G3, a 5.5-inch device with an arched back and thin sides that help it rest naturally in my hand -- it doesn't feel as large as it really is. That said, the new Note has an even bigger screen and I can still hold the device without hand fatigue (in which my hand gets tired after holding the phone for a while) or accidentally dropping it. I can't say the same about the Note's new competitor, the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus; with a large bezel, rounded sides and a slippery aluminum build, it's tougher to hang onto with one hand than the Note. The only drawback to holding Samsung's new device is the edges, which feel a tad sharper when I wrap my fingers around them. Of course, it's still big. Not everyone will like the fit and feel, simply because it is indeed a large handset. There's not much Samsung can do to remedy that, although it manages to trim down the Note's width with each new iteration. But for what it is, the product is reasonably sized. On the front, there's an LED indicator on the top left, proximity sensors next to the earpiece in the top center and a 3.7-megapixel selfie cam placed in the top right. You'll also get a home button doubling as a fingerprint sensor, which is very easy to press because it's slightly raised above the glass; this is flanked by two capacitive keys (recent apps and back). Just like the sides they're affixed to, the volume and power buttons (on the left and right sides, respectively) are also fashioned out of aluminum, and match up with the industrial design very well -- plastic buttons would've looked awfully out of place. The 3.5mm headphone jack and IR sensor (for remote control functionality) are on the top, and a micro-USB port sits in the middle of the bottom side, while the S Pen holster rests closer to the corner. Curiously, the micro-USB connector is 2.0, which is technically a step down from the 3.0 socket found on the Note 3. While this means your data transfers won't be as fast via cable, it also looks a lot cleaner; the port on the Note 3 was bigger, unsightly, took up too much space and, let's face it, was never used to its full potential. It feels odd to say, but this is one time I'm happy to see Samsung go back to an older protocol. Unfortunately, the fact that the port is open, rather than sealed shut like it is on the Galaxy S5, shows that the Note 4 is not waterproof. When I first saw the Note 4 in September, I took a quick glance at the bottom and immediately thought the entire back was curved. After a moment, I realized that I fell victim to a design trick: The top and bottom of the frame have curves that give the device extra sleekness, but the bed of the phone on which the back cover rests is ever-so-slightly raised above the frame and is still completely flat. The Galaxy S5 was the first Samsung device with a built-in heart rate monitor on the back, housed below the camera module and next to the LED flash. The Note 4 does the same, but it adds extra sensors for ultraviolet rays and blood oxygen levels. There's also a mono speaker grille in the bottom-left corner; I'm not sure why it wasn't just built into the bottom of the phone, like it is in the similarly designed Galaxy Alpha or even last year's Note 3, but I suppose it's at least consistent with how it's positioned on the GS5. Underneath the back cover are the microSD and micro-SIM slots (not nano-SIM, like many competitors are using now), along with the 3,220mAh battery. If the design has any flaws, it's in the space between the front glass panel and the edges. Some of the first Note 4 owners in other parts of the world report that the phone has a small gap, large enough to fit the edge of a business card. There's certainly some truth to this: Samsung officially commented on the matter, stating that the issue doesn't affect the functionality or quality of the device. I personally couldn't find a big enough gap in my review unit to stick a business card in, though I managed to squeeze a thin piece of paper into one spot on the left side. Your mileage will likely vary depending on where and when you get your device, but I didn't find it to be as huge a problem as it was made out to be.

This means you'll get to enjoy a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 on a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED screen, equaling 515 ppi in pixel density. Obviously, it's a much higher number than the Note's 386 ppi, 1080p display. It's hard to say no to more pixels, especially on such a large device, but you're not missing out on a vastly improved viewing experience if you don't get the new phone -- the old Note's screen was quite lovely already, after all. The Note 4 panel is subtly better, with slightly crisper text and sharper image quality, but again, you're not going to notice a drastic improvement over the last version unless you're looking at them side by side (which, let's face it, rarely happens). Of course, increases in display resolution mean more pixels to power up, so Quad HD screens aren't exactly energy efficient. The good news is, as you'll see later, that Samsung has found a way to compensate for that issue without having to use a significantly bigger battery. So, go ahead and enjoy the fantastic viewing angles, high outdoor visibility and extra details, all while shrugging at Samsung's use of color saturation (you can't say the company isn't consistent) without feeling like it's going to shut off any second. Speaking of high outdoor visibility, if you're outside and having trouble seeing the screen, switch the phone to auto brightness; doing so allows the phone to push out as much as 750 nits, which is a lot brighter than any other phone I've used (and a far cry from the max brightness when you change it manually on the Note 4). This setting also discolors the screen somewhat while it's on, making it look similar to a picture that's overexposed; you'll see all of the details, but images and graphics won't look quite right. Small price to pay when you can actually use the phone in direct sunlight. S Pen experience What's a Note without an active stylus? The brand is synonymous with its S Pen in the same way peanut butter goes with jelly. It's arguably what helps the Note 4 stand out from its numerous competitors; very few companies have adopted the use of a stylus of any sort, let alone an active one that responds to changes in pressure, doubles as a desktop-like cursor and comes with an action button that offers additional features. To Samsung, it's not just about the extra real estate -- it's what you do with it that matters, and the S Pen gives the flagship a solid boost in productivity that's tough to duplicate anywhere else. Just like every other S Pen, the version included here is molded slightly differently than its counterparts, but it's about the same length and width as last year's pen and retains its elliptical shape. This model has ridges that provide a better grip for your hand, and the button is flush with the rest of the pen, making it just as difficult to press as ever. I often had to turn the pen around because it's almost impossible to tell which side is which when I'm not looking. It's easy to take out of its built-in holster on the bottom of the Note, thanks to a large gap at the base of the pen, where I can place my fingernail and simply pull down. The new pen is roughly twice as sensitive to pressure as the last one, capable of registering over 2,000 levels of sensitivity instead of 1,000. This, along with some haptic feedback on the screen and friction on the tip of the pen, is supposed to create a more realistic \"pen on paper\" feel; aside from the extra pressure sensitivity, however, the experience wasn't any closer to an actual pen or pencil than the Note 3 was. Pull out the pen and a radial Air Command menu pops up with four options. The first is Action Memo, which is like a Post-it note app that lets you write to-do lists, notes to self or anything else that's short and sweet -- and you can either save it to S Note (Samsung's primary notepad app) or pin it to your home screen as a resizable widget. Up next is Smart Select, which lets you clip a part of the screen and add it to a small gallery-style widget that floats above the top of all your running apps; neat concept, but I couldn't find much practical use for it. After that is Image Clip, which also gives you the ability to take snippets of whatever you want and store it for scrapbooking. Finally, there's Screen Write, which is carried over from the last Note; it takes a screenshot and then lets you doodle on it immediately afterward. The new S Pen is also capable of letting you select multiple lines of text by pressing down the action button and dragging the pen over the section you want to use. A menu pops up, giving you the option to copy the text, share it or even look up definitions in the dictionary. Copy and paste is an obvious use case, but I also found it handy when I accidentally took 20 burst photos and wanted a fast way to batch delete them; these are but two scenarios. This seems like one of those features that should've been there from the beginning, but oddly has been left out until now; regardless, it's a welcome addition that will make the process of sharing and selecting stuff faster and easier. You'll also still enjoy the ability to preview content by hovering the pen over pictures, videos, emails, calendar appointments and more; this has always been one of my favorite S Pen features since it debuted a couple years ago. However, Samsung's added actions to these preview screens, so you can now choose to share or edit that content directly from those thumbnails instead of having to back out and go through extra menus. With the added pressure sensitivity comes new capabilities. Samsung has included a calligraphy pen in the S Note collection, which is designed to let you draw fancy letters and numbers with a flourish. Since my wife has been learning the craft over the past year, I decided to have her put it to the test. Can this digital pen work as well as her traditional pen-and-ink setup? In short: No. She grew increasingly frustrated because it didn't properly mimic the behavior of the old-school ink and paper; doing the same brush strokes at the same angles and with the same amount of pressure produced entirely different results. Lines were light where they should've been heavy, and vice versa. She said that it works fine if you're just messing around, but no professional would want to use it on a regular basis -- and certainly not as a replacement to real-life calligraphy. Finally, another clever new S Pen feature is found in the S Note app. A photo icon in the toolbar takes you to a camera viewfinder. Take whatever picture you want and S Note can convert it to a digital (and editable) version of itself. If you see a sign with a phone number on it, you can take a picture of it, convert it through S Note and then copy it. One-handed use One of the most common complaints about large-screened phones is that they're nearly impossible to use one-handed. I can relate: Most devices this size are frustrating when you're trying to dig them out of your pocket and handle even the most mundane tasks when one of your hands isn't available. The final purchase decision often comes down to what you treasure most: Would you rather have ample screen space and battery life, or feel comfortable? The user's experience varies depending on hand size and personal preference -- it won't be a problem for those of you blessed with large digits -- but there are a few things phone makers can tweak on the hardware and firmware to give you a better one-handed experience without feeling like you're going to drop the device. Samsung's had several years to perfect the one-handed experience on the Note, and it shows in the Note 4. It is, by far, the best large-screened phone to use with one hand -- yes, better than the iPhone 6 Plus. I've already examined why this is the case from a hardware point of view, but Samsung's software features are more comprehensive and mature than Apple's nascent Reachability option. The Note 4 retains the same one-handed functionality from earlier models, which includes smaller dialpads and keyboards that align to the right or left side of the device, as well as a gesture that lets you swipe in and out from the edge and shrinks the entire screen to a more manageable size. These have always been handy, but not features I've used on a regular basis. With the latest Note, however, Samsung throws in some new gestures and panels that are more practical. First is a small menu that you can affix to either side of the screen. The menu, which stays hidden until you swipe inward from the edge, mimics the capacitive keys found on the bottom of the Note -- the home, back and recent apps buttons, in addition to a settings key. This allows you to easily navigate through the phone without trying to stretch your thumb or loosen your grip in order to reach those buttons. You can also adjust the opacity of this menu so it doesn't get in the way of anything displayed on the phone; and as soon as you're done using the menu, it'll get tucked back into the side, with only a thin tab indicating that something is even there. I found myself using this a lot more than I had originally expected. You can also shrink most native apps by dragging your finger from the top-left or top-right corner toward the center of the screen. This converts the program into a pop-up app, which can be resized, moved around the screen, placed on top of other pop-up apps, transferred into Multi Window or minimized to floating, circular icons that resemble Facebook's Chat Heads. If there's a limit to the number of windows you can have open at one time, I couldn't find it. My favorite use for this feature was the camera viewfinder, which I shrunk down and used during my tests while also checking my Gmail and Calendar at the same time. Multitasking! Software If you like what you've seen so far, here's another piece of good news: Samsung has trimmed down its in-your-face software experience. On the surface, it still looks like the freshly painted version of TouchWiz (with Android 4.4 KitKat running underneath) that first arrived on the Galaxy S5, but the company is continuing to clean up the UI and streamline its features; you're no longer going to find 500 pointless new options here. My Magazine, the Flipboard-esque eyesore that once occupied a full page on the home screen, is nowhere to be found on the Note 4. (In its place is Flipboard Briefing, which similarly displays social media and internet feeds, but this time you can actually disable it.) Several unnecessary smart features, like smart pause, smart rotation and smart scroll, are gone. Reading mode has also disappeared. Don't get the wrong idea: There are plenty of new features, some of which I've highlighted in earlier sections. But at least the additions that Samsung threw in this go-round are more useful, don't appear to slow down the phone and don't have me sprinting to the settings menu in an epic quest to get rid of them. Gallery | 67 Photos Samsung Galaxy Note 4 screenshots + See all 67 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Multi Window, one of my favorite Samsung features, is slightly improved. The camera viewfinder can now be opened into this mode, which is helpful if you're prone to falling into manholes or walking into street signs while texting. Also, when you go into the recent apps menu, certain apps come with a new dual-pane icon that opens the program directly into Multi Window mode. You can also transfer files from one window to another, and tapping on links in apps (Twitter, Facebook, Maps and so on) will open that link below in a second window, rather than closing one app and opening another. S Health now comes with more support. The Note 4 features sensors capable of detecting ultraviolet levels, blood oxygen saturation and heart rate (though when it comes to serious medical matters, I suggest sticking with dedicated external monitors rather than relying on Samsung), and you can connect plenty of wearables and other accessories to this hub as well. Camera There's more to the Note 4's camera than just a simple bump in resolution from 13MP to 16MP -- a lot more. The new shooter also comes with optical image stabilization, which is a first in any Samsung Galaxy smartphone (except the Zoom series). As I'll discuss shortly, this makes a difference in the performance of the camera. The rear camera isn't the only one that got a quality boost -- flip it around and you'll see a much better \"selfie camera\" as well. As painful as the term sounds, every phone maker is pushing hard to capitalize on the selfie trend. Samsung's in it to win it too, with a 3.7MP camera that offers a generous f/1.9 aperture (compared to f/2.45 on the Note 3 and f/2.4 on the GS5) for better low-light performance. Those vain glamour shots of yourself need to be taken just as often at night as during the day, right? It's still a little blurry -- in comparison, the 6 Plus' nighttime selfies are sharper, but much noisier -- but it's a vast improvement over the other Samsung flagships because you can actually see your face. One of the most intense areas of competition in the smartphone selfie sphere is how much you can actually fit in the shot -- the wide angle. On the Note 4, Samsung came up with a clever way to get more stuff in the field of view: a selfie panorama (selfierama?). In portrait, you can start in the center and then tilt to the left and right in whichever order you choose. The three images then stitch together to form one big picture taken at a 120-degree angle. It's not perfect, as it's pretty easy to see the stitching, but it's an interesting idea that simply needs to be improved upon. In case 3.7MP isn't enough for your face (really, who wants to zoom into their face even more than that?), set the camera to rear-selfie mode and the heart rate monitor acts as a shutter key that vibrates to let you know it's detected your face, and the intensity and frequency of those vibrations increases as the two-second timer counts down. Presto, now you can see every single precious pore. Turning focus to the 16MP camera on the back: It comes with an aperture of f/2.2, which is the same as the Galaxy S5 and perfectly average for smartphones in 2014. It comes with a handful of modes, like selective focus, panorama, dual camera and Shot & more, with a few more (animated, surround, sports, sequence and food) available for download. If manual settings are your thing, you can choose from ISO, white balance, HDR, exposure and metering modes. Gallery | 65 Photos Samsung Galaxy Note 4 sample shots + See all 65 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Daylight images taken on most Samsung flagships are quite good. They're generally in focus, have decent color saturation and are very well-detailed. That's not only true on the Note 4, but it also exceeds any expectations that I had: It focuses accurately and quickly, despite its lack of phase-detection autofocus; is closer to the actual colors than its predecessors; and comes with better white balance. HDR shots do a fantastic job of highlighting shadows without going overboard by looking too cartoonish. And the new Note got much more detailed digital zooms without sacrificing noise or light. But low-light performance is what impressed me the most about the Note 4. While ISOCELL helped improve the GS5 over the Note 3, it still wasn't very good. Optical image stabilization has made a tremendous difference here; objects that barely show up at all on other Samsung cameras can be easily seen on the Note 4. In fairness, the images still don't look as natural here as they do on the iPhone 6 Plus, but this is by far the best nighttime imaging performance I've seen on a Samsung phone. Even during the day, I managed to get crisp, in-focus shots when lightly shaking the device; scenic photos I took during a bumpy hayride came out as if no movement had even occurred. (For a look at some full-resolution Note 4 shots, head here.) Performance and battery life Raw power is not an area where any Note smartphone has struggled, and indeed, the latest model represents the series well. Armed with a brand-new Snapdragon 805 chipset, which packs four 2.7GHz Krait 450 cores and a 600MHz Adreno 420 GPU, as well as 3GB of RAM under the hood, the Note 4 is one of the most powerful devices on the market -- and will likely keep that status for months to come. Technically, the Note 4 comes in two flavors; the Snapdragon 805 featured in my review unit (an AT&T-branded device, by the way) and an Exynos 5433 chipset comprised of four 1.9GHz Cortex-A57 cores and four 1.3GHz Cortex-A53 cores. I have no way to determine which is the better of the two, but it's almost impossible to dislike the speed and performance at which the S805 operates. Certainly, it was more than sufficient for my needs. Excepting a small delay when pressing the recent apps button, I haven't been able to spot any lagging or slowing down from the device. And with the extensive amount of productivity and multitasking Samsung throws at the thing, I was truly impressed. Apps and games load quickly; frame skips and other bugs are few and far between; animations are smooth; and it handles multiple pop-up windows, Multi Window and other minimized apps with grace. This is a pleasant find for me, because latency and bugs have been commonplace in Samsung flagship phones for years. Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Samsung Galaxy S5 iPhone 6 Plus Quadrant 2.0 24,425 22,828 24,714 N/A Vellamo 3.0 1,808 1,994 1,656 N/A 3DMark IS Unlimited 20,692 18,933 17,954 17,902 SunSpider 1.0 (ms) 793 840 820 388 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 18.8 10.1 11.5 18.2 CF-Bench 43,234 38,020 33,351 N/A SunSpider: Lower scores are better. The Note 4 didn't win every benchmark test when compared to other signature Samsung devices and the iPhone 6 Plus -- it won about half of them -- but it still had a very strong showing in the ones it lost. In addition to the tests listed above, I also ran Geekbench and Basemark X; the Note 4 dominated the latter and kept up in the former. In a nutshell, the numbers essentially confirm something I already knew: This phone is fast and powerful. (Update: As a sidenote, the above benchmarks are part of a standard suite that we use on each and every review to remain consistent in our testing across the board. However, I also tested a few other cross-platform benchmarks that support both iOS and Android, to be more comprehensive in my comparisons between the Note 4 and 6 Plus. While the GFXBench offscreen scores came out in the Note's favor, the onscreen results curiously swing the other way: the 6 Plus's 18.1fps score bests the Note's 11.1. Additionally, the Note wins on Basemark X by a score of 18,222 to 16,538, while the iPhone defeats the Note on Geekbench 3 with a score of 2,803 over 2,746.) There's a 3,220mAh removable battery inside the Note 4, which is a very marginal improvement over the 3,200mAh cell inside the Note 3. Although the battery life was fantastic in last year's model, I came into the review concerned that a higher-resolution display and faster chipset would actually cause a decrease in the phone's longevity. Fortunately, it exceeded my expectations. After heavy use throughout the day, I typically went to bed with around 20 percent left over. This is assuring for power users who need a full day of battery life without compromises, but it's also nice to know that moderate to low use will provide even better results -- you should be able to stretch it and get around a day and a half to two days. In our endless video-loop test, the battery managed to keep going for just over 13 hours, a significant improvement over the Note 3. In a worst-case scenario: If you find yourself rapidly losing juice, the Note 4 added Ultra Power Saving Mode, which cuts off all but the most essential tasks. Finally, the fingerprint sensor seems to be much more reliable on the Note 4 than it was on the GS5. It takes fewer attempts to unlock the device, and I can even use it at angles without any fuss. That last part is critical when it comes to one-handed use, especially on a device as large as the Note; if I can't swipe my thumb across the home button at an angle, I have to use a second hand to steady the phone as I try swiping straight down from top to bottom. The competition The Note 4 will be available globally and the price varies by market, but the cheapest you can get in the US is $299 on-contract or $700 off-contract (each carrier offers it for different prices). Samsung's biggest competition is obvious: Apple's finally brought a large-screened smartphone of its own to market, the iPhone 6 Plus. It starts at $299 on-contract ($750 off) with 16GB internal storage and no external memory card slot, and you can add $100 to the cost to bump it up to 64GB or another $100 for 128GB. Much of the decision will come down to personal preference -- Android versus iOS, straight sides versus rounded, Multi Window versus Reachability. Aside from the 6 Plus, virtually every large-screened phone (or phablet, as the kids call them these days) is automatic competition for the Note 4, and there are a lot of options. LG, HTC, Huawei, ZTE, Oppo, Microsoft Devices, ASUS, Acer and (soon) Motorola all have handsets that are 5.5 inches or larger. The Note series has managed to stay unique thanks to its S Pen functionality, but that's only tempting if you actually care to use a stylus in the first place. Wrap-up The Galaxy Note 4 is the best large phone on the market. It's a device you'll be proud to whip out in public, thanks to its elegant design, robust build, beautiful screen, impressive battery life and solid camera. It also excels from a productivity standpoint, offering seamless multitasking and stylus functionality that's as smooth as I've ever seen on a smartphone. And despite its large size, Samsung has nailed the one-handed experience better than the competition. There's certainly a benefit to drawing from years of experience in this category: What began as an oddity three years ago has now evolved into a powerful tool at the top of its class. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android4.4, galaxynote, galaxynote4, google, mobilepostcross, note4, review, samsung, samsunggalaxynote4, spen, uk-feature, video \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20976807 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20976807\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android/4-4/\"> Google Android 4.4 </a> Google Android 4.4 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android/4-4/\" title=\"Google Android 4.4 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 28 </a> Prices Discussions Type Mobile / embedded OS Source model Open Released 2013-10-31 see all specs \u2192 8.9average user rating Ease of use 9.1 Speed 9.6 Configurability 9.2 Ecosystem (apps, drivers, etc.) 9.1 Openness 9.4 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 3 SIM Tool kit 3 How do you handle tracking your daily routines and journaling? 3 NEXUS PLAY Gaming Console Talk about the Google Android 4.4 with other people who own it too! start a discussion see all discussions \u2192 <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/note/3/\"> Samsung Galaxy Note 3 </a> Samsung Galaxy Note 3 AT&T Sprint T-Mobile Verizon 32GB Unlocked 64GB Unlocked Buy from $19 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/note/3/\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy Note 3 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 68 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android (Jelly Bean [4.3]) Screen size 5.7 inches Internal memory 32 GB Carriers (US) AT&T Dimensions 6 x 3.1 x 0.33 in Weight 5.9 oz Released 2013-10-01 see all specs \u2192 9.2average user rating Reception and call quality 9 Display 9.9 Battery life 8.9 Camera 8.7 Ease of use 8.8 Design and form factor 8.8 Portability (size / weight) 8.5 Media support 9.7 Durability 8.4 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 8.9 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 Displaying prices for model: AT&T-White AT&T-Black Sprint-White Verizon-Black Verizon-White $19.99 + tax & shipping Buy now $199.99 on contract Buy now 10 88 this one and Iphone 5s 97 Really? 9 Portability of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 0 Audio quality Tests & Comparisons - II !

Consumers once leaned toward the former, but many have lately changed their minds. The so-called phablet has come a long way since Samsung came out with the first Galaxy Note in 2011, and now it's not uncommon to see several of them as you walk down the street. Nearly every manufacturer has at least one or two such devices in their lineup, so it's about time Google stepped in with some outsized hardware of its own. The company just launched the Nexus 6, a 6-inch phone made in collaboration Motorola that comes with a winning feature list and is just as glorious as the Moto X it shares a likeness with. Aside from being a strong handset in its own right, it's meant to be a blueprint to inspire Google's partners as they work on their own devices. It's not as affordable as Nexus phones from the past two years, but at $649 it's still less than most premium-grade flagships of similar size. With that in mind, let's find out if the Nexus 6 serves as an encouragement... or a disappointment.

It's powerful, high-res and comes with the latest and greatest version of Android. But be warned that it's difficult to use with one hand, and its battery life is average at best.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-65136{display:none;} .cke_show_borders #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-65136, #postcontentcontainer #fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-65136{width:570px;display:block;} try{document.getElementById(\"fivemin-widget-blogsmith-image-65136\").style.display=\"none\";}catch(e){} The Nexus 6 is not only named for its nearly 6-inch screen size, but also its order in the series. It joins a prestigious lineup of devices Google has crafted as examples to its Android partners, each one acting as a physical manifestation of the company's mobile vision for the coming year. It only takes a quick look at the Nexus 6 to figure out what Google's focusing on this time around: phablets and premium quality. It's a jarring contrast to last year's Nexus 5, which fit the mold for an affordable, yet high-end phone; at $349, it was the best smartphone you could buy (it's still among the best, a full year later), whereas the Nexus 6, which starts at $649, comes with an even better spec sheet and looks much fancier and... well, more expensive. Both are good options, but you aren't going to be buying the new Nexus on a whim. Google's new phone doesn't look anything like its predecessors, but it has a rather uncanny resemblance to the Moto X. In fact, it looks almost exactly like a blown-up version of Motorola's flagship, with only a few exceptions. That's a good move on Google's part, because the X is beautifully designed and well-built. It didn't become a doppelg\u00e4nger by accident -- the N6 was built in collaboration with Motorola, and was announced just six weeks after the X debuted. It's fashioned with the same metal frame and curved (fingerprint-friendly) polycarbonate back, albeit without the vast array of customizable color options; no bamboo or wood, just dark blue and white for now. Another key difference between the X and the N6 is the dimple on the back. The former features a metallic ring that distractingly screams for your attention, while the latter uses a soft depression that's indented in the plastic back itself (like the original Moto X) in a way that doesn't interrupt the design. It could be argued that this point is rendered moot by the mammoth Nexus logo underneath, as well as Motorola's signature \"M,\" but at least the dimple looks better. The front of the phone comes with stereo speakers, another improvement over the X; they remind me of HTC's BoomSound, and are just as loud as the audio on the One M8. Smart move, since large phones should come with stellar media experiences; if you have a big, Quad HD display, you don't want to ruin a good movie by having horrible audio. At 10.1mm thick, the Nexus 6 is thicker than the average phone, but it doesn't look or feel like it. That's because it's a curvaceous phone that starts out thick in the middle and tapers down to incredibly thin edges.Whereas the iPhone 6 Plus and Nokia Lumia 1520 have thin, rounded (and thus sharp) edges, the Nexus 6 comes with flat sides, providing a comfortable fit and feel because they aren't digging into my fingers every time I grab onto the device. A big phone like the Nexus is also going to be heavier than most: The N6 is 6.49 ounces (184g), more than the 6.07-ounce iPhone 6 Plus or Samsung's 6.21-ounce Galaxy Note 4. Yet for some reason -- perhaps the way that weight is distributed -- I've never given this stat a second thought. It's no lightweight, but the extra grams won't be a discouraging factor for most. I'm not going to knock Google for creating a large-screened phone, because there's a huge market for it. For every person that gives me a weird look for using one, there's another who pines for a larger screen to view more text, watch videos on Netflix and to look at pictures. Personally, I like big phones as long as I can use them efficiently in one-handed scenarios (I find myself in those situations a lot). And unfortunately, this is an area where the Nexus 6 suffers. Each time I used it with one hand it turned into an exercise in maintaining balance. The plastic is slick and I simply can't reach my thumb everywhere it needs to go without contorting my hands. If you buy the phone, go in with the expectation that you'll handle it with both paws most of the time. The screen isn't just big -- it's as high-definition as you can get these days, thanks to the Quad HD AMOLED panel. That's 2,560 x 1,440 pixels spread over the 5.96-inch display, which comes out to a pixel density of 493 ppi. It's technically not as dense as the Galaxy Note 4, which uses the same number of pixels on a smaller screen, but you'll be hard-pressed to notice a difference in quality between the two. As with the Note 4, it's a beautiful sight, but the improvement over 1080p isn't as significant as it would be on, say, a TV. As long as the higher resolution doesn't impair the battery life, I have no problem with that spec; if it involves a trade-off of power efficiency, however, it's not worth it. The display itself is a little on the saturated side, though not as heavy on the extra color as the Note 4. Then again, Samsung might go more overboard with the saturation, but it at least includes various display modes allowing you to adjust the color. Moving on, darks are just as dark, though the whites seem to have a warmer temperature and aren't as bright (though it's at least much better than the Nexus 5's LCD panel, which bleeds light like crazy). Viewing angles are good, and I can see it reasonably well in direct sunlight. It also comes with an ambient display mode, which is a similar concept to what you'll find on the Moto X. When you pick up the device off of a flat surface or whenever a new notification arrives, the display shows your notifications in a very dim white glow. This is a nice feature that lets you see what just showed up without having to activate the entire lockscreen each time the phone buzzes or beeps, which hopefully helps conserve battery life and makes it less distracting and more convenient for the user. Update: One area of the display I initially overlooked (thanks to Ron Amadeo at Ars Technica for finding it!) is its auto-brightness setting. When turned on and set to the lowest possible brightness, the display changes to a pinkish glow. By doing so, it effectively makes the screen one of the dimmest I've ever seen; this actually comes in incredibly handy when I'm trying to read something in a pitch dark room -- such as when I'm in bed. And obviously, if you don't care for the pink hue or need it a little brighter, you can easily adjust the settings. Android 5.0 You'll forgive me for leaving this section a tad shorter than normal. Continuing its history of releasing new firmware in tandem with new hardware, Google has introduced Android 5.0 Lollipop, building it into the Nexus 6 and the Nexus 9 tablet. Since we already spent some time with the Nexus 9, I was able to take a close look at the OS in my preview, so wander over there to get the full lowdown on what's new. In a nutshell, though, Lollipop comes with a fresh new look known as Material Design, which attempts to apply physical rules to a digital interface. It's clean, minimal and alive, thanks to a litany of animations that react to your touch. It seeks to eliminate as many distractions as possible so you can concentrate on the task at hand. Google accomplishes this in a couple ways: through actionable notifications that drop down from the top of the screen, and a do not disturb mode with imposable time limits and white lists. Lollipop also brings performance and battery life enhancements, as well as a Smart Lock feature that lets you bypass the lock screen as long as your Bluetooth device is nearby. It's definitely one of the biggest updates Android has ever seen. And I like it: It's fun to use and easy on the eyes. But despite Lollipop's fancy new design and useful features, its presence on the Nexus 6 highlights one of the update's few weaknesses: the one-handed experience. Unless your hands are much larger than mine (I believe I'm in the average category), the new Nexus is nigh impossible to operate without the assistance of a second set of phalanges; the curved back helps somewhat, but the slippery polycarbonate doesn't. You could argue that this is a problem with most large phones, and that it's just one of the compromises you'll have to make in exchange for a tablet-like experience. But several manufacturers have found ways to enhance one-handed use; the 5.7-inch Note 4, for instance, comes with extra menus that make the phone easier to operate when you only have one hand free. Stock Android on the Nexus 6 lacks these kinds of handy features. This is definitely something you'll need to overlook if you're interested in getting the latest and greatest Nexus. Lollipop also doesn't do much to take advantage of the additional space. Having a larger screen makes it so you can read more text at a time from a book or Chrome page, but the new update lacks features like split-screen mode and floating apps, which can be incredibly useful when you're trying to multitask. Additionally, none of Android's native apps come with extra panes when you turn the phone onto its side and use it in landscape mode. You can't even convert the home screen into landscape, which can be slightly annoying if you're trying to move from one app to another (at least Overview works this way, but that's only helpful if you're switching to an app or Chrome tab that you've recently used). Just like on the original Moto X, the Nexus 6 (and any Lollipop-supported device with the right hardware) comes with voice activation, allowing you to use \"OK Google\" as the voice trigger. However, you don't get the chance to make up your own phrase, as you can on the Moto X; it's unfortunate that Motorola didn't work with Google to incorporate the feature this time around. In general, too, the voice activation still needs a little more work on the N6 -- it didn't always hear my voice. Strangely, the double-tap-to-wake feature, which was shown off in early hands-on demos and prominently featured on the Nexus 9, is now nowhere to be seen. I've asked Google for comment, and a company rep simply responded that the feature is not included on the device right now. It seems odd that it got left out of the final product, as it would've made it a little easier to handle the phone with one hand. Camera The Nexus lineup is designed to express Google's hardware vision for Android manufacturers. Historically, however, we'd have to take its imaging \"vision\" with a grain of salt: The past few Nexus' cameras have been mediocre at best. Combine this tradition with the subpar shooters on Motorola's latest phones, and you'll understand why I didn't have high expectations for the Nexus 6's camera going into this review. Its 13-megapixel rear module means you'll at least get a higher resolution than the 8MP Nexus 5, and it also comes with optical image stabilization, a pleasant addition. It should also be better than its predecessor at taking low-light shots thanks to its f/2.0 aperture (a bump up from f/2.4 on the N5). If you've used the latest stock Android camera app, you'll feel at home on the N6. You can pull up a camera mode menu by swiping out from the left edge; this lets you choose among camera, video, panorama, lens blur and Photo Sphere (yep, it's still supported). Like Motorola's other phones, it's missing some manual options; you can change resolution and exposure, but not white balance, ISO, shutter speed or anything else. You can do a ton of tweaks after the fact, though it's best not to rely on that every time you take a cruddy shot. Also, you can still access the camera directly from the lock screen, as you've been able to do in previous versions of Android, with one difference: You have to swipe directly left from the camera icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen in order to activate it. (Same goes for the phone dialer, which requires swiping directly right.) Gallery | 85 Photos Nexus 6 sample shots + See all 85 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Nexus 6 did at taking daylight shots. Google did a better job with the imaging experience overall, compared to the Nexus 5. Most of my images were well detailed and crisp. What it lacks in manual controls it makes up for in the default experience -- much like the iPhone experience, you can take a shot without worrying about how it's going to turn out. HDR mode is subtle yet effective, white balance is good and colors are a tad saturated in some situations but are kept within reason. I'd see blown-out highlights on occasion as well, but never was it so blatant that it completely ruined the photo. A camera with such a large aperture should bode well for nighttime shots, but unless you use the dual-LED flash to brighten up your subjects, you're not going to see much of anything. This comes as a bit of a surprise, especially since even the Nexus 5 did a better job of picking up light in dark settings (albeit with a lot of noise). If you're going to be taking a lot of pictures at night, this isn't going to work out for you. The camera also typically chooses a slower shutter time when light becomes scarce, so fast-moving kids and other objects can turn into the Blur. Taking pictures using HDR mode requires a bit of patience; it takes a few seconds to switch into HDR from regular mode, and once you fire off a shot, it takes an unusually long time to process. This can be frustrating when compared to many other devices capable of processing HDR in real-time, so you can even see what the photo will look like before you've even taken it. Not so here. (High-res samples will be available here shortly.) Performance and battery life The new Nexus comes with the best chipset you can get on any Android device right now: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 805. This is the same SoC found on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Note Edge and Motorola Droid Turbo (Moto Maxx), and comes with four 2.65GHz Krait 450 cores and a top-of-the-line Adreno 420 graphics processor. If you want the power without having to futz around with TouchWiz or availability restrictions, the Nexus 6 is going to take very good care of you. The N6 is among the most capable smartphones on the market, at least from a real-use perspective. (Some benchmarks don't agree, as you'll see below, but it's a mixed bag.) Sure, it doesn't come with 64-bit support, but this wasn't a problem for me; everything from the mundane tasks to the graphic-intensive games like NOVA 3, Modern Combat 5 and Asphalt 8 ran as smoothly as possible on a smartphone -- and for a phone that has such a large screen pushing a Quad HD resolution, that's never a sure thing. With the Nexus 6, that combination of power and display makes the gaming experience even better than it normally is on a flagship smartphone. Nexus 6 Moto X (2014) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Geekbench 3 3,286 2,986 2,746 Vellamo 3.0 Multicore 1,479 2,093 1,808 3DMark IS Unlimited 23,233 19,568 20,692 SunSpider 1.0 (ms) 782 787 793 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan (fps) 18.7 off/11.9 on 11.9 off/12.8 on 18.8 off/11.1 on CF-Bench 34,968 39,018 43,324 SunSpider: lower scores are better Of course, that combo may be great for gaming, but it's normally a death sentence for your beloved battery life. The N6's 3,220mAh cell is identical in size to the Note 4, but the Nexus is burdened with far greater expectations; it comes with stock Android (read: no TouchWiz) and makes use of Project Volta, Google's new effort to make Android more power efficient. But Project Volta needs some work. The Nexus 6 doesn't have terrible battery life, but it's definitely not as good as many similarly sized phones. I used the device extensively at Engadget Expand last weekend, and I was lucky if the phone got more than 13 or 14 hours. A battery of that size and supposed power efficiency should still have juice left over after a full day of heavy use, and the 6 just wasn't up to the task. Most days, I could only get around four hours of screen-on time. As you'd expect, moderate to light usage will get you through two days, but it's much more likely that you'll be taking advantage of the large screen for both normal smartphone use and tablet-like consumption as well, and it needs to get through a full day at minimum with that kind of use. Fortunately the Nexus 6 comes with Qualcomm's Quick Charging and Qi wireless charging, so you have more options to add more juice to your battery life faster and in more places. The competition While the Nexus 5 was in a class all its own last fall, the same can't be said about the 6 -- not in price or size. The 32GB model costs $649 unlocked and 64GB is an extra $50 (both of which are a better deal storage-wise than the iPhones 6). That puts it in direct competition with most flagship devices currently on the market. To be fair, most big-screened devices -- anything larger than 5.5-inches -- sell for even more, which means the N6 is one of the best deals you'll find for a top-of-the-line smartphone of that size and quality. The Note 4, which is slightly smaller, but comes with 32GB internal storage, microSD support, a removable battery and an S Pen, is unlocked on Amazon for around $820. Additionally, the iPhone 6 Plus starts at $749 for 16GB ($849 for 64GB and $949 for 128GB). Those may be the most popular options, but there are less expensive large-screened devices: The Huawei Ascend Mate 2 is $300 and has a 6.1-inch 720p display, Snapdragon 400 chipset and much larger 4,050mAh battery. There's also the 5.5-inch LG G3, which has a Quad HD display, Snapdragon 801 and slightly smaller battery than the N6; it's now going for around $500 unlocked online. It's a tough market for big phones right now, and Google's new Nexus fits right in the middle of them all. For what it's worth, if you need something larger than the Note 4, the N6 is your best premium option. (Update: The Nexus 6 will be available on Google Play, Motorola's website and through US carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon, though carrier pricing differs slightly from Google's and Motorola's. Keep in mind that some carrier versions may come locked, so if you want to ensure that your model is unlocked, go through Google or Motorola instead. Inventory will likely be pretty limited at first, though, so you'll want to keep a close eye on those channels.) Wrap-up In general, Google's first shot at a large-screened device (not to mention its first Nexus collaboration with Motorola) is a good one. The Nexus 6 comes with features that the Moto X should have had in the first place, including a powerful next-gen Snapdragon processor, improved camera, new version of Android and a premium design. Watching movies on the N6 is a treat, with loud, front-facing stereo speakers and a Quad HD display. And while the $649 price may seem high, it's actually lower than the Note 4, iPhone 6 Plus and other large phones with top-notch specs. What it lacks is a little more telling. Its mediocre battery life indicates that Google's Project Volta could use some TLC. Additionally, if you're buying the phone because it has a big screen and you want to use it as a phone/tablet hybrid, you're not only trading off a comfortable one-handed experience, but you're also doing so without features that take advantage of the extra real estate, like Multi Window or dual-pane mode for when the phone is in landscape. These may be small misses that likely won't affect your purchase decision, but they suggest Google still has room for improvement when it comes to making a large-screened smartphone.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/21/hp-slatebook-14-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "August 21st 2014 at 3:00 pm", "body": " There's mounting evidence that HP, once the leading PC maker, does not know what it's doing. After announcing plans to cut up to 5 percent of its work force, the company is basically throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks. Recent experiments include a luxury smartwatch, Chromebooks, a $199 Window notebook and now, a laptop running Android. Here's the sales pitch, and bear with me if this doesn't make sense: The SlateBook 14, according to HP, is for students and teens who already use Android on their mobile devices. In other words, they already own a Galaxy S5 or what have you, and they should have an Android laptop to match. The idea is that they might choose this over a Chromebook because it has more apps, and because it's more familiar. Ditto for Windows laptops -- except, you know, Windows actually has lots of apps too. Setting aside HP's flawed logic (they never said Windows users should stick to Windows Phone): Why would you pay $430 for a laptop running an OS that was primarily meant to be used with the fingers? Gallery | 28 Photos HP SlateBook 14 review + See all 28 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 60 HP SlateBook 14 Pros Good battery life Sharp display Comfortable keyboard, generally good build quality Cons Android is awkward to use with a mouse Polarizing design Heavy compared to an Android tablet with a keyboard dock A poor value versus Chromebooks or Windows laptops Summary Even with a crisp display and comfortable keyboard, the SlateBook 14 doesn't have enough to recommend it. With an operating system that was never meant to be used on a laptop, it's a poor choice compared to less-expensive Windows laptops and Chromebooks. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Take what I say here with a grain of salt: The same way Vogue editor Anna Wintour is allowed to like a dress covered in futuristic space-snails, I'm allowed to like a laptop decked out in Lamborghini yellow. Personally, I kinda dig how the black lid and keyboard deck contrast with the bright hinge and sides. The only place where HP goes too far is the bottom side of the machine. It's all yellow -- right in your face. Ditto for the prominent Beats Audio logo, located on the right side of the hinge, right in your line of sight whenever you're looking at the screen. In any case, whether you love or hate the yellow accents, I think we can agree on this: It's insane that in addition to releasing an Android laptop in the first place -- a niche product if ever there was one -- HP chose the most polarizing design possible, and didn't even offer any color options. Want that yellow to be cyan instead? Tough noogies, kiddos. You can have a yellow laptop running Android or... something else entirely. It's a shame, because this is otherwise a fairly well-made laptop, especially for $430. The lid is made of aluminum, and while the rest is constructed from plastic, those bits still feel solid; the thing never bends when you grab it by the palm rest. The 1080p touchscreen is sharper than almost everything else I've seen in this price range, and while the LED-backlit panel doesn't provide the best viewing angles, the quality is still a big step up over every Chromebook I've tested. The keyboard is sturdy too, with well-spaced buttons that provide a decent amount of travel. And of course, Beats Audio offers better sound than what you'll get on other budget notebooks. Still, I can see where someone might overlook all of that if they couldn't get past the screaming yellow. At 3.71 pounds, the laptop is on the heavy side. Not for a 14-inch laptop, mind you, but it's still much weightier than a smaller Android tablet with a detachable case or keyboard dock. It's also heavier than most Chromebooks, as well as some budget Windows laptops (I'm talking about the netbook-sized 11-inch models here). Considering Android isn't that useful on a laptop, I have to question whether owning a relatively heavy notebook is worth it when you could just buy a tablet or Chromebook and call it a day. It's also not like you get that many more ports on a machine this big. As on some Chromebooks, there's a full-sized HDMI socket, a headphone jack and a memory card reader to help offset the rather paltry 16GB of built-in storage. Incidentally, that slot actually takes microSD, not SD, cards -- a normal spec for phones and tablets, but an oddity on a 14-inch laptop. All told, the main difference in I/O between this and a Chromebook is that you get three USB ports here instead of two, but I'd hardly call that a selling point. Performance and battery life Excuse me while I point out the obvious: Android was not designed to be used with a mouse. Personally, I use the Moto X as my daily driver. I spend more hours a day staring at KitKat than I'd like to admit. And yet, when I opened the SlateBook for the first time, I paused for a moment, unsure of what to do next. After a couple seconds, of course, I came to my senses and did what any reasonable person would do: I reached up and touched the screen. And so it went. Several days into using the SlateBook, and I've rarely touched the trackpad. It happens to be a very nice trackpad, and it comes in handy when I'm reading a website and would rather not reach across the keyboard to scroll down the page. Otherwise, though, I use my fingers, just as I would on my phone. HP SlateBook 14 NVIDIA Shield Tablet Tegra Note 7 Samsung Galaxy Tab S Quadrant 2.0 16,482 20,556 16,066 18,597 Vellamo 2,458 3,055 3,314 1,672 3DMark IS Unlimited 16,040 30,970 16,473 12,431 SunSpider 1.0 (ms) 685 463 586 1,109 CF-Bench 34,655 43,033 34,386 31,695 SunSpider: Lower scores are better. The same way there's only one color option for the SlateBook, there's just one spec configuration. That would be the $430 model I tested here, which has 2GB of RAM, 16GB of built-in storage and an NVIDIA Tegra 4 chip -- the same one used in the Note 7 tablet. But in a way, the performance is moot. I mean, of course you want the device to run smoothly. And it does. Apps launch quickly. The OS is quick to respond if I want to see a list of my open programs; closing and switching applications is a breeze. Web pages load quickly, albeit not as fast as most Chromebooks. The thing is, the SlateBook's quad-core Tegra 4 processor can handle even more than that. You know, like games. But on a device like this, why would you even bother? Who wants to cradle a 14-inch, 3.7-pound laptop, all so that they can tilt their way through Need For Speed? Who wants to reach across the keyboard when you could rest a tablet in your lap? And if you're content to only play browser games, why don't you use your $430 to buy a proper laptop? The more I use the SlateBook, the more I think Android users would be better served by a tablet that can pair with either a keyboard case or detachable keyboard dock; you'd get more portability, similar battery life (more on that in a minute) and greater versatility when it comes to gaming. And yet you'd still have that keyboard when you needed it. If you're the sort of person who does a ton of typing -- email, web surfing, office docs -- you'd be better off with either a Chromebook or a Windows machine. At least those operating systems were meant to be used with a mouse. Battery life HP SlateBook 14 9:03 ASUS C200 11:19 ASUS Transformer Book T100 10:40 Dell Chromebook 11 8:37 ASUS Transformer Pad TF103C 8:26 NVIDIA Shield Tablet 8:23 Samsung Chromebook 2 (13-inch) 8:22 Toshiba Chromebook 8:15 Acer C720 Chromebook (Intel Core i3) 7:53 Acer C720 Chromebook (Intel Celeron) 7:49 HP Chromebook 11 5:08 Chromebook Pixel 4:08 (WiFi)/3:34 (LTE) The SlateBook 14's 32Wh battery is rated for nine hours of runtime and indeed, I got exactly nine hours and three minutes of continuous video playback (that's with WiFi on, fixed brightness and Facebook and Twitter set to poll periodically). On the one hand, that's great for a laptop; it's the sort of longevity you'd expect from a $1,000 Ultrabook, but not necessarily a bargain-basement notebook, especially not one like this with a bigger screen. On the other hand, nine-hour battery life is only marginally better than what most Chromebooks are capable of, and again, those tend to be more portable than the machine we have here. It's also on par with Android tablets, like the new NVIDIA Shield tablet or the ASUS Transformer Pad TF103C, which costs $299 with a keyboard dock. Even if you wanted a Windows system, you could find a low-powered laptop or hybrid that delivers long battery life. (There are plenty of options in the 11-inch range.) Have I made my point clearly enough? Long battery life is not a good enough reason to buy this. Software Not that it matters -- I'm recommending you don't buy this -- but the SlateBook runs Jelly Bean (version 4.3), with an upgrade to KitKat expected to arrive sometime in Q4. Thankfully, HP left Android as is; there are no skins here, no home screen panels that are impossible to remove. Nope, this is Android as Google meant it to be experienced. Really, the only mark HP left on the device is a handful of pre-installed apps. These include ones for Box.com, Evernote, Skitch, Skype, Hulu Plus, Splashtop, NVIDIA TegraZone, Kingsoft Office and CyberLink PowerDirector Mobile. You'll also find some apps from HP itself, including Connected Drive, Connected Music, Connected Photo, ePrint, Media Player and File Manager. There's also a \"Games\" app, which is really just a store for WildTangent titles. In any case, if none of this strikes your fancy, you can always uninstall them in the settings and free up a little bit of space. Wrap-up The SlateBook is an interesting specimen. That's why I wanted to review it: because I was curious about the idea of an Android laptop, and thought you might be too. And it is interesting. But by no means should you actually buy one. The SlateBook takes Android, an otherwise intuitive operating system, and manages to make it... cumbersome. It's a pain to use with a mouse, and yet if you want to use your fingers, you have to reach across the keyboard. Because that keyboard doesn't detach, the device is far heavier than a standalone tablet, and the battery life isn't even that much better. If you love the Android experience, just buy a tablet with a keyboard case. If the typing experience is paramount, there are Windows laptops that are less expensive and more portable. Even a Chromebook would make more sense than the SlateBook; at least Chrome OS was designed to be used with a mouse. Samsung's 13-inch Chromebook 2, for instance, has just as sharp a display and costs $30 less, and there are loads of options that are even cheaper. Frankly, I'm not sure I'd recommend an Android laptop at any price, but for $430 the answer's easy: Just don't do it. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: android, Android 4.3, android jelly bean, AndroidJellyBean, hp, HP slatebook, hp slatebook 14, hpslatebook, hpslatebook14, jelly bean, jellybean, mobilepostcross, review, slatebook, slatebook 14, slatebook14, tegra 4, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20946514 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20946514\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android/4-1/\"> Google Android 4.1 </a> Google Android 4.1 4.2 4.3 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/google/android/4-1/\" title=\"Google Android 4.1 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 74 </a> Prices Discussions Type Mobile / embedded OS Source model Open Released 2013-07-24 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Ease of use 9 Speed 9 Configurability 9.2 Ecosystem (apps, drivers, etc.) 8.9 Openness 9.4 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 23 First impressions of Jelly Bean on the HTC One X 1 Pixel QI Hybrid Screens 8 Well defined desires for a device, confusing reviews, please HELP ME!

In an unusual twist, Apple not only gave us a sneak peek of the software, but also allowed a large section of the public to take it for a spin while it was still in development. Though the company has declined to say how many people signed up for the beta program (there were a million available spots), we're sure many of you are running it right now, and don't even need to read a full review. That said, I wanted to finish what I started. Back when I posted my initial preview, I was able to discuss lots of things -- the iOS-inspired design, the new Safari browser -- but certain stuff wasn't ready for prime time. I'm talking about iCloud Drive, Apple's new cross-platform storage service, as well as \"Continuity,\" a set of features that allow Macs to better integrate with iOS. Think: the ability to receive calls on your Mac, or to start reading an article on your iPad and finish it on your laptop. Now that the software is final -- and now that I've had a chance to test all the features -- I'm ready to weigh in. Suffice to say, it's clear that to make the most out of Yosemite, you need an iDevice to go with it. But even for Mac users who don't also own an iPhone (guilty!), this is still a solid upgrade. Read on to see what I mean. Gallery | 71 Photos OS X Yosemite review + See all 71 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 86 Apple OS X Yosemite Pros Tight integration with iOS devices Clean new design Much-improved Spotlight search Safari has a cleaner design, useful privacy features Cons iCloud Drive doesn't include a standalone iOS app Can't add new people to a texting conversation unless you start with at least three people Yosemite is a modest upgrade for people who don't own an iOS device Summary OS X Yosemite is a solid update for Mac users, but in order to make the most out of it, you need to also own an iOS device.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Look and feel Regardless of whether you're also an iOS user, you're going to be treated to a noticeably different design. From the dock to the \"minimize\" button within apps, everything in OS X has a flatter, more modern aesthetic. All of Apple's built-in apps have new dock icons, devoid of any 3D shading or skeuomorphic details. The menu bar now sits flush against the rest of the desktop -- not that it was ever in the way. Inside apps, there's a narrower toolbar up top, with buttons either hidden or arranged in a single row. Make no mistake: There's a big emphasis on tidiness here, not to mention space savings. Additionally, Apple moved to a new font and new icons -- some of them lifted straight from iOS (take the \"share\" button in Finder, for example). Speaking of Finder, the \"stoplights,\" those red, yellow and green buttons in the upper-left corner, are now flat as well; no 3D effects here. More importantly, that green button now lets you bring apps to full screen -- a change many of you will appreciate. Finally, Apple went all-in with translucent panels. You could already see that in last year's \"Mavericks\" release, what with its see-through menu bar, but with Yosemite, Apple went a step further. Here, the toolbar inside apps is also translucent, so that the color changes depending on your wallpaper or which windows are open in the background. Even the box you see when you adjust the volume has a subtle translucent effect. In any case, I hope you like see-through detailing, because Apple clearly does. Personally, I like the design, but I understand there are some who think the old version was just fine, and didn't need fixing. For what it's worth, I don't really think about it anymore. That's largely because the OS X user experience is fundamentally unchanged; I get around the operating system the same way I always did. So, once I tired of my little game -- looking for design-related Easter eggs (hello, new battery-charging icon!) -- it was business as usual. In fact, now that I've been using Yosemite awhile, I barely even notice the new look. And that's a good thing. Continuity I'll talk about Continuity next, since it's one of the most important features of Yosemite, and also one of the few things I didn't get to address in my initial preview. Before I dive in, though, I need to rain on a few people's parades: Although Yosemite itself can run on machines dating back several years (2007, in some cases), the Continuity feature in particular will only work with newer devices. Specifically, you'll need a MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac or Mac mini from 2012 or later. If you have a Mac Pro, it has to be from at least late 2013. If you plan on using AirDrop to share files between your Mac and an iOS device, that iOS device must have a Lightning connector and run iOS 7 or higher. Finally, of course, you'll need to make sure all your devices are signed in with the Apple ID. Phone calls and text messages Got it? Good. Now, on to the fun stuff. Of all the new Continuity features, the ability to send and receive calls and texts from your Mac is perhaps the flashiest. In either case, you'll need an iPhone running iOS 8 (make that 8.1 for texting). With voice calls, you can get started pretty quickly (just sign into FaceTime on both devices), but for texting, you'll have to go through a one-time setup process. This involves having a six-digit verification code sent to your Mac, which you then enter on your phone. Pretty straightforward. Once you're set up, initiating a phone call is as easy as clicking on a phone number anywhere in the OS (Maps, contact cards, et cetera). Incoming calls will appear as a notification in the upper-right corner, with options to mute or switch to a video call once you pick up. Also, even if your phone is right next to your computer, both will ring; you'll always have the option of picking up in either place. It's a similar deal with texts: Incoming messages live in the built-in Messages app on both your computer and your iOS device. To send a text, you can use Messages, obviously, or you can click on a phone number in Contacts, Calendar or Safari (it's not like with initiating a phone call, where you can click a phone number anywhere in the OS). Finally, you can send and receive SMS/MMS messages regardless of what device your friends are using. Instant Hotspot Also included in Yosemite (and iOS 8.1) is the ability to automatically use your iPhone as a hotspot for your Mac. So long as you're signed in with the same Apple ID, and connected over Bluetooth, Instant Hotspot will make your phone appear in your WiFi network list as just another connection. From there, in that same list, you can see your phone's LTE signal, as well as your remaining battery life. \"OK,\" you're saying, \"but I could have used my iPhone as a hotspot anyway.\" This is very true. But, there are a couple advantages to doing it this way. For one, Instant Hotspot allows your phone to automatically disconnect when not in use. Also, once your Mac detects that it's connected to the internet via your iPhone, it will delay certain data-intensive tasks, like software updates and Time Machine backups, until you're back on WiFi. Handoff Handoff is a feature I mentioned earlier, the one that lets you start doing something on one device, and pick it up on another. Maybe you started reading an Engadget story on your iPhone on your commute into work, and want to finish it at the office. Or maybe you looked up something in Maps before leaving for a meeting, and want to take it with you. You get the idea. In any case, if you're picking up on your Mac, you'll see a pop-up notification in the dock, near whatever app it is you're using. So, when I opened up Engadget on an iPhone, for instance, I saw the above notification near the Safari icon on my desktop. It's all pretty self-explanatory, but keep in mind that if you're using multiple iOS devices (say, an iPhone and an iPad), your Mac will only show you one Handoff notification at a time, and it will always be the more recent of the two. Finally, obvious as it might be, Handoff only works if both devices are turned on. Also, Handoff was originally designed to work with Apple's own apps, including Mail, Safari, Maps, Messages, Reminders, Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Keynote, Numbers and Pages. Thankfully, though, Apple has released an API to developers, which means we'll probably soon see this feature baked into lots of third-party apps like Chrome, Gmail and Mailbox. Handoff is neat, but I hope no one ever feels compelled to abandon their favorite apps for it. AirDrop AirDrop is a feature that debuted three years ago back on OS X Lion, allowing Macs to share files over a peer-to-peer connection, no WiFi required. With Yosemite, though, Apple is extending that feature to include not just Macs, but, you guessed it, iOS devices as well. In addition, your friends can now send you things from AirDrop even when you don't have Finder open, which is also something you couldn't do before. If you happen to be sending something to yourself (read: to a different device with the same Apple ID), the file will just download automatically. If you really are sharing with a friend, though, you'll see a notification on your Mac, asking if you choose to accept the download. You'll also see whom the download's from, along with a preview of the file -- say, an image thumbnail. iCloud Drive You've heard of Google Drive. And Microsoft OneDrive. Now Apple is introducing iCloud Drive and yes, it's exactly what it sounds like: an online repository for your files, with the option to access them on a variety of different devices. That includes Macs, iPhones, iPads and iPod touches, of course, though Apple also released a Windows desktop client as well. It's such a no-brainer idea, in fact, that I still can't believe Apple didn't already offer a service like this. In fact, though, prior to Yosemite, storing things in iCloud just meant backing up your stuff there; it didn't mean you had a way of retrieving individual files. As before, Apple offers 5GB of free iCloud storage -- a bit skimpy considering Microsoft and Google each hand out 15 gigs. On the bright side, Apple has lowered the prices on its data plans so that they're now roughly the same price as what you'd pay for extra Google storage: 200GB for $4 and so on. Even then, Google is sometimes the better deal: It offers a terabyte for $10, for instance, whereas Apple charges $20 for the same amount of space. On the desktop, at least, iCloud Drive is like a mash-up of Dropbox and Finder. Just drag files into the iCloud Drive folder, listed in the left sidebar in Finder. Then, if you felt like it, you could organize the files with tags and subfolders. Easy peasy. It's on the mobile side that iCloud Drive suddenly becomes less intuitive. Right now, at least, Apple doesn't have a standalone Drive app for mobile devices, the way Microsoft and Google do with their respective services. Instead, you have to go into one of Apple's own mobile apps, like Pages, and then open the file as you normally would. Alternatively, you can always go to iCloud.com, but going to a website on your mobile device is hardly a substitute for a proper standalone app. Family Sharing While we're on the subject of cloud storage, Yosemite and iOS 8 usher in a new feature called Family Sharing, which lets you share App Store purchases for up to six accounts, even if you have different Apple IDs. (Amazon recently introduced a nearly identical feature on its own Kindle Fire tablets.) In addition to iTunes purchases, you can also share things like photos and family calendars. Lastly, Apple's new \"Ask to Buy\" feature should go a long way in preventing kids from racking up unwanted App Store bills. I don't have kids myself, but for my friends' sake, I'm very glad Apple added this. To set up Family Sharing on your Mac, you'll need to go to System Preferences, iCloud and then \"Manage Family.\" Specifically, you'll have to name yourself the organizer, so to speak, as well as designate a stored payment option. This seems a bit redundant, considering you probably already have a credit card attached to your Apple account, but hey: At least this step is quick. Spotlight If you already own a Mac or iPhone, then you're well familiar with Spotlight, the built-in search tool that has, until now, let you search for files, emails and anything else you have stored on your device. With the introduction of both iOS 8 and Yosemite, though, the search tool has gotten quite a bit smarter. Now, when you search Spotlight, you'll see previews for Wikipedia entries, Bing search results, contacts and any iTunes purchases you have on your computer. It can also serve up local search results like movie times and maps, provided you have \"Spotlight Suggestions\" enabled in system settings. Lastly, the new Spotlight does unit conversions -- things like distance, currency and so on. In particular, I appreciate how tidy the search results are. Whereas Spotlight used to sit in the menu bar with drop-down results, it now takes the form of a search bar that pops up in the middle of your screen (you can either press the search icon in the menu bar or hit Command-Space bar). The Spotlight bar opens on top of windows, so you don't have to minimize what you're working on. As you start to type, the search tool will offer auto-complete suggestions to make things easier. From there, you can act on certain things from the search results -- open an address in Maps, for example, or click an email address to start composing a message. All told, then, the new search tool is quite useful. My only request: Add the ability to get to specific system settings, like you can in Windows 8. Safari It's a similar situation with Safari. Apple's built-in web browser now shows search results that mirror Spotlight -- everything from movie times to Wikipedia previews. (Note: For reasons that remain unclear, not every region will have this feature, though the US is, of course, included.) In keeping with Yosemite's new, flat design aesthetic, the layout here is much cleaner, too. Click the URL bar (the \"Smart Search Field\") to see a pop-up with your favorites. In the toolbar, everything is now arranged in one line (the option to show the side pane used to be one level down). The \"Reader mode\" button also has a new design -- just one of many small design tweaks you'll find throughout the OS. Meanwhile, a new tabs view shows tabs from your Mac and iOS device (there's a tabs button for this). My favorite part is that the tabs are stacked in instances where you opened multiple pages from the same site -- it goes a long way in reducing clutter. Additionally, you can close tabs remotely, so long as the remote device is running either Yosemite or iOS 8 (if all you want to do is open remote tabs, you just need iOS 6 or higher, or Mavericks on the desktop side). Finally, Safari's \"share\" button now shows recent shares. It's also \"extensible,\" which is to say you can add extensions to share via more apps, even if they aren't part of the default sharing menu. In addition, Apple made a few privacy and performance improvements. For starters, DuckDuckGo is now one of four preset search engines, with Google, Yahoo and Bing being the other three. You can also now open private browsing in a new window, even if you already started a regular browsing session in a different window. (In Mavericks, once you turn on private browsing, you're turning it on for every subsequent window and tab you open.) The private browsing window is also easy to tell apart, with a \"private browsing enabled\" banner and a lock symbol in the address bar. It's also now easier to specify a time period for clearing your browser history -- specifically, you get the option of \"last hour,\" \"today\" or \"today and yesterday.\" Speaking of history, by the way, you can see your history for all of your iCloud devices, not just the Mac you happen to be working on. Finally, there's a stronger cookie option: \"Allow from current website only,\" which excludes cookies even from sites you've visited before. Meanwhile, on the performance side, this is the first version of Safari to support the WebGL standard. In fact, performance overall should be a touch faster, thanks to a new JavaScript engine. Apple also claims this edition is a little gentler on battery life -- you should get up to three more hours of Netflix streaming here than on Chrome or Firefox, or at least that's what Apple says. Messages Apple's built-in Messages app has also gotten an upgrade. Basically, it's picked up many of the same features as Messages in iOS 8, which is to say you can now mute, leave or add participants to a conversation. Unfortunately, as I said in my preview, you need to already have at least three people in the conversation to do any of these things. That kind of makes sense for muting and leaving a thread -- you don't wanna just leave someone hanging -- but I don't see why two people having a conversation can't add a third. What if Terrence and I are about to go to the bar and think Edgar should come too? Could happen, right? Moving on, you can also name individual conversations, if you're so popular that even your SMS list needs organization. Additionally, if your texting partner is using iOS 8 and has elected to share their location, you can view a map inside the Messages app that shows where your friend is -- a useful tool if you're struggling to find each other in a crowded area. Meanwhile, a Camera Roll-type stream now sits on the right side of the Messages app, showing all the photos and videos you and your friends have uploaded to the thread. (Yes, this includes a mix of images from Macs and iOS devices.) As on iOS 8, there's a new \"Soundbites\" feature allowing you to attach an audio clip up to 100MB. From there, senders and recipients can both choose to either keep the message, or let it expire after two minutes, \u00e0 la Snapchat. Finally, a new feature in Yosemite allows you to start a screen-sharing session between Macs with someone who you've already conversed with on iMessage. Mail The Mail app looks the same as it did on the previous version of OS X, but hidden in there are three new features you should know about. The first is Mail Drop, which helps you skirt attachment-size limits by storing large files (up to 5GB) in iCloud instead. It's not even an option you have to look for in the settings; if you try to upload a large-enough file, you'll see a pop-up asking if you'd like to use Mail Drop instead. Assuming you do that, the attachment will be encrypted on Apple's servers, and no, it won't count against your iCloud storage. If the recipient of your message also happens to have a Yosemite machine, the attachment will just download automatically, without the user having to do anything. If your friend doesn't have Yosemite, they can click a download link, which will be available for 30 days. Meanwhile, Apple also added smarter suggestions in the Mail app's search field. In particular, it now does a better job recognizing typos, and suggests results based on what it thinks you were trying to say. Not a life-changing feature -- it doesn't take long to retype \"burgers\" when you originally wrote \"bugrers\" -- but it's certainly nice to have. Last thing: A new \"Markup\" feature lets you add shapes and text to email attachments, complete with formatting options like fonts and text colors. Just hover over a PDF or image after you insert it into your draft email, and click on the \"Markup\" option that'll appear over on the right side. You can also sign documents by either writing with your finger, or using your Mac's iSight camera to photograph your signature on a piece of paper. Meanwhile, if you wanted to really home in on something, there's an option to zoom in on a specific part of the document and crop everything else out. Finally, you can draw on the document, at which point Markup will attempt to smooth out your scribblings if you happen to make a shape it recognizes. If you dash out a crooked arrow sign, for instance, Apple will give you the option of swapping in a straight, more professional-looking one instead (you can also keep the crooked one, if you prefer). Calendar and Notification Center I saved this section for last because of all the changes in OS X Yosemite, the tweaks to Calendar and Notification Center were perhaps the most minor. In Calendar, the only new thing is a day view, with an inline, full-height inspection pane, where you can see things like a map of your appointment location, the local weather and a list of attendees. Similarly, the Notification Center now has a \"Today\" view, which you can customize with widgets from the Mac App Store (calendar, weather, stocks, world clock, reminders, social networking, et cetera). Additionally, Apple released an API to developers, so they can tweak their own apps for the Notification Center too, if they want to. In practice, it functions kind of like the old Dashboard, though you can still go there too, if you're averse to change. Personally, I find the Notification Center is simply easier to access -- you can either click the icon in the upper-right corner of the screen, or swipe in from the right with two fingers. Wrap-up In theory, Apple's OS X Yosemite update is for everybody. And in a way, it is -- almost anyone can download it for free, so long as they have a Mac that came out sometime in the last five years or so. In reality, though, this release is mainly for people who own an iDevice, whether it's an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. All of the most compelling features -- Handoff, iMessage integration, shared browser history, the ability to receive calls on your computer -- are reserved specifically for iOS users. For people like me, who own an Android phone and use Microsoft OneDrive for storage, this is a more modest upgrade. That said, even those of you who dabble in multiple OSes will appreciate the flat new design, Spotlight search and improved Safari layout. Just accept the fact that you're not getting as much out of the new operating system as you could be. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: apple, os x, os x yosemite, osx, osxyosemite, review, uk-reviews, yosemite \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20976156 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20976156\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/apple/os-x/yosemite/\"> Apple OS X Yosemite </a> Apple OS X Yosemite Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/apple/os-x/yosemite/\" title=\"Apple OS X Yosemite reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 26 </a> Prices Discussions Type Computer OS Source model Closed, w/ open source Architecture 64-bit Released 2014-10-16 see all specs \u2192 5.2average user rating Ease of use 6.5 Speed 6.2 Configurability 6.1 Ecosystem (apps, drivers, etc.) 6 Openness 4.9 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 37 Let's talk about the WWDC keynote right here! 12 How to install OS X Yosemite inside VirtualBox 2 What happened to the menu bars?

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/12/microsoft-band-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "November 12th 2014 at 4:00 pm", "body": " There are generally two schools of thought on how to build a wrist-borne wearable. Either make a fancy pedometer that's supposed to stay out of the way, or go the smartwatch route and cram in as many features as possible. Then there's this weird no-man's-land occupied by devices like the Samsung Gear Fit and Garmin Vivosmart. Microsoft's $200 Band falls squarely in that latter category. It's not quite a smartwatch, but it's not purely a fitness tracker like the Fitbit Flex. The Band can pull in emails, text messages and other notifications from your phone. If you're using a Windows Phone, it can control Cortana and put the power of Microsoft's virtual assistant on your wrist. But it is, to hear Microsoft tell it, a fitness device first. And to that end Microsoft has packed the Band full of sensors, ranging from heart rate, to GPS and the prerequisite accelerometer. And, most importantly, it's the first device to tie into the new Microsoft Health platform, which seeks to outgun offerings like Apple Health and Google Fit. But, as we all know, there are inherent dangers in trying to carve out a third path. The question ultimately is whether Microsoft has built something (both physically and figuratively) that combines all of the most compelling parts of the existing wearable scene. Or, if it's created a sort of Frankenstein's monster that suffers all of their weaknesses. Gallery | 25 Photos Microsoft Band review + See all 25 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 65 Microsoft Band Pros Works on iOS, Android and Windows Phone Lots of data, thanks to a raft of sensors App has a clean design and shows promise Connects to Cortana on Windows Phone Guided workouts are extremely helpful Cons Hardware is uncomfortable and poorly designed Microsoft Health is mostly promise Smartwatch-like battery life Does too many things, many of them poorly Seriously, the Band is really uncomfortable Summary If Microsoft Health ever lives up to its ambitious goals, it could be game-changing. But right now, the Microsoft Band is the only device available for it. And the Band seems more like a prototype than a consumer device. It's bulky, uncomfortable and has disappointing battery life. You could get a comfortable fitness tracker for less, or a capable smartwatch for a few bucks more. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware I wear a watch -- like a real analog watch -- most days. I've also worn a few Fitbits and spent the better part of a couple of weeks with a Jawbone Up on my wrist. None of these things quite compares to the discomfort of strapping on the Microsoft Band. It's bulky and stiff, with odd proportions and protrusions in poorly thought-out places. The screen layout and placement of the buttons all but insist you wear the Band on your dominant hand, with the display on the inside of your wrist, which is a tad awkward. Plus, that position puts the screen in constant danger. Within two days, the device was so scratched-up it looked as if I'd been wearing it for years while living in the wilderness. In short, Microsoft's Band is an ergonomic nightmare. Part of the problem is the simply audacious ambition at work here. Microsoft likes to brag about how there are a total of 10 sensors in the wearable, including GPS. Plus there's a surprisingly bright 1.4-inch screen. And, despite all this, the quoted battery life is still two days. And, truth be told you can get two full days of use... so long as you don't actually fire up that GPS. But, if I'm being honest, even that is not enough. If I'm to think about the Band as a fitness tracker, rather than a smartwatch, it should at least match the five-plus days of battery life promised by most of its competitors. Microsoft's Band is an ergonomic nightmare. In the end, it simply seems impossible that Microsoft could have made the Band any smaller or more comfortable without giving up at least a few of its sensors (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, capacitive, skin temperature, ultraviolet light, ambient light, optical heart rate, microphone, galvanic skin response). But even if the company insisted on keeping all the same electronics, it seems there's still plenty of room for improvement. For one, the relatively wide, flat screen means the Band is a pretty inflexible semicircle. A curved screen like the one found on the Galaxy Fit might add a few bucks to the cost, but the additional comfort would be priceless. Then there's the material selection itself. There's little to no give to the Band, and there are even raised, hard plastic pieces that rest against the side of your wrist. They don't dig into your arm, but they're certainly not the most pleasant-feeling thing in the world. And don't even get me started on trying to sleep with the thing. It feels less like a sleep tracker and more like you've been placed under house arrest. Software Thankfully Microsoft Health, while still rough around the edges, is quite a bit more successful in realizing its goal. Let's start with the most immediate and obvious leg up it has on the competition: compatibility. Microsoft Health is available on Windows Phone, obviously, but also on iOS and Android (4.3 or higher with Bluetooth 4.0). And the experience across all three platforms is pretty much the same. In fact, the only major difference I could spot was Cortana support on Microsoft's OS. Otherwise you get the same selection of large tiles with summaries of your sleep, steps, exercise and calories burned. Tap any of those tiles and you can dig deeper into the data. Wondering whether it was mile three or mile four of your run when you really hit your stride? Microsoft Health can tell you. Want to know when you're the most restless at night? That's in there too. Along with your heart rate over the course of your slumber. (Clearly that spike to 130 BPM at around 3AM means I had some sort of night terror, right?) Microsoft promises that's just the tip of the iceberg as well. As the company gathers more data, both about you and the population at large, it'll be able to put its powerful machine learning to better use. The UV sensor could eventually alert you when it's prudent to put on sunscreen, then use the GPS to remind you to pick some up when you're near a store. The heart rate monitor could also sense a rise in your anxiety level, and perhaps suggest you hold off on the caffeine before a meeting with your boss. Microsoft Health can already tell you how much recovery you need after exercising, although it is a tad conservative -- I definitely didn't need 58 hours of rest after running four miles. Still, it's clear that \"health\" is defined quite broadly by Microsoft, and the future of its platform is as much about lifestyle as it is about fitness. Microsoft's ambition is apparent in the software as well. Beyond just counting steps, the Band can alert you to incoming calls, emails, texts, Facebook messages or Twitter mentions. If that's not enough, you can just turn on the catchall notification alerts, which puts anything that pops up on your phone on your wrist. Still, that quickly gets annoying as app updates and other nonsense starts piling up. The other big issue with notifications is that they don't really sync with your phone. Once a text message is pushed to your wrist, you can't get rid of it. Incoming messages live on indefinitely on the Band, even after the notification has been cleared and the message deleted on your phone. And, unless you're on a Windows Phone, the alert is completely passive (save for a few pre-programmed responses you can trigger for text messages). You can only reply if you're hooked into Cortana. And for now that feature is limited to text messages, email replies will be added later. Honestly, after the first couple of days, I just ended up removing those tiles from my Band and focused on the fitness functions. You can customize the layout in both the app and on the Band, thankfully. So, if you're not particularly concerned with how many steps you took, but still want to know how many calories you've burned, you can clear out the clutter. Or if you're most interested in your Twitter alerts, you can move that to the top of the list. Basically you can put as much or as little data as you want at your fingertips. You can even see your activity trends over the course of the week. And, for an added dash of personalization you can pick the color and background of your choice for the Band's interface. Gallery | 23 Photos Microsoft Health mobile app + See all 23 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") One of the most unique features of the Microsoft Health app, though, is guided workouts. Using the app, you can upload any number of workout routines to the Band from sources like Gold's Gym, Men's Fitness or even Microsoft itself. Knowing what to do once you get to the gym is a struggle for some, and this takes the guesswork out of it. The screen tells you what exercise you should be doing and uses the various sensors to count reps. When it's time to rest or move on to the next set, the Band vibrates to get your attention. And at the end, you get a nice summary of how much time or how many reps you performed, plus the calories burned. The competition On the hardware front, competitors are coming at Microsoft from all sides. Garmin's Vivosmart delivers much of the same functionality for $170, though it lacks GPS and a heart rate monitor. Then there's the new Basis Peak, which automatically detects when you're sleeping or exercising. And it will soon deliver notifications to your wrist thanks to an upcoming software update. There's also the ever-increasing number of true smartwatches on the market from the likes of Motorola, LG and Samsung that are able to deliver most of the same features, plus a much more robust notification system. Still, they suffer from extremely poor battery life and a significantly higher price tag. Meanwhile, established fitness players like Jawbone and Fitbit have new wearables hitting the scene that undercut the Band on price while offering the comfort of familiarity (not to mention impressive battery life). Newcomers like Jaybird are even trying to offer their own takes on the \"insight\" angle. In Jaybird's case, it's offering Go-Zone, which tells you when your body is ready for exercise or when you should be taking it easy. Of course, most of these options lack the smartwatch-esque features of the Band. That being said, their focus on fitness is their greatest strength. Microsoft Health is the real star of the show here. Then there's Microsoft Health, which, if you ask me, is the real star of the show here. The Band is just a vehicle through which to spread awareness of Redmond's new platform that promises to leverage machine learning to provide valuable insights about your health. Plus, it promises to do these things regardless of whether you prefer iOS, Android or Windows Phone. Its competitors, Apple Health and Google Fit, are tied to their platform of origin -- iOS and Android, respectively. And neither of those efforts seems nearly as ambitious. While it appears inevitable that Google will use the data it collects to offer similar features to those promised by Microsoft, for the moment Mountain View offers little more than an archive of your steps. On the other hand, Microsoft Health already suggests how much recovery time I should take after exercising. Down to the second. Wrap-up Despite having spent the last three years in development, the Band still feels like a proof of concept. The abundance of tech crammed inside makes it seem like Microsoft was focused on showing off all the capabilities of its new health-tracking platform, rather than on building a consumer-friendly wearable. If Microsoft were to sell the Band as some sort of demo unit for OEMs or a developer device, its physical faults would be forgivable. But the company insists that the Band is also a consumer-ready product and I couldn't disagree more. The Band still feels like a proof of concept. That being said, Microsoft seems to be on to something with its Health platform. The software still has some kinks, and it's unclear how close the company is to delivering on its ambitious promises. But the focus is right. Rather than worrying too much about how many steps you took or how many calories you ate, Microsoft Health aims to provide insight into your broader well-being. That could mean helping you avoid skin cancer, or taking care of that balky knee you insist on running on. There's obviously room to grow, but compared to its primary competitors -- which happen to be locked to a single mobile platform -- Microsoft Health seems to have the most promise. Besides, this is just the first of what Microsoft is hoping will be many devices to tie into its Health platform. Redmond is even willing to license both the hardware and software to manufacturers who should be able to improve on this initial design. So, who knows, maybe in a few months Samsung will release its own take on the Band. One that cuts the fat and delivers on the promise of Microsoft Health.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/14/nvidia-shield-tablet-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "August 14th 2014 at 4:20 pm", "body": " NVIDIA's Shield gaming handheld was a peculiar, singular device: an expensive Android portable aimed squarely at consumers that had already purchased high-end desktop GPUs. It was novel and fun, but it wasn't for everybody: If you weren't a gamer, there wasn't much point to owning a Shield. Now, that's changing: NVIDIA's second-generation gaming device isn't a quirky handheld; it's a tablet. Specifically, the Shield tablet is a $299 8-inch gaming slate powered by NVIDIA's new Tegra K1 processor. It wants to be everything to everyone: a high-end gaming device, a superb media tablet and a performance benchmark that will drive the mobile industry forward. Most of all, it wants to appeal to more than just the hardcore gamer. Does it? Let's find out.

But the high price tag leaves a sting since you can't use it with anything but those NVIDIA devices. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Black, green and silver were the colors that defined the original Shield, but this year's model is decidedly more monochrome: The slate is draped in a mix of glossy and reflective blacks. It's a clean, if less distinctive, look, but the absence of color doesn't mean the Shield is just another cookie-cutter tablet. If anything, it looks more like an HTC One than a Nexus 7, sporting long, matte black speakers on the device's top and bottom edges. The top speaker bar is split in half by a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with an same shooter (sans autofocus) on the rear of the device. Let's not flip the tablet over just yet, though -- a handful of ports, holes and buttons run around the edges. Most of the action is on the right: a power button, volume toggles, a microSD slot and an embedded, passive stylus for pen input. The WiFi model also features a walled-in cutout for a micro-SIM card slot -- an ever-present reminder that you could have purchased the LTE model (more on that device below). The bottom edge is host to a simple bass speaker vent, while the left side is marked only by the magnetic connectors that latch onto an optional screen cover. The top has a little more going on: another bass vent, a headphone jack, micro-HDMI connectivity and the all-important power/micro-USB port. Oh, and that backside? Just a smooth, matte surface accented only by the word \"Shield,\" etched in glossy black lettering. Classy. Although the tablet feels sturdy and well-built, it isn't perfect. Putting all of the Shield's ports on one half of the top edge leaves it feeling a little crowded, and thumbing its physical toggles gave me second thoughts about its build quality. It's not that it feels cheap or painful to hold (a tiny, chamfered edge between the screen and tablet sides ensures a comfortable grip), but the buttons' tactile response is a little mushy. The soft depressions are okay for tweaking volume, but I was never sure if I was using the power button correctly. Did it go down all the way? Did I miss it? Until the screen reacted, I just couldn't tell. The tablet's folding, magnetic cover (sold separately) soon became my favorite way of waking the device: just flip it open, and the screen is on. Looking for precise specs? Okay, we've got those, too: The Shield tablet measures 8.8 inches (221mm) long, five inches (126mm) wide and 0.35 inch (9.2mm) thick. For comparison's sake, that makes it taller, wider and thicker than the Nexus 7 -- though it does sport a larger 8-inch, 1,920 x 1,200 display. Weighing in at 390g (13.7 ounces) it's a bit heavier, too, though it's still lighter than both versions of the Kindle Fire HD. If you were to crack the Shield open (please don't), you'd find NVIDIA's latest mobile chip: a 192-core Kepler GPU paired with a 2.2GHz quad-core Cortex-A15 processor. The Tegra K1 is the company's pride and joy (at least for now; a 64-bit variant is currently in development). It features a mobile GPU designed specifically to push the limits of Android and offer \"PC class\" and \"modern console class\" graphics on a small screen (more on that later). The tablet also packs 2GB of RAM, 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi with 2.4GHz and 5GHz support, Bluetooth 4.0 LE and a GPS radio. Right now, the Shield can be had only as a WiFi tablet with 16GB of storage, but NVIDIA plans to offer an LTE version later this year, which will come with twice the storage space and access to five LTE bands (2/4/5/7/17) and four HSPA+ bands (1/2/4/5). It'll be unlocked, too, but heavy users may be tempted to wait just for the extra storage. Because really, it doesn't take long to fill up 16GB -- especially on a device geared toward gaming. 9/30/2014 Update: As of today, that LTE model is officially available; see the \"Gaming over LTE\" section below for more details. Display and sound The Shield tablet's 8-inch, 283-ppi, 1,920 x 1,200 IPS screen may not be the brightest or sharpest tablet display, but I was hard-pressed to find a legitimate complaint. Contrast, color quality and a 380-nit brightness were all more than enough for indoor use, though like most glossy displays, it can be difficult to read in direct sunlight. Still, it has clear, balanced colors, great contrast and wide viewing angles. I read a half-dozen comics, watched a movie and played hours of games without thinking twice about the display quality. Earlier, I made a point of calling out the Shield's speakers. They were the first thing I noticed about the tablet, and with good reason: Their design enables a true hand-held stereo experience. It's an exception to an irksome standard; many tablets and smartphones cripple themselves by banishing their speakers to one end of the device, making stereo sound separation impossible. Considering how much media we consume on these devices, that's just unacceptable. Thankfully, NVIDIA got it right, placing a speaker on each end of the tablet. So, how does it sound? Just okay. The Shield's speakers don't crackle or distort, but they aren't incredibly loud either. The sound is balanced, and good overall, but it won't fill a room and it definitely can't replace a good set of headphones. This makes the Shield tablet's audio experience a little mixed: It's not as loud as its predecessor, but its speakers aren't as tinny either. At the end of the day, however, the tablet's design makes it impossible to accidentally \"block\" the speakers by holding the device \"incorrectly,\" and that's worth at least some credit. Direct Stylus 2.0 One of the best ways to add value to a tablet is to bake in stylus support. The problem is, active, pressure-sensitive pens (e.g., the Wacom tech used in the Samsung Galaxy Note) are expensive. Passive stylus technology is cheap, but offers an inferior pen experience. NVIDIA's solution was to create Direct Stylus: a carefully designed passive pen that mimics an active stylus via clever software tricks and a little GPU wizardry. This not-so-active stylus first showed up in the Tegra Note 7, but NVIDIA gave it an upgrade on the Shield, renaming it Direct Stylus 2.0. That numerical identifier mostly adds up to a redesigned pen, starting with a longer, narrower tip that curves slightly. That's important because whereas most styli imprint a dot-like shape on the surface of the tablet's screen, this pen leaves more of an apostrophe. The added surface area might make the pen more accurate, but most of the pen's performance improvements can be chalked up to better software. The Shield's best showcase of this is Dabbler, a painting app that leverages the tablet's GPU to simulate the effect of paint on real materials. I am not an artist. Dabbler is actually quite impressive -- it takes the type of paint, material, lighting and even the tablet's position into account. A line drawn in the app's watercolor mode, for instance, will slowly soak into the surface of the simulated paper, and will even bleed down into other sections of the material if the app's \"gravity\" mode is turned on. Similarly, oil paints can glob and cake up on the surface of a canvas, and the artist can change the direction of the light source to affect how the final painting looks. It's a neat concept, but it's short on features: There aren't many tool or paint styles to choose from, and it lacks the simulated pressure sensitivity that the technology is capable of. While I'm not much of a fine artist myself, I did find writing with the stylus to be a pleasure. The passive pen worked well enough in notebook apps like Evernote and JusWrite, but I was most impressed by its handwriting recognition. My childish penmanship -- said to be unreadable by my K-12 teachers, college professors and employers -- was consistently recognized by the Shield's software. This feature can be used in any app that accepts text input, too: All you have to do is hold down the spacebar for a second and switch to the handwriting keyboard. Pretty smooth. Shield Wireless Controller The Shield makes a nice standalone tablet, but let's not kid ourselves: If you want to get any serious gaming done on this device, you're going to need a controller. Don't worry, NVIDIA has you covered. Introducing the Shield Wireless Controller, a $60 WiFi gamepad that promises lower latency than your average Android controller. It isn't the only option Shield buyers have (the tablet also connects to any Bluetooth gamepad), but it has the advantage of being designed specifically for Shield devices. This means it has a few extra features -- namely, a clickable mousepad and a dedicated NVIDIA button (for launching the NVIDIA hub). That first feature may seem like an odd thing to tack onto a gaming controller, but for the Shield, it makes a lot of sense. One of the device's flagship features is NVIDIA GameStream, its ability to wirelessly stream high-end PC games directly from a GeForce GTX-powered Windows machine -- but desktop games don't always play nicely with the streaming setup. Some have mouse-operated launcher menus, or refuse to recognize the gamepad until the user activates a specific setting. The official gamepad's mousing surface makes it easy to navigate these menus without fiddling with the tablet's touchscreen or the host computer itself. It's a little under-sensitive (NVIDIA says it's working on this), but still convenient. It's compatible with the original Shield too. All told, it's the perfect companion for either device when connected to a TV in console mode. The rest of the gamepad looks pretty standard: two analog thumbsticks, a directional pad, four face buttons, two bumpers and a pair of triggers. It's a good-feeling controller -- like an oversized Xbox 360 pad with the PlayStation thumbstick layout -- but it's hardly a revolution in gamepad design. The only standard it's missing is force feedback vibration, though it does have a few other bells and whistles: volume controls, a built-in mic and a headset jack that pipes in all audio from the tablet. Unfortunately, the microphone only works in Android: Games streamed from the PC simply won't recognize it. While it's handy to have an internal microphone for Twitch streaming, I found that it had an annoying tendency to pick up button presses and other controller noises. If you're planning to stream your gameplay, use a headset. Finally, the controller has one more quirk: capacitive start, back and Android home buttons. These touch-sensitive toggles are a little odd at first, but considering they're designed for an Android tablet, they feel fine. They also pull double-duty: Long-pressing the back or start buttons often brings up context-sensitive menus, and it doesn't take long to get used to them. My only disappointment with Shield's wireless controller is how single-minded it is -- it works like a dream with NVIDIA's own hardware, but wiring it up to your computer to use as a standard gamepad produces null results. I expected this, sure, but having an extra PC controller would have been a nice perk. Software The Shield runs a version of Android 4.4.2 that's pretty close to stock, although NVIDIA did manage to weave in a few extra features. The best of these, without a doubt, is the tablet's integrated Twitch support: Pull down the notification menu at any time, in any app, and you can immediately stream your tablet's screen, microphone and front-facing camera to Twitch. Technically, this is the tablet's \"share\" menu, and it's the mobile equivalent of NVIDIA's GeForce Experience ShadowPlay feature. The pop-up menu can stream to Twitch, capture the last five minutes of screen time, manually record the screen and save it to memory or simply take a screenshot. The menu can also be called up with a long-press on the gamepad's back button too, making it easy to access in any situation. The whole thing is robust, beautiful and seamlessly integrated into the OS. Most of the OS' other tweaks are carryovers from previous products. Holding the gamepad's start button will bring up NVIDIA's gamepad mapper, for instance. This overlay allows you to create virtual \"touch\" spaces that you can manipulate with the gamepad, making it possible for any game with touch controls to be played with the controller. Making profiles can be a little tedious, but almost every game already has a mapping sourced from the community, which can be downloaded with the touch of a button. The DirectStylus features found in the Tegra Note slate are here too -- pulling out the pen brings up a menu of compatible apps, and additional buttons can be added to the navigation bar for quick access to stylus-exclusive controls. These are all nice tweaks to the OS, but the true Shield experience hinges on launching the Shield Hub app, formerly known as \"TegraZone.\" Despite the rebranding, the Shield Hub is largely the same experience NVIDIA baked into (and repeatedly updated for) its last portable gaming device. It's basically the device's \"console\" interface, a launcher for all of the Shield's gaming functions. There's a store section that redirects to the Google Play page for featured and optimized games, a news feed for NVIDIA announcements and disparate app drawers for Android games, media apps and PC games. There are search and settings options in NVIDIA's menu, too, but these just kick the user back to the standard Android interface. While the NVIDIA hub isn't technically new, it's gone through several major overhauls since its introduction on the original Shield. It's better designed, easier to navigate with a controller and generally more pleasing to the eye. In fact, when the tablet is connected to a television, it almost feels like a proper console OS -- although the controller has a mouse emulator for a reason. It still isn't perfect, but it's come a long way. Camera In general, tablets shouldn't be used as your primary camera for capturing life's precious moments: They're big, awkward and shooting pictures with them makes you look silly. You shouldn't do it, ever -- and you definitely shouldn't do it with NVIDIA's Shield tablet. Not only will you look ridiculous, but also your pictures will turn out lousy. The Shield's rear-facing 5-megapixel shooter is mediocre at best. The Shield can produce clear, if muted images in a well-lit interior space, but it stumbles in darker rooms and the great outdoors. The camera simply can't compromise between shadows and highlights, and blows out images in the presence of any bright surface. My test shots are full of over-brightened flowers that bleed together and soft images lacking texture depth. The Shield's rear-facing camera will probably do in a pinch, but chances are it's outclassed by your smartphone. Gallery | 16 Photos NVIDIA Shield camera samples + See all 16 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") Most tablets skimp on the front-facing camera, opting for a lower-resolution sensor. Not the Shield, though. The tablet's front camera is the very same as the rear one. It still won't land you any award-winning shots, but I can appreciate the higher-resolution selfie cam for the sake of the device's Twitch integration: If you're going to stream your face to the internet, it may as well be shot with the best camera available. Performance and battery life Ask NVIDIA about its new Tegra K1 mobile processor and it'll beam at you like a proud parent. This is a mobile GPU boasting 192 Kepler cores and the wherewithal to keep up with PC gaming standards: Open GL, DirectX 12 and even support for Unreal Engine 4. Kepler is the key buzzword here: Tegra K1 is built on the same architecture that powers NVIDIA's desktop-class GPUs. Combined with a 2.2GHz quad-core Cortex-A15 processor (with an extra \"+1\" core to handle menial, low-power tasks), the Shield runs on what NVIDIA is claiming to be the \"world's fastest mobile processor.\" NVIDIA Shield Tablet Tegra Note 7 Nexus 7 Samsung Galaxy Tab S Quadrant 2.0 20,556 16,066 6,133 18,597 Vellamo 3,055 3,314 1,597 1,672 3DMark IS Unlimited 30,970 16,473 10,271 12,431 SunSpider 1.0 (ms) 463 586 602 1,109 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 31 N/A 5 5.5 CF-Bench 43,033 34,386 15,366 31,695 SunSpider: Lower scores are better. All told, the NVIDIA Shield tablet is delightfully fast, offering one of the smoothest, most stutter-free experiences I've ever had with an Android tablet. Switching between apps and menus feels fluid, and even processor-heavy applications load in mere seconds (not including extra loading time for high-end games, of course). More often than not, I found myself waiting on my network connection to catch up to the device -- slowly watching a status bar as it downloaded the next issue of the comic I was reading or waiting for a server to deliver my web page. If you're hooked on numbers, take a look at the table above: The Shield made notched marks in every single benchmark. The Shield kept pace with average battery life expectancies, too: It lasted for nine hours of near-constant use, including a good deal of comics reading and Netflix streaming. Engadget's battery rundown test (video looping at a fixed brightness) matched my lazy-Sunday test pretty closely; the 5,300mAh battery gave out after almost eight and a half hours. With lighter usage, the Shield can also last for a day and a half or more without needing a recharge. That's about an hour more than last year's Nexus tablet, but it's hardly best in class -- the Shield still falls four hours short of Samsung's 8-inch Galaxy Tab S. Tablet Battery Life NVIDIA Shield Tablet 8:23 Microsoft Surface 2 14:22 (LTE) Apple iPad Air 13:45 (LTE) Samsung Galaxy Tab S (10-inch) 12:30 Samsung Galaxy Tab S (8-inch) 12:22 Apple iPad mini with Retina display 11:55 (LTE) Amazon Kindle Fire HDX (7-inch) 10:41 (WiFi) Nexus 7 (2012) 9:49 Kindle Fire HD (8.9-inch) 9:01 Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet (2012) 7:57 Nexus 7 (2013) 7:15 Gaming This is why you're really here, right? Yes, the Shield makes an admirable media tablet, but that's not why NVIDIA built it. This is a device billed as the \"ultimate gaming tablet,\" a slate to take mobile gaming to a new level. That's pretty much the same promise NVIDIA gave us with the original Shield. Does the tablet form factor and the company's new Tegra K1 processor make that much of a difference? Yes, and no -- it kind of depends on what your goal is. While it's true the tablet's Tegra K1 outclasses the Tegra 4 chip found in the hand-held Shield, it's hard to tell in most games. With the exception of a few NVIDIA-optimized titles, most Android games simply aren't designed with high-performance graphics chips in mind. Titles like Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode II, Grand Theft Auto III or Jet Set Radio aren't going to look appreciably different on either device -- though all of them run great. In fact, the only titles where we could see any notable difference were ones designed specifically for NVIDIA Shield devices -- namely, Valve's Android ports of Portal and Half-Life 2. Valve's classic shooter and Stockholm Syndrome puzzler made their way to the NVIDIA Shield handheld back in May, but they were slightly downgraded ports. Both games suffered occasional lag in tense moments and lacked more robust lighting effects. They're still playable on NVIDIA's original Shield, but on the tablet, they're a bit better. Textures seem to be a bit more crisp and dynamic lighting now reflects off of in-game surfaces. Most importantly, the games run more smoothly and stutter less often. While these games do look better on the Shield tablet, they're available on the older device as well. That said, tablet-exclusive games are coming. Trine 2, for instance, ships with every Shield tablet and requires a Tegra K1 processor to run. It looks pretty fantastic too, and features textures and lighting on par with the game's console and PC ports. Sadly, it's only a hint of the power the K1 has to offer. NVIDIA has shown impressive demos of the processor (and indeed, the Shield tablet itself) featuring stunning graphics powered by Unreal Engine 4, but no top-tier games take advantage of this power. In fact, the only UE4 game currently available for the device is Tappy Chicken, a simple clone game created as an example of a scripting system. Is the NVIDIA Shield tablet the most powerful Android gaming device available? Probably, but right now that power is underutilized. It's a problem the original Shield device faced too -- a bizarre, but tantalizingly capable product with precious few apps that could leverage its power. While it's true that NVIDIA is continually pushing to get more Tegra-optimized games on the market, the fact of the matter is that these titles trickle out at an inconsistent pace. Fortunately, Shield owners aren't shackled by the limits of the Android marketplace. GameStream and Console Mode Both the NVIDIA Shield tablet and hand-held Shield are powerful, well-made Android devices, but let's be frank: The aforementioned GameStream technology is easily half the reason gamers are buying these products. We covered the feature in our original Shield review, but it's worth revisiting -- it's the device's killer app, and it's better than ever. Over the past year, NVIDIA has slowly been pushing updates to its existing Shield handheld, improving its PC-streaming features and building a smoother experience. Naturally, these updates have found their way to the tablet, and it shows: GameStream is noticeably more reliable than it was a year ago. It has lower latency and crashes less often (hardly at all, in fact). It's not perfect, but most of the time input lag was low enough that I don't notice it. On my home network, the experience was good enough that I could almost hold my own in Titanfall over GameStream. That's a huge improvement. Streaming PC games to a tablet is OK, but I found the experience to be more enjoyable on a big screen. Plugging a micro-HDMI cable into the Shield prompts it to reboot into \"console mode,\" disabling the tablet screen and optimizing video output for your television (there's also a mirror mode, but this leaves Android's navigation buttons on your TV screen). With NVIDIA's updated Tegra Hub and the official Shield gamepad, this setup works like a dream. The Tegra Hub serves as an easy-to-navigate, well-thought-out console interface, and the controller's aforementioned touchpad makes it easy to sort out PC-streaming problems (unexpected pop-up windows and the like) from the couch. Technically, this experience was, and still is, possible with the original Shield, but it's worth noting that a year of updates have significantly improved the experience. The only drawback to console mode? You can't wake it from sleep using the controller. The only option is to fiddle with that mushy power button. Blergh. Gaming over LTE Streaming games over a local network is admittedly pretty neat, but does it work over LTE? Yes, but getting it up and running isn't always easy. If your network setup is running one of NVIDIA's recommended routers and fits all the necessary requirements, GeForce Experience does most of the heavy lifting, opening the necessary ports and making it easy for the tablet to stream over LTE. Unfortunately, my home network is governed by a stubborn carrier-branded router that refused to open the necessary ports. Over the course of about a week I spent several hours trying to coax my network into playing nice with the LTE version of NVIDIA's tablet, but I never managed to overcome the router's frustratingly limited configuration menu. That doesn't mean GameStream over LTE doesn't work, of course, it just means I need to consider finding a new service provider. Eventually I was able to connect to a computer behind a less contentious network, and PC gameplay piped through as expected. Under ideal conditions, the experience mirrored local streaming -- an almost magical transportation of high-end gaming to a small screen -- but a lot of things can foul it up. Limited bandwidth on the host computer's end can ruin the experience, as can a sub-par connection to AT&T's LTE network. And yes, that \"LTE\" icon is absolutely necessary: attempting to stream over a flighty HSPA+ connection frequently resulted in stuttering gameplay with an eventual crash. Make sure you have a strong connection and a properly configured host PC, however, and it works like a dream. Using GameStream from outside of the local network requires you to leave your PC on, too -- something I'm not in the habit of doing when I'm outside my home for multiple days at a time. I also found that a crashed game was a lot harder to fix when I didn't have direct access to my home machine, and didn't stream games from my own PC all that often. I did, however, get substantial milage out of NVIDIA GRID, the company's cloud gaming platform. GRID has been available as a free beta to Shield owners for almost a year now, but it's particularly useful on the company's LTE tablet -- there's no PC set up, no pesky port-forwarding and no worries that an app-crash might leave my home machine running a high-end game unattended. All I ever needed was a strong LTE connection and the tablet itself. I used it to play Street Fighter 4 in Disneyland, and it was pretty great. The competition If you're looking at the Shield tablet for high-end Android gaming and PC streaming, you really only have one other option: the Shield portable. NVIDIA's GameStream technology is proprietary -- and although some enterprising folks in the Android community have reverse-engineered it, no other Android product on the market offers a comparable feature. It isn't a tablet, and isn't quite as powerful, but NVIDIA's original Shield can be had for $100 less than our $299 Shield tablet review unit (and you won't have to shell out an additional $60 for the Shield controller, either). If you're just looking for a solid tablet, on the other hand, then you've got choices. If the Shield's 1,920 x 1,200 IPS screen isn't good enough for you, take a look at the $400 Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 -- it has a bright 2,560 x 1,600 display and a big enough battery to keep it running for over 12 hours. Prefer iOS? Apple's iPad mini with Retina display offers a similar runtime and resolution for the same price. Google hasn't unveiled its latest Nexus tablet yet, but last year's model is a contender on its own: At $230, it offers all of the non-gaming features a potential Shield buyer could want at a significantly reduced price. If you're looking for more battery life, however, take a look at Amazon's 7-inch Kindle Fire HDX: it won't cost a dime more than the Nexus 7, but it'll last longer. Wrap-up When Engadget reviewed NVIDIA's original Shield handheld, we called it a \"truly strange device,\" albeit a fun, powerful and completely worthwhile one. The Shield tablet is everything that device was, but less odd. As a tablet, it's far more versatile than the handheld was, making its lack of Tegra-optimized (and exclusive) games easier to forgive. It's still a powerful gaming device, but it's no longer an outlier. At the end of the day, the NVIDIA Shield is a solid, worthwhile 8-inch Android tablet in its own right, and it just happens to have a host of novel features, to boot. Sadly, making the most of the device requires an extra $60 controller and an NVIDIA GTX GPU -- making the full Shield experience an expensive proposition. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: nvidia, review, shield, shieldtablet, Twitch \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20946029 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20946029\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/nvidia/shield-tablet/\"> NVIDIA Shield Tablet </a> NVIDIA Shield Tablet 16GB 32GB / LTE Buy from $299 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/nvidia/shield-tablet/\" title=\"NVIDIA Shield Tablet reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 7 </a> Prices Discussions Form factor Tablet Operating system Android Screen size 8 inches Storage type Internal storage (16 GB, Flash), Memory card Camera (integrated) 5\u00a0megapixels Announced 2014-07-22 see all specs \u2192 7.9average user rating Features 10 Display 9.1 Battery life 6 Ease of use 8.6 Storage capacity 9.1 Design and form factor 9.4 Portability (size / weight) 8.9 Durability 8.9 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 Displaying prices for model: 16GB-Black $299.00 + tax & shipping Buy now 1 Where are the Nvidia Tegra K1 Cell phones?

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/14/sharp-aquos-crystal-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "October 14th 2014 at 2:00 pm", "body": " Pop quiz, hotshot: When's the last time you saw a Sharp phone in the United States? The Sharp FX from years back? Maybe the FX Plus? If you're anything like me, your mind will hearken back to chunky clamshell classics like this one. Long story short, it's been ages since Sharp has had any kind of mobile presence around these parts. That's something the Japanese company is finally ready to change, and it's aiming to do it with a splash. Enter the AQUOS Crystal, one of the most striking phones you'll ever see. It's finally available for $149 on Boost Mobile now and Sprint will get it come October 17th, but we have questions -- so many questions. Has Sharp figured out a way to crack the all-too-fickle US market? Are we looking at a classic case of style over substance? Gallery | 23 Photos Sharp AQUOS Crystal review + See all 23 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 82 Sharp AQUOS Crystal Pros Striking bezel-less screen Decent performer Above-average battery life Can be had for a low price Cons Both cameras are mediocre Lots of bloatware Exclusive to Sprint and its MVNOs Summary The AQUOS Crystal is Sharp's first phone to land in the US in ages, and it's a looker thanks to that amazing screen design. It isn't just handsome, though: The Snapdragon 400 ticking away inside gives it enough oomph to keep up with most people's daily grinds. Alas, if you're not a fan of Sprint, you'll have to look elsewhere for your bezel-less phone fix. _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware Let's just get it out of the way now: The AQUOS Crystal looks fantastic. It's the only phone I've ever tested that prompted random bystanders to either gawk or give it a double take as they walked by. One look is enough to reveal why: Those people were ogling the 5-inch 720p screen sitting up front... and more specifically, the lack of just about anything surrounding it. Squint hard enough and you'll see just the faintest hint of a bezel running around the screen, so small that it may as well not be there. The effect is utterly striking -- it feels like you're holding some sort of J.J. Abramsian Star Trek floating-screen prop in your hand instead of a smartphone you can buy from a store right now. It isn't long before you notice why the Crystal earned its name, either. The glass covering the screen is angled at the edges to look like some sort of precious stone, an effect that's usually more obnoxious than neat since it creates a pair of distracting rainbow lines where the material angles sharply. That gemstone motif informs the rest of the phone's design, too: It's mostly hard angles and flat edges, making the gently curving back the only real concession to comfort you'll find. Still, since there's hardly any cruft taking up space around the screen, the Crystal feels surprisingly small when you're holding onto it -- in fact, the HTC One M8 and Samsung Galaxy S5 feel downright unwieldy in comparison. Since a full seven-eighths of the phone's face is nothing but screen, Sharp had to get creative when it came time to load it up with the usual accoutrements. Take the Crystal's earpiece, for instance: There isn't one. Well, not a traditional one, anyway. Rather than try and squeeze one in above the display (and ruin that lovely floating effect), Sharp included what it calls a Direct Wave Receiver that essentially turns the entire front glass panel into an earpiece. It's hardly a new concept -- Kyocera's been playing with the idea of speaker-less phones for a few years now and Google Glass has a bone-conducting transmitter -- but Sharp's solution sounds better than you might think. Meanwhile, the 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera is actually located in a silver expanse along the bottom edge of the phone's face, which some of you will know is definitely not prime placement for selfies. The rest of the Crystal is decidedly sparse: The 8-megapixel camera and LED flash sit high on the phone's rear, amid a sea of dimpled, white plastic that forms the removable battery cover. Underneath that lies the (sadly) non-removable 2,040mAh battery, with nano-SIM and microSD card slots nestled right above it. Turns out that latter addition is pretty crucial, since it will let you add up to 128GB of storage to a device that only comes with 8GB of space (only about four of which you can use right out of the gate). When it comes to the brains of the operation, don't let the premium looks fool you: We're working with a pretty modest spec list here. There's a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 thrumming away inside that plastic frame, paired with 1.5GB of RAM and a CDMA/LTE radio -- nothing terribly new, nor astonishingly snappy, but not a bad choice considering the Crystal's cheapo price tag. Display and sound It'd be pretty stupid of Sharp to use a subpar screen when it removed nearly everything that could possibly distract you from it. Thankfully, it's got the chops to make some impressive displays, and the 5-inch LCD panel it crammed into the Crystal doesn't disappoint. First, the elephant in the room: Yes, the screen only runs at 720p, and no, that's not a bad thing. It's plenty bright when you need it to be and colors are well-saturated, though whites aren't as crisp and blacks aren't as sumptuous as they are on more premium devices. Still, pictures and videos pop when there's no border restraining them -- even poking through your email feels just a little wondrous. Alas, that screen ain't perfect. My biggest niggle comes to the fore when you look at the Crystal's screen from an angle. This isn't an issue with viewing angles; your face could be perpendicular to the display and you'd still be able to make out what was going on without much trouble. No, there's actually some prominent light leakage going on at the edges of the panel. It's not so noticeable on the longer left and right edges, but there's enough light bleeding through along the screen's top side that my eyes couldn't avoid gravitating there when I was indoors (the power of the sun usually overpowers it). Distraction? You bet. Dealbreaker? Probably not. I'm not sure how widespread this issue is, or if it's even avoidable given how the screen is laid out. Still, it's a mild annoyance at worst and it's even more tolerable considering how much the phone'll set you back. Sadly, the audio side doesn't quite live up to the (pretty high) bar the screen has set. Sharp (and Sprint, I'm sure) have tried to augment the Crystal's musical chops with Harman Kardon's Clari-Fi and LiveStage audio-enhancing tech. I've taken both features for a spin in the past, and there wasn't much new to report back here. Clari-Fi once again does a fine job of livening up your audio tracks by sharpening mids and highs and enhancing vocals, but that all really comes down to the song you're listening to -- some will sound vastly improved; others will hardly change, and you probably won't notice any of those software-enhanced nuances the minute you get on the subway. And what of LiveStage? I still can't for the life of me understand why anyone would bother to turn this on. In a perfect world, the feature would add reverb just so and tweak tracks to make them sound as though they're being performed in front of you. Instead, it adds a bit of aural distance between the layers of a song and almost always makes them sound worse. Maybe my ears, battered as they are thanks to years of loud Japanese rock, just don't get it. I'd wager yours won't either, but hey -- it's not a dealbreaker. And, of course, none of those features even work without headphones plugged in, which is sort of a shame considering the single rear speaker is purely average when it comes to pumping out the jams. The speaker's wimpy muddiness is pretty much par for the course for a budget smartphone, which, while unavoidable, is still a bummer. Software I (like many of you, I suspect) am an Android purist. Shocker, right? Thankfully, Sharp hardly futzed with Google's OS before throwing it on the Crystal: It runs a pretty clean build of Android 4.4.2... that just happens to be festooned with all the extraneous Sprint apps you could think of. Upon first boot, I was greeted by a preloaded AccuWeather widget on the home screen, a Sprint featured-apps widget on another and no fewer than 20 additional apps and bolt-on services that the carrier decided I needed to have. Fortunately, most of those bright yellow Sprint icons are merely pointers to listings in the Google Play store, which means they're easy to dismiss with extreme prejudice. Not all of them are useless cruft, though: MobiSystems' Office Suite 7 contains solid document and spreadsheet apps, and NBA Game Time and NASCAR Mobile are easily accessible if you're into ballers and racers, respectively. There's also a pretty impressive Siri/Cortana analog in the form of Speaktoit's Assistant app (yeah, its branding could use a little work) that'll read you the day's top headlines, translate languages and let you check in on Foursquare in addition to the de facto slew of virtual assistant tasks. What few bits Sharp did add are centered on the screen; so-called Frameless effect settings allow you to enable visual notifications that surge across the display. Meanwhile, an additional screen lock will kick in once you initiate or pick up a call just to make sure your cheek doesn't accidentally hang up on your friends for you. Hardly the fanciest things you'll ever see, but surprisingly useful all the same. Camera Every phone maker is guilty of cutting corners with cameras at least once (especially with mid-range phones for the masses), and Sharp is no different. The main imaging attraction is an 8-megapixel rear camera that mostly churns out soft, grainy, under-saturated shots, even when there's a seemingly sufficient amount of light bathing your subjects. Take it into the great outdoors on a bright day, though, and things start to improve a bit -- you'll be able to pick out just a little more detail in your photos, but the end results are still rarely worth getting worked up over. If anything, I'm fonder of the equally lacking 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera because it's quirky and isn't where it should be. As mentioned before, it sits at the bottom of the Crystal's face -- in order to take a selfie that isn't 90 percent neck and chin(s), you've got to turn the Crystal upside-down. Honestly, it sounds like much more of a hassle than it actually is (though the repeated visual reminders of everything going on south of my face are a little disturbing). Anyway, it's good enough for a Skype video call or a group Hangout; just don't expect to snap any masterpieces with it. As usual, both cameras will record video (with resolutions maxing out at 1080p and 720p for the main and secondary shooters, respectively). Surprise, surprise: Video doesn't come out so hot either, as it's laden with grain and the lens takes a bit longer to switch focus than I'd like to see. Gallery | 11 Photos Sharp AQUOS Crystal sample shots + See all 11 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") It's actually kind of a shame the two sensors are so lackluster, because the camera UI packs in a few neat tricks to help you snap better photos. All the usual settings like HDR mode, geotagging controls, ISO and white balance are present and accounted for, but a framing guide displays patterns on the Crystal's screen so you can better line up your photos. Oh, and if you're a nerd who often takes pictures of computer screens (not that we'd know anything about that), a Flicker Control setting counteracts the annoying refresh rate that manifests as those dark bars that run down displays. You can dismiss those settings with a single touch, while another snaps a fresh new photo, though there were a few (very rare) occasions when I had to tap the screen multiple times to make the Crystal understand I wanted to take a photo. Performance and battery Life The screen will garner most of the attention, but let's not forget about how this thing runs. As I pointed out earlier, the AQUOS Crystal uses one of Qualcomm's 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400s (more specifically, the MSM8926). It's nothing if not a known quantity by now; it was first revealed over a year ago and has powered devices like Motorola's LTE-friendly version of the Moto G and LG's G2 mini LTE. Consider that a roundabout way of saying it's not too hard to guess how smoothly the Crystal operates: It's plenty snappy, but easy to stymie if you're willing to try. Rapidly scrolling through long web pages in Chrome was mostly a graceful affair, as was jumping in, out and between apps. The Crystal isn't immune to slowdown, though -- it took three seconds to launch the camera and a jam-packed notification shade would occasionally stutter when I dismissed it -- but there's enough horsepower tucked away in there to make sure it won't leave you hanging while you're trying to get things done. Oh, you're a fan of numbers? The benchmark breakdown reveals, well, nothing terribly surprising. The AQUOS Crystal and Motorola's second-generation Moto G are pretty much dead even by all counts, while HTC's Desire 816 (also available contract-free on Virgin Mobile) pulls ahead thanks to its slightly speedier version of the Snapdragon 400 chip. Sharp AQUOS Crystal Moto G (2014) HTC Desire 816 Quadrant 2.0 8,553 8,846 13,172 Vellamo 3.0 1,621 1,669 2,421 3DMark IS Unlimited 4,657 4,679 4,830 SunSpider 1.0.2 (ms) 1,569 1,534 1,137 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 1.7 N/A 1.7 CF-Bench 14,496 14,470 19,593 SunSpider: Lower scores are better; results compiled on Chrome. Now, regarding that 2,040mAh battery. In the standard Engadget rundown test (with the phone connected to WiFi and looping a 720p video while fetching social updates at 50 percent screen brightness), the AQUOS Crystal stuck around for a full eight hours and 46 minutes before it needed to suckle on a power outlet once more. Curiously, that's just over an hour more than what the 2014 Moto G eked out of its battery (which is actually just a touch more capacious) when we ran it through the wringer earlier this month. Real-world testing saw some similarly strong results -- my days of tweeting, taking calls, watching Sutton Foster videos on YouTube, triaging emails and playing games on the toilet were never enough to kill the Crystal before work hours were over. On average, it took just north of 15 hours to discharge the thing completely, which means enough juice for your routine and then some. Here's another question to ponder: How well does this thing actually work as a phone? It lacks a traditional earpiece! How crazy! In fact, the whole telephonic shebang works reasonably well -- while call quality is best when you hold your ear to the top of the phone, you can actually stick it anywhere on the screen and converse the way you always do. Why anyone would choose to plop those ears smack-dab in the center of the screen to listen is beyond me, but hey: At least you've got the option. Alas, it's never quite as loud as a standard speaker, and people I called weren't terribly enthused with the somewhat quiet output they got as I spoke into the microphone. The competition Here's the thing to remember about the AQUOS Crystal: It's only going to be an option for you if you're OK inking a deal with Sprint (or shacking up with sub-brands like Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile). Everyone else can just move along right now... unless you live in Japan, in which case I'd recommend you live a little and splurge on the Crystal's more powerful big brother. After all, the Crystal X pairs a bigger 5.5-inch frameless display with a 2.3GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 for added oomph. That snappy combination of style and power is a distinct step up from the version we have here in the States, and I'm frankly a little bummed that's not the model I'm reviewing today. Anyway, let's break the rest down by carrier. On Sprint, the Crystal costs $240 upfront to own it free and clear, which you could also split into monthly payments that get tacked onto your bill. You could feasibly consider the LG G3 Vigor (with monthly payments of $13 over 24 months), though we're looking at a dead heat between spec sheets and I'd give the Crystal the nod if only because of style. And don't forget the original HTC One. It's a bit long in the tooth, but it's got a lovely 1080p display and enough horsepower to run a circle or two around the Crystal. If you're jonesing for some non-contract action on Virgin Mobile (where the Crystal only costs $150), you'll have to decide whether you'd rather spend the extra cash on a HTC Desire 816. It's bigger, and it packs a better camera and speakers, and a Snapdragon processor clocked at 1.6GHz. The downside? It costs twice as much as the Crystal. Did your wallet just groan as you read that? You could also consider the HTC Desire (actually a rebranded Desire 601), but you probably shouldn't -- you'd spend $30 more for a lousier camera and a lower-resolution screen. The Crystal costs the same $150 on Boost Mobile, where there are plenty of (less stylish) choices. There's yet another HTC Desire in the form of the 510 that only costs $100, and while it doesn't quite stack up to the Crystal, it's cheap and it comes close. Oh, and in the event you're not exactly married to Sprint's ilk and want a similarly spec'd phone without spending a ton of money, consider the original Moto G with LTE. Sure, it doesn't have the big screen or improved camera that its sequel does, but $219 will score you a device with the same brains as the Crystal and the LTE support none of the next-gen Moto phones have yet. Wrap-up Sharp and Sprint deserve some major kudos -- not only did they bring a truly interesting smartphone to our shores, but also they're pricing it to move and trying to get it into as many hands as possible. I can't help but wish Sprint imported the Crystal's more powerful brother instead, but hey: We have an actual bezel-less screen, and a set of guts that (for the most part) doesn't let it down. In the end, though, here's what it boils down to: If you're absolutely, positively enamored with Sprint, and don't feel the need to pay gobs of money for top-tier power, the AQUOS Crystal is definitely worth your attention. If you're all about the non-contract lifestyle on Virgin or Boost, though, the Crystal is a steal at $150. Thanks to the dark magic of carrier-exclusivity deals, no one else need apply. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: aquos, aquoscrystal, mobilepostcross, review, sharp \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20975896 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20975896\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/sharp/aquos/crystal/\"> Sharp AQUOS Crystal </a> Sharp AQUOS Crystal Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/sharp/aquos/crystal/\" title=\"Sharp AQUOS Crystal reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 2 </a> Prices Discussions Type Smartphone Operating system Android (KitKat [4.4]) Screen size 5 inches Internal memory 8 GB Camera 8\u00a0megapixels Carriers (US) Sprint-Nextel, Other Dimensions 5.16 x 2.64 x 0.39 in Released 2014-10-10 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Reception and call quality 8 Display 10 Battery life 8 Camera 9 Ease of use 10 Design and form factor 10 Portability (size / weight) 9 Media support 9 Durability 9 Ecosystem (apps, accessories, etc.) 8 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 No one has started a discussion about this product yet.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/14/basis-peak-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "November 14th 2014 at 5:00 pm", "body": " Jawbone. Fitbit. Microsoft. And now... Basis. If you don't know much about the brand, you really should get up to speed: The company quietly put out one of the best fitness trackers, and now it's a part of Intel. Which means, it's officially one of the big names in health gadgets. Like the previous-generation B1 band, the new Basis Peak can automatically detect when you're exercising or asleep, making it one of the most automated fitness trackers around. This time, though, it brings a sharper design, a redesigned app and an improved sensor that can track your heart rate when you're working out, as opposed to when you're just sitting still. What's more, it will eventually be able to display smartwatch-like notifications on its 1.25-inch touchscreen, at which point it'll be way more versatile than your typical fitness band. Like before, the Peak costs $200, meaning it's still one of the more expensive fitness trackers on the market. As you'll see, though, I'm not sure that's a dealbreaker.

Still, you'll get more value for your money once Basis adds smartphone notifications, which will turn this fitness band into more of a smartwatch.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware This is where every review takes a subjective turn. Personally, I think the Peak is a good-looking piece of kit. That said, as I was testing it, several of my Engadget coworkers made offhand remarks about how ugly the thing is. It all depends on your taste, I suppose. That, and how you classify the product to begin with. As a fitness tracker, the Peak is a big, clunky thing. It calls way too much attention to itself. Which is to say, it looks more like a smartwatch, what with its 1.25-inch screen and 23mm wristband. And as a smartwatch, well, it ain't bad. Its black-and-gray monochrome display is actually dainty compared to some of the big-screen models we've seen, like the LG G Watch R, Moto 360 and Samsung Gear S. As a woman with a bony wrist, I worry the Peak might be a little too much for me. It doesn't go with all my outfits either, which doesn't help. Still, as far as smartwatches go, this is one of the more discreet options. And hey, if you're a guy with thicker bone structure and a more masculine wardrobe, well, none of this might even apply to you. I'm willing to bet a dude in a button-down looks better in this watch than I do in a blouse and skirt. Regardless of what you think of the design, though, I think we can agree on this: It's a clear improvement over Basis' last-generation fitness band, the B1. First off, the metal body is thinner, so the whole thing just looks a bit sleeker. Also, that touchscreen is actually new. Without that in the last model, you instead had to tap these small screw-like pins stuck in the four corners of the display. It was unsightly, and also made the watch kind of tedious to use. The touchscreen here is much sleeker, and also easier to operate. Then there's the band. Whereas it used to be made of hard plastic, it's now fashioned out of soft silicone, available in black and white. On the black model in particular, the weave pattern could be mistaken for matte-finish metal from afar -- kind of like on the Pebble Steel. (On the white model that I tested? Not so much.) Anyway, if you're not as enamored with the band as I am (it's comfy, guys!) you can replace it with any standard 23mm band of your choosing. On the underbelly of the watch face you'll find a new optical heart rate sensor, which glows green when in use (much more on this later). There's also a set of charging pins that allow it to fit inside the proprietary charging cradle. Speaking of the sort, the Peak is rated for four days of battery life, which seems about right to me -- I only ended up charging it twice a week or so. Not great for a fitness tracker, but excellent for a smartwatch, which this essentially is -- or will be. Under the hood, there's now a Bluetooth LE radio, similar to what you'll find in basically every other new smartwatch and fitness band. Also like some other devices, the Peak is water-resistant in up to 50 meters of pressure -- a rating known as \"5 ATM.\" So, you can safely swim and shower with it, but you'll want to be careful about surfing or any other water sport where wipeouts are possible. Of course, too, that's with the standard silicone band -- it holds up well after being submerged in water. If you swap in your own 23mm wristband, though, your mileage is going to vary. Getting started Like other fitness bands we've tested recently, the Peak is only compatible with a handful of devices, though it's worth noting that the selection here is especially small. As of this writing, Basis officially supports just five Android phones: the Nexus 5, HTC One M8 and the Samsung Galaxy S4, S5 and Note 3. Compare that with Garmin, whose new Vivosmart band works with 10 different Android phones. It's a frustrating situation either way, but more is definitely better here. Unofficially, the Peak should work with any Android phone running Android 4.4.2 or higher, with a screen between three and six inches. That's all theoretical, though: In my tests, the Peak would only pair with devices on the official support list. Anyhow, Basis says it will add support for more handsets over time. And if you own a reasonably new iPhone, you're already set: The Peak is compatible with the 4s and up, as well as the fifth-gen iPod touch. Assuming you're in possession of an officially supported phone, the setup process is quick and easy. Just install the iOS or Android app, and either create a new account or sign in with your existing one. Then plug the watch into your computer's USB port using the proprietary cradle, and hit the pair button from inside the app. At that point, the two devices should start talking to each other, and the setup process should just complete itself; at no point do you have to put the watch into pairing mode, or anything like that. And there you have it. Now you're ready to put on the watch and get moving. In use What's always made Basis bands special is how little work they entail. Thanks to an arsenal of different sensors, the watch knows when you're exercising and when you've gone to sleep; you never have to enter a specific mode in order for it to work properly. But even though these features aren't new on the Peak, I still think they're worth celebrating. When I started a workout on the elliptical machine, the watch took just four seconds to catch on. And when I look at my sleep report in the morning, my supposed bedtime always matches up closely with the time I saw on the clock right before closing my eyes. Basis' bands aren't the prettiest, but they're the only fitness trackers I've been able to wear with any consistency. That's because the hardware isn't asking me to do very much, other than wear it. \"So why not just buy the original B1 band on sale?\" you're asking now. \"It has all the same core features, doesn't it?\" In fact, the Peak is indeed a little smarter than its predecessor. Whereas the original could only detect your heart rate if you were sitting still, or engaged in light activity, like walking, the new model can track your heart rate even if you're in the middle of a rigorous workout. Though this might seem like a no-brainer feature, it actually took a fair amount of R&D before Basis could figure it out. The problem is that the original B1 used an optical heart rate sensor that produced a lot of signal noise during workouts. Meanwhile, an electrical sensor like the kind used in chest straps would have meant chunkier hardware and shorter battery life. At last, though, the company landed on a new optical sensor, one it says is more accurate. I'd say it works as advertised. During an elliptical workout, I periodically checked my heart rate using both the Peak and the elliptical's built-in sensor, and every time the readouts were either identical or very similar -- there was never more than a three-point difference. All told, the heart rate sensor captures your heart rate up to 32 times per second, according to a company spokesperson, which helps explain why my readings were so accurate, especially during steady-state workouts where my pace didn't fluctuate much. Keep in mind, though, that if you're doing an activity where your heart rate increases or decreases rapidly, it could take the watch up to 10 seconds for the device to calculate your heart rate. The reason for that lag: the same algorithm that's designed to cut down on signal noise. It means the watch sometimes needs a few extra seconds to think. Even then, you're not likely to notice. Basis says that in the event of a lag, the readout will be delayed; you won't see the reading drop out, and the watch won't hang on the last-known number either. Basically, then, you'd also have to be wearing another heart rate tracker to know for sure whether the heart rate reading was in real time or it was slightly delayed. And if it was a few seconds off, would you even care? I don't think I would. To those of you who still think the Peak is but a modest upgrade over the original B1, I'd also encourage you to consider the touchscreen. Not only does the watch look more streamlined without any pins around the display, but it's also significantly easier to use. All I have to do is swipe from left to right to see my settings, heart rate and step count. Because the watch lacks a GPS radio, it doesn't track distance, which is a bummer. Basis has said that it left out that part to conserve battery life, and that it assumes people will be using a smartphone for sports apps anyway. That may be true for some people, but not all of us like to work out with a phone on our person. Personally, too, if I'm going to go out of my way to wear a fitness tracker, I'd like for it to display as many of these \"high-level\" stats as possible. Calories and steps taken are a good start, but I'd expect to know my daily mileage too. At any time, I can swipe up on the watch face to see my daily activity totals. Really, it's not that different from an Android Wear watch, where you're mostly swiping left and right, or up and down. That's important because the Peak will one day be a smartwatch in its own right: At some point before 2014 is up, Basis will push out a software update that brings notifications for things like voice calls. When the time comes, users will want to sift through that information quickly and easily. The UI here creates a good blueprint for that. App Really, except for when I take the watch off to charge it or swipe the touchscreen to peek at my step count, I barely interact with the hardware itself. I just leave it on my wrist, and am sometimes able to forget it's even there. If anything, I've been spending more of my time in the app. And what a nice app it is. To be clear, this is a totally separate application from what the older B1 used, with a slicker design and more intuitive UI. This time around, you can see more information on the main home screen, including your heart rate, step count and calorie burn, along with an activity feed showing things like recent workouts and last night's sleep stats (deep sleep vs. REM sleep, for example). Everything is color-coded, so I know at a glance if I've met my goals (green) or if they're in progress (yellow). Anything heart-related appears in red, which also makes sense. Of course, you can also drill down and get even more detail. With sleep, for example, you can see how much deep, REM and light sleep you got, how many \"interruptions\" you had and how many times you tossed and turned. When it comes to things like deep sleep, you can see both what percentage of your sleep that included, as well as how much time you spent in each of these sleep stages. What to do with all this information? There's a chart breaking all this down, along with an overall sleep score (34 percent, for example, if you only get 2.5 hours of REM sleep and two hours of deep sleep). Even so, I could use some more insight into what these stats actually mean. Basis could do a better job of not only explaining that, but also offering me personalized advice on what I could be doing better. Gallery | 15 Photos Basis Peak screenshots + See all 15 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") As before, too, Basis lets you sign up for challenges -- or \"habits,\" to use the company's word. Personally, I signed up for \"Move it\" (be active for 30 minutes, three days a week) and \"Morning Lap\" (take 2,000 steps before noon). Oh, and I also signed up for \"Wear it,\" where I get credit just for using the thing. (I never did say I was an overachiever.) There are also options for \"Evening lap,\" having a regular bedtime and wake time, getting up to walk around every hour, and so on. I think you get the idea. From the home screen, I can see my habits and which ones I've fulfilled -- you can tell you're doing a good job because they start to glow green as you tick off your various goals. There's also a dedicated \"habits\" page within the app where I can get more information -- say, how long I \"wore it\" each day, or how much active time I banked each day to win the \"Move it\" challenge. In the beginning, you can only sign up for three habits, but over time, as you consistently practice good habits, you earn the right to add more. Between that and the encouraging green color-coding, I feel like I'm being rewarded for good behavior, and I feel motivated to keep up my winning streak. The competition Basis has lots of competition, both among fitness bands and smartwatches. That said, for all the options we have right now, no one seems to be getting this fitness-tracking thing exactly right. Because the Peak can automatically detect when you're working out or have gone to sleep, it's more technologically advanced than most other fitness trackers, including the Fitbit Charge ($130), Microsoft Band ($200), Garmin Vivosmart ($170) and the Jawbone Up24 ($130). (In fairness: The forthcoming Up3 will have workout detection, but it's not out yet. The Microsoft Band will eventually get sleep detection too, through a future software update.) The Peak is also more sophisticated than your typical smartwatch -- most of them can't even deliver an accurate heart rate reading, much less tell when you're exercising or sleeping. And remember that the Peak will soon deliver notifications too, just like a smartwatch. I would caution, however, that it's still not as sleek as a standalone fitness band, or even some smartwatches, like the Moto 360. And again, while the app is a big improvement over the old one, I've seen software from other companies that's even more polished, both in terms of UI as well as their ability to motivate users to live a healthier life. Jawbone, in particular, places a big emphasis on delivering insights into how the body works -- reminding you, for instance, that you crave more carbs when you're sleep deprived. Microsoft, meanwhile, seems to have a winner with Microsoft Health, even if its inaugural Band feels unfinished from a hardware standpoint. All that said, the Peak's few shortcomings are outweighed by its strengths. It's not perfect, but it stands as one of the best fitness trackers you can buy. Maybe one day it will also be one of the best smartwatches. But hey, first things first. Wrap-up Despite its relatively high price (and a few imperfections), the Basis Peak is still one of the best fitness trackers you can buy right now. That's mostly because of how automated it is, with the ability to track your sleep and workouts without you having to enter any sort of special mode. A few other fitness trackers can do that for exercise or sleep, but usually not both. It's also on the cusp of receiving a software update that will make it behave more like a smartwatch, with notifications for things like texts. And guess what? When that time comes, the Peak is likely to have longer battery life than just about any other smartwatch we've tested so far. Again, though, there are some trade-offs. While the app has seen huge improvements, it still doesn't offer as many insights as, say, Jawbone's. It doesn't track distance, which feels like a silly omission. The device is bigger than competing fitness trackers, but that'll matter less once the Peak gets those smartphone notifications -- if it acts like a smartwatch, then it's OK if it looks like one too. On that note, it probably makes sense to hold off on buying the Peak until that software update comes through; without it, you're not using the device to its full potential. Also, as you can imagine, we'd rather see if the notifications work as advertised. In any case, though, if you insist on buying a fitness tracker now, the Peak is indeed a good choice. A pricey choice, but a good choice nonetheless. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: basis, basis peak, basispeak, intel, peak, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20990550 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20990550\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/basis/peak/\"> Basis Peak </a> Basis Peak Buy from $193 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/basis/peak/\" title=\"Basis Peak reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Type Watch-style Tracking metrics Motion / steps, Heart rate, Calories, Sleep Display Yes Battery life Up to 4 days Announced 2014-09-30 see all specs \u2192 9average user rating Durability 10 Portability 10 Ease of use 10 Design and form factor 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $193.90 + tax & shipping Buy now 1 How much in Australia.

{"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/13/asus-c200-chromebook-review/", "sitename": "Engadget", "datetime": "August 13th 2014 at 11:00 am", "body": " Sorry, naysayers: You're going to see a fair number of Chromebook reviews from us over the next few months. That's mostly because sales of these inexpensive laptops have shot up -- which means everyone and their mother is now making one, even companies that had previously shied away. The latest brand to join the fray is ASUS, which already has loads of experience building small, cheap notebooks. Indeed, ASUS' 11-inch C200 Chromebook ($250) looks like a 2009-era EeePC brought back to life: The spacious keyboard feels eerily familiar, as does the long, 11-hour battery life. Even so, it's not a perfect machine by any means -- in fact, it has a pretty serious flaw -- but if you're in the market for a Chromebook, it couldn't hurt to consider a company that seems to know what it's doing. Gallery | 23 Photos ASUS C200 Chromebook review + See all 23 _when_.eng(\"eng.galleries.init\") 74 ASUS C200 Chromebook Pros Very long battery life Comfortable keyboard and trackpad Lightweight Cons Sluggish performance Poor viewing angles Summary The C200 Chromebook offers best-in-class battery life and a comfortable keyboard, but is held back by sluggish performance. For the same price or even less, you can find a Chromebook that runs more smoothly.\u00a0 _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.engReviews\") Hardware I know you're tired of hearing Chromebooks compared to netbooks and, look, so am I. But hear me out: The reason some of you have even heard of ASUS in the first place is because it pioneered the mini-PC fad. By now, it probably knows a thing or two about making super-small, super-low-priced machines, right? Right. Mostly. The C200 is made of plastic, as you'd expect on a sub-$300 system, and indeed, it's pretty unremarkable-looking. But, to ASUS' credit, the build generally feels more solid than, say, Acer's C720, which flexed when you grabbed it by the palm rest. There's less bend here, though the screen wobbles when you set the laptop down on a table. It's also fairly compact: At 0.8 inch thick, it has similar dimensions as the Acer C720, except it weighs just 2.5 pounds, versus 2.76 for the C720. Although both are perfectly easy to tote around, the C200 is noticeably lighter. It's on the keyboard that ASUS' netbook expertise really shines through. The buttons here manage to be cushier than on most other Chromebooks, though the Dell Chromebook 11 and Toshiba Chromebook both rank pretty highly in that regard. Not only that, but also the keys are well-spaced, and none of the major buttons (Enter, Shift, etc.) have been shrunken down to fit the 12-inch-wide frame. The trackpad, meanwhile, is spacious compared to the one on the Acer C720, and does a precise job with single-finger tracking. No complaints there. I wish I could say such nice things about the display, but this is one of the main areas where Chromebook makers cut corners. As on rival systems, the C200 rocks an 11.6-inch, 1,366 x 768 panel (non-touch), and as usual, the viewing angles are awful. Dip the lid forward even slightly and the screen washes out to the point of being unreadable. Unfortunately, even if you were to invest in a more expensive machine, the display quality would still be fairly crappy. Take the Samsung Chromebook 2, for instance: Even with a sharper, full HD screen, it still suffers from narrow viewing angles. The C200 also offers the same exact port selection as other Chromebooks. This includes two USB connections (one of them 3.0), a full-sized HDMI socket, an SD card reader, a headphone jack and a lock slot.

What a difference a processor makes. The C200 is one of the few Chromebooks that doesn't use a dual-core Haswell chip, the Intel Celeron 2955U. Instead, it packs the dual-core Celeron N2830, part of Intel's Bay Trail family. Given the common \"Celeron\" brand and the fact that the C200 is in the same price range as its competitors, you might assume the performance would be similar. In fact, though, the C200 is quite a bit slower than other models I've tested. The machine takes 12 seconds to cold-boot, for instance, compared with six or seven seconds for every other Celeron-based machine. And whereas most Chromebooks sign out in four seconds (this is a necessary step for switching to Guest Mode), the C200 takes six. That sluggishness is borne out in the benchmarks as well, with the C200 coming in dead last in every test, sometimes by a wide margin. In everyday use, too, the C200 feels a bit poky, though that didn't stop me from using it as my main machine, juggling email, HipChat, Facebook, Twitter and various blogs that I read. In the end, there wasn't one big issue dragging down the performance -- I never saw websites or games slow to a crawl, and I thankfully never suffered an outright crash. No, it was the little things. Deleting emails in Gmail sometimes took longer than it should have. Ditto for loading webpages, or comments at the bottom of news articles. I even noticed a slight delay whenever I hit the \"View new Tweets\" button on Twitter's website. Sometimes, I would click a link to open something in a new tab, and then when I moved over to that tab, the machine would pause briefly. Most telling of all, I didn't have any of these issues when I switched to a more powerful laptop connected to the same WiFi network. Battery life ASUS C200 11:19 Dell Chromebook 11 8:37 Samsung Chromebook 2 (13-inch) 8:22 Toshiba Chromebook 8:15 Acer C720 Chromebook (Intel Core i3) 7:53 Acer C720 Chromebook (Intel Celeron) 7:49 Samsung Chromebook (2012) 6:33 HP Chromebook 11 5:08 Chromebook Pixel 4:08 (WiFi)/3:34 (LTE) HP Pavilion 14 Chromebook 3:35 Samsung Chromebook Series 5 550 3:23 Acer C7 Chromebook 3:16 Don't worry, though, ASUS redeems itself somewhat with amazing battery life. In a field where almost every Celeron-powered Chromebook gets the same runtime (around eight hours), the C200 is a stand-out. All told, our review unit lasted through 11 hours and 19 minutes of continuous video playback, making it the longest-lasting Chrome OS machine we've seen yet. Now, does the best-in-class battery life make up for the worst-in-class performance? Not quite, if you ask me, but hey, it's your shopping decision to make, not mine. Software Obviously, you'll get the same Chrome OS experience regardless of which model you get, so that shouldn't factor into your decision about whether to buy one Chromebook over another. But if you're unsure if Chrome OS is a good idea in the first place, you might be wondering how much you can do with such a machine, and whether it'll be enough to replace a \"real\" OS. As ever, it depends on what you need out of your computer. Since the first Chromebooks came out three years ago, Gmail and Google Drive are both usable offline, without an internet connection. The same is true of many third-party apps offered in the Chrome Web Store. Recently, too, Google started allowing folks to watch Google Play movies and TV shows offline, so you definitely don't need an internet connection quite as desperately as you did when Chromebooks first came on the scene. Like every other Chromebook, the C200 comes with 100GB of Google Drive space, free for two years, which should partially take the sting out of having just 16GB of built-in local storage. As for navigating the OS itself, having a desktop and windows you can close and resize continues to make Chrome OS feel like a more traditional operating system. The OS has also benefitted recently from other features that might seem like no-brainers -- things like pinch-to-zoom, a more sophisticated file-management system and the ability to upload Google+ photos in the background. Configuration options and the competition What you see is what you get: The C200 goes for $250 (often less) and comes with the same specs as the unit I tested here, including a dual-core Intel Celeron N2830 processor, 2GB of RAM, a 1,366 x 768 display and 16GB of built-in storage. There's also a 13-inch version, the C300, which features the same price and carries the same specs, with the exception of screen size and battery life (runtime is rated at up to 11 hours on the C200, and up to 10 hours on the C300). As for competition, the C200 has plenty. If I had published this review last week, I would have compared this mainly to other Celeron-based models, like the Dell Chromebook 11, Acer C720 Chromebook and Toshiba Chromebook. There's also the 11-inch Samsung Chromebook 2, which falls into the same category, but happens to run a Samsung-made mobile chip. In any case, had I published this review last week, I would have reminded you that the performance here is just about the worst in its class, though the battery life is the best. The keyboard is nice, and the display, while poor, is at least on par with the competition. In other words, I would've told you it's worth a look, though it's hardly a slam dunk. The problem is, even as I sat down to write this review, Acer announced the Chromebook 13, the first Chrome OS device to make use of NVIDIA's Tegra K1 chip. I haven't tested it yet, so I can't vouch for the performance or say how it compares to the C200. If nothing else, though, the Chromebook 13 should excel at graphics-intensive tasks -- things like browser gaming, movie streaming and interactive web apps. Meanwhile, the battery life is said to be as good as, if not better than, the C200: 13 hours if you get it with the 1,366 x 768 resolution screen, and 11 if you go with the full HD model. That's another thing: The regular ol' HD version starts at $279, just 30 bucks more than the C200, while the 1080p edition is priced at $299. If the Acer Chromebook 13 really performs as promised, with long battery life and impressive graphics muscle, then it's priced uncomfortably close to the C200. Unless you're hankering for an 11-inch machine (or can't spare the extra $30), the Chromebook 13 is shaping up to be a smarter buy. Even then, the Acer C720 can be had for a lower price (around $199) and the performance is guaranteed to be better. And besides, NVIDIA has made it clear there are other Tegra K1 Chromebooks in the works. Surely, an 11-inch one is on the way, right? Wrap-up The C200 has a few important things going for it: Its battery life is easily best in class, and the spacious, cushy keyboard makes it one of the better Chromebooks for typing. Still, its performance is actually worst in class, which is saying a lot considering its rivals aren't exactly powerhouses themselves. Even today, there are Chromebooks on the market offering smoother performance for a similar price, while Acer's forthcoming Chromebook 13 promises improved graphics muscle and equally long battery life for only $30 more. ASUS would do well to upgrade the C200's processor, and maybe drop the price to better compete against other brands. Until that happens, this is a fine option, but not the best. onBreak({ 0: function(){ adSetInView('1'); htmlAdWH(\"348-14-15-35bc\", 320, 115, 'text', 'instream'); adSetInView('0'); }, 768: function(){} }); Tags: asus, asus c200, asusc200, c200, chrome os, chromebook, chromebooks, chromeos, review, uk-reviews \u00a0Hide Comments 0Comments _when_.eng(\"eng.livefyre.init\", { articleId: 20944103 , domain: \"engadget.fyre.co\" , siteId: \"296092\" , el: \"livefyre_20944103\", initialNumVisible: 2 }) _when_.eng(\"eng.perm.init\"); <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/asus/chromebook/c200/\"> ASUS Chromebook C200 </a> ASUS Chromebook C200 Buy from $179 Key specs <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/asus/chromebook/c200/\" title=\"ASUS Chromebook C200 reviews\" target=\"_blank\"> Reviews \u2022 1 </a> Prices Discussions Type Ultraportable Screen size 11.6 inches Processor speed 2.1 GHz System RAM 2 GB Maximum battery life Up to 11 hours Dimensions 7.9 x 12 x 0.8 in Weight 2.5 lb Announced 2014-06-03 see all specs \u2192 8average user rating Speed and features 8 Design and form factor 8 Battery life 10 Display 8 Durability 8 Expandability 8 Noise 10 Portability (size / weight) 10 Get better reviews from people who actually have this product! write a reviewsee all reviews \u2192 $179.99 + tax & shipping Buy now 35 Can a Chromebook replace your everyday laptop?
