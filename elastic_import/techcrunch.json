[{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/10/what-its-like-to-try-out-the-apple-watch-in-store/", "sitename": "Techcrunch", "datetime": "2015-04-10 06:42:57", "body": "Apple began offering previews of the Apple Watch at its stores this morning, and we had a chance to show up early and get a run-through of the demo processbefore doors opened to customers looking to make an appointment.As expected, Apples changed up the layout of its Store to accommodate the Watch. In the Palo Alto store, theyve brought in a long table containing all 38 models available to order under a pane of glass. When its time for your appointment, an Apple representative walks you over to a designated fitting table covered with blue leather mats (made from the same material as Apples iPhone cases).Yes, the Apple Store rep will help you try on the watch. No, it isnt really awkward.After walking over to a table away from the crowd of reporters, an Apple retail employee went to the back to grab a tray holding (and charging) a variety of models,and after comparing the 38 and 42 mm sizes I decided the latter was more appropriate for my wrist. I got to try out several different types of bands: a fluoroelastomer sport band, the Milanese loop, and the $449 Link Bracelet (though it wasnt adjusted, so it hung rather loosely on my wrist). For my pre-order, I dont need anything more than the sport band (which is surprisingly comfy compared to the rubber bands that come with most fitness trackers, if a bit tricky to put on the first time), but eventually I could see myself occasionally accessorizing with one of the more premium bands.The Sport model is light, so itll be comfortable to wear while you work out. With that said,Im a bit anxious about scratching up my Watchs face, so I decided to at least give the steel Watch a chance. Its a bit heavier than the Sport, but the sapphire display should stand up to use by those of us who cant help but give our gadgets the occasional scuff. If you do go for the Sport model, you can still swap the bands for those sold for the steel Watch, so unless the contrasting metals somehow offend your taste, you shouldnt worry about not being able to dress that up, too.Apple Watch with the leather loop band. You dont get to try Watch OS on the units they use for fitting demos.Unfortunately, the models they bring out for fitting are running a video loop, not a Watch OS demo. There are demo units in the store, but those are bolted into displays that stay on the tables  you dont get a sense of the Taptic vibration for notifications or what its like to check the Watch by raising your arm to turn the screen on for six seconds.Still, you do get to try out most of the Watchs interface. Instead of showing the apps when you first turn on the display, the watch face is the home screen  its where you can swipe down to see notifications and swipe up to see the Glances, which show bits of info from your installed apps, your reserve battery, as well as a a Control Center-like widget for toggling Wi-Fi or Do Not Disturb.To access the actual apps installed on the in-store Watch, you either push in the Digital Crown or tap on a corresponding Glance. Apple didnt pre-install any third-party apps for its display unit, and instead of pairing the device with an iPhone, the iPad-like display to the side of each demo unit gives a description of what youre doing, which gives you the freedom to check things out without worrying about getting lost in the interface.The most intriguing part of the demo experience is messaging. Each demo unit comes loaded with messages and emails to respond to or dismiss, and you have your pick of response types: pre-baked messages for quickly responding to a text, a short audio clip, a transcribed message (which worked very well in the loud-and-crowded store), and fun emojis which animate as you rotate the crown. Each option will be preferable in different contexts, and Apple made them equally easy to use quickly. To initiate a conversation, you dont even need to go from the watch face to the app screen  you can just tap the button next to the digital crown to go to a screen with shortcuts to your VIP contacts.I also look forward to controlling music and podcasts from my wrist. The default music app ties into your iTunes library and gives you big buttons for pausing and skipping around as well as the option to use the crown to adjust volume. I generally dont wear headphones with integrated controls, so reaching for my wrist to make quick volume adjustments (or skip the ads in podcasts) seems like itll be a huge convenience compared to getting my phone out of my pocket and unlocking it, even with Touch ID.My biggest concern upon first use is that the touch-targets in the top left corner are a bit tiny, and in some apps the text isnt actually a button you can press. Its one of those things that could frustrate a lot of people, but just as the Home button offers an escape hatch on your iPhone, Watch owners can push in the crown at any time to get back to more familiar territory.If youre still on the fence about picking up an Apple Watch,Id recommend scheduling a quick visit to the Apple Store. Photos of the Watch on other peoples wrists simply dont give an accurate idea of what its like to have it on. That goes for software too  the Watch OS offers new modes of interaction that you should try before committing to living with.", "title": "What Its Like To Try Out The Apple WatchIn-Store"},

The remote redesign will include a touch pad, according to the , which wouldallow people to scroll and navigate.Apple declined to comment on the report when contacted by TechCrunch, but the design alteration could make a lot of sense, given Apples general input trends, the reports of whats coming for the next version of the Apple TV, and some of the companys most recent developments in the area of touch-based tech.First, a touch pad could help with more advanced navigation requirements if Apple is indeed revamping the Apple TV with a full-fledged App Store and developer SDK. It could help both with UI navigation, and with working within apps, especially if we see a greater range of app types available on the streaming box  games, for instance.Another reason it seems likely is that Apples touch-based input tech probably leads the industry, and it seems very eager to include it in its full range of input devices. Touch input is used in both the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad, and in both cases it unlocks a number of different command and control options that arent necessarily available to equivalent devices from competitors.Finally, this brings up the interesting possibility that Apple could make use of some of its newer tech in a remote redesign, specifically Force Touch and/or taptic feedback. These appear to be rolling out to new products as quickly as Apple is able to do so, with both appearing on the recent 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro, as well as the MacBook and the Apple Watch. Using Force Touch on a TV remote could open up even more input flexibility, which might also be useful given the Times additional assertion that the forthcoming remote redesign will only have two physical buttons besides the touch pad.Apples remote is also long due for a refresh; the current aluminum-bodied devicewas basically just a re-skin of the older, white plastic version, and a lot has changed in terms of Apples tech and its overall sensibilities with respect to UX over the past few years.We should findout more June 8, when the WWDC keynote kicks off Apples developer event.", "title": "The Next Apple TV Could Get A Touch-Friendly RemoteRedesign"},

Apparently, this is actually , but most consumers just wait until their bristles wear out, or it randomly occurs to them as theyre walking through the dental care aisle at their local store.A startup called , showcasing its service here today at TechCrunch Disrupt NYs Startup Alley, believes it has a better way: a new brushes as a subscription service, shipped to you automatically every three months.The company now has some investor buy-in as well, as its raised additional seed fundingafter being live for just a few months. Since its launch in February, it has grownits subscription business to several thousand customers.At first, it sounds sort of crazy. After all, how lazy are people that they need toothbrushes, of all things, on a subscription basis? But if you think back to when you actually last replaced your toothbrush, and then think about all the other, that floats around in yourbathroom where your toothbrushis kept, you might convinceyourselfthat you need a littlereminder to swap out yourold brush for a new one.The startup was founded by Simon Enever, an industrial designer previously at fuseproject, and product designer Bill May. Enever explains that having worked with dental care clients in the past, he found that manyof the innovations surrounding toothbrush bristles and toothpaste are simply gimmicks. What dentists really need people to do is to brush often, floss and, of course, swap out their brushes on a regular basis.At Quip, you initially purchase either a plastic brush base for $25 or a metal base for $40, each of which comes with your first three months of toothpaste and your first toothbrush head. Both brushes also vibrate, allowing you to clean your teeth more effectively. (Most people brush too hard, as it turns out. The vibration encourages them to brush with the right amount of pressure.)The brushes themselves are custom-designed and assembled in the U.S. The metals are also sourced in the U.S., while the plastics are from China.When it comes time to replace your toothbrush, you pull out the head and toss it. Every three months you get a pack with anew head, a 4.7-ounce tube of toothpaste and a travel toothpaste. After buying the base unit, the subscription cost is only $5 every three months  which frankly is more than reasonable when compared tothe cost of buying new in the store.Meanwhile, the company itself is doing fairly well even at this low price point  its margins are above 50 percent.Quip has experimentedwith selling the brushes directly, without requiring customers to agree torecurring billing. However, they found that the majority of those (98 percent) who visited Quip converted to subscribers.Quip raised $300,000 in 2014 from and New York area angels. Now the startup is in the process of raising an additional, largerseed round of $500,000+ with prior angels and other investors. (Quip has soft commitments of $500K+, and $125K has closed).One challenge for Quip is in educating the market that changing their toothbrush more often is something that they should bedoing, and that a set-it-and-forget option like this even exists. But getting real-world dentists on board as partners could help Quip get in front of customers. This is something the team is focusing on, says Enever.New York-based Quip is currently endorsed by an NYU dentist, and is planning to announce some dentist partnerships in the near future. Theyre also in discussions with a dental firm thatmay become investors.Also today, Quip is launching its referral program, which is aimed athelping thecompany generate more word-of-mouth (ha!) referrals. Friends who recommend others to join will receive their next toothbrush head for free.", "title": "Quips Subscription-Based Toothbrush Replacement Service (Yes, Really!) Raises Seed"},

Its also inspired a wave of competing headsets that actually depend on the ecosystem building on top of it.Today, Google is taking the lid off of a new certification program that will unify these disparate headsets under a single badge: Works With Google Cardboard.By and giving Google a look at your headset, Google will certify a manufacturers headset design will work with all Cardboard software. Itll also give certified manufacturers a tool for generating headset profiles, whichwill be placed on the headset itself as a QR code and scanned by the user in the Cardboard app. The Cardboard app will then adjust apps built on the SDK for parameters set by the manufacturer, like focal length, inputs available, and the distance between each lens.Less than a year after Cardboards launch, theres already a need for software to tie the ecosystem together. Just a few weeks in we started to see Cardboard clones that riff on the originals open-source design, like the range of headsets from and These replicate the Cardboard experience and price while introducing nicer materials and extras like capacitive input and mounts for the Leap Motion hand tracker. LG is for those who buy its smartphones. If youre willing to spend a bit (okay, like five times) more, you start to find headsets that leverage the content available because of Cardboard, but also bring their own major features.On that side of the spectrum, you see cases like the , which hopes to provide a wider field of view that most consumer-tier headsets with amusingly large lenses. Also due out later this year: , which has a comfortable foam mask and an SDK that makes it easier to integrate its included motion controller. To be frank, these headsets wouldnt have a chance at decent adoption if not for the apps built for Cardboard: there simply wasnt much reason to make VR software for phones outside of very niche 3D-printed setups.These headsets depend on Cardboard apps to be useful at all (minus exclusive content that most cant talk about yet), but because they differ so much from the original design, require a separate SDK to truly optimize for. Googles new software profile could alleviate that, in exchange for tying your product to the search giants effort.In addition to the new tools for manufacturers, Google is also rolling out updates to its Android and Unity SDKs that should improve the end-user experience. The new version will reduce in-app drift, where the view continues to move even when the user doesnt move her head, and also enables more natural motion detection by simulating your headneck. Developers just starting to experiment with virtual reality can also check out , which let you quickly catch up on best practices.Google is rewarding the efforts of developers already publishing Cardboard-compatible apps by making them easier to discover in the Google Play Store, breaking them out into games, movies and music, and experiences (translation: like a game, but passive). While some startups have already started to use Cardboard and its clones to bring virtual reality apps to iOS (like, whose virtual tours arent even available on Android yet), Google still isnt addressing how its going to treat Cardboard apps on Apples platform  despite supporting the cross-platform Unity game engine.Most of Googles efforts with Cardboard have focused on simply enabling the visual experience on your phone. Now, it seems theyre also looking at bringing immersive audio to mobile.Google Cardboard product managerAndrew Nartkersays the company has acquired , a small team from Trinity College Dublin that works on spatially engineering audio to enhance virtual reality applications. The Cardboard team is also looking at tools people might want to use when virtual reality becomes more mainstream, as Google has also acquired , a VR painting application.", "title": "Google Announces Certification Program For CardboardClones"},

ItsU.S. only for now.The deviceconsists of a smart board that can weigh and track ingredients plus an app that recommends recipes, dispenses step by step meal making instructions and tracks nutritional intake, such as calories.The bigger twist is that the board isalso able to recognize some of your existingkitchenware, such as blenders and crock pots, when you retrofit them with dedicated Countertop adaptors.It can also integrate with fitness wearables, such as Jawbones UP, and with Apples Health data repository in order to factor in personal activity and sleep cycle data to its meal recommendations  with the pitch being that enables Countertopto offer tailorednutrition suggestions customized to the individual user.Countertop suggests personalized, easy-to-make meals or snacks that are healthy and tailored to your palate and nutritional goals, says Orange Chef CEO Santiago Merea. Were not trying to encourage folks to make a culinary masterpiece  in fact, most of our meals generally include five or less ingredients. We walk each user through the process of adding, prepping, and cooking their meal, and along the way we hope our users learn more about what kind of nutrition they are getting.The company behind Countertop, Orange Chef, started back in 2011,when itwas calledChef Sleeve, selling simple plastic sleeves to protect iPads being used in the kitchen. Its steadily expanded its culinary-focused product portfolio, pushing into connected kitchen devices in 2013  with a smartthat also focused on helping people eat healthier.Countertop continues the startupsexpansive trajectoryby looping inexisting kitchen devices via dishwasher-proof, heat-resistant NFC stickers (the aforementioned adaptors). So while there is some overlap with Prep Pad, the forthcoming gizmocan tap into more of your kitchen gadgetry.When the user places an appliance on Countertop, the app now understands the context of what theuser is trying to accomplish in the physical world and can give recommendations based on this, explains Merea.Furthermore, it helps our base understand when the appliance is being used during Make Mode (dumping ingredients step by step without pre-measuring) and scales the recipe accordingly according to the model, capacity, etc.Orange Chef has partnered with Vitamix blenders (which is also a seedinvestor) and Crock-Pot slow cookers to push the system, with dedicated NFC adaptors ($9.95 and $4.95 for those devices respectively, during the pre-order period).It says it plans to expand the system further, with Merea noting it is talking toseveral large, beloved kitchen brand mainstays about waysof integrating their product lines with Countertop.Despite the freshfocus on partners, Countertop does not require other gadgets to work. But partnering with existing kitchen brands is evidently its preferredroute togrow its own business.You dont even need add-on adapters or other kitchen gadgets for it to work. We made a bet that users will want to use Countertop with their Vitamix and Crock-Pot because these are two broadly adored products with communities of actively engaged users, adds Merea.Orange Chef has raised $4.8 million in seed fundingfrom investors includingGoogleVentures, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Lerer Ventures, Forerunner Ventures,Vitamix and individual angel investors including Warby Parker co-founder and co-Chief Executive Dave Gilboa.Its not currently breaking out sales of its existing devices, such as itsBluetooth kitchen scales, with Merea merelydubbing them assignificant.At this nascent stage in the Internet of Things startupsare having to come up with workarounds to blendtheir own connected devices with existing dumbware to massage their usefulness  such as Countertops NFS adaptors. How robust and usable these bridging techs are remains to be seen.The grand vision for the connected kitchen of the future is, presumably, a smart refrigerator which automatically orders the fresh ingredients requiredto prep your next set of nutritionally-optimized meals.

Its debut product, a desktop 3D printer for biomaterials, which was just demoed on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt NY  printing Van Goghs ear in replica, no less  combines hardware, software and wetware. Its the latter area where thecore innovation sits, saysco-founderDanny Cabrera.Biofabrication, the process ofartificially building living tissue structures, is not a new field  there ismore than a decade of research in this area already. ButCabrera and his co-founders believe they have spotted an opportunity tooverhaul expensive (circa$100,000+), large, complexlegacy devices  taking inspiration from the small, low-cost desktop 3D printers being used by the maker movement to extrude plastic.Instead of plastic, BioBots 3D printer uses a special ink that can be combined with biomaterials and living cells tobuild 3D living tissue and miniature human organs. The use-case at this point is for research and pre-clinical screening, such as drug testing (as a replacement for animal testing). Its not about3D printing replacement organs from a persons own cells  albeit developments in this areaare heading (incrementally) in that direction. More near term future potential for the tech is tohelp fosterbespoke disease therapies, according to Cabrera.We really see it as a product for pharmaceutical companies right now, for companies that are doing clinical drug testing, hetells TechCrunch. You can use these devices to build 3D living tissue models using human cells, and you can use those models which are way more complex than 2D tissues or animals. Theyreally recapitulate the function of the body. And you can use them to develop compounds for clinical settings. And catch the false positives before they get to clinical trials.Looking down the line for us we see this as a way to develop personalized therapy routines. So you can have patients coming into the clinic and we can take cells directly from the patient and build 3D tissues, miniature tissues, specifically for that patient and test different treatments, different drug routines and personalized therapys for patient-specific disease.Weve got this old school notion that we lump diseases together into categories and we give them names but diseases are all different from individual to individual, and our drug development process is sort of outdated  where we develop one drug for millions of people in these expensive clinical trials. Where today we can really use this technology to build one drug for one individual person, he adds.The startup began as a dorm-room projectas two of the co-founders were at the point of graduating from their computer science and biology degrees at the University of Pennsylvanialast June, drawing on their ownresearch interests in genetic engineering and tissue engineering.Our idea was we can use the same approaches that were used in the maker movement to build smaller and cheaper devices in biotech, saysCabrera.When we looked at what was out there we found devices that existed were huge  they looked like old mainframe computers, they took up entire rooms, they cost half a million dollars and were really difficult to operate. You needed technicians to operate them.The team won$5,000 in early capital viaa university competition to develop their first prototype. After selling one to a PhD student they decided the idea had legs, and were selected to gothrough theaccelerator in Philadelphia, pulling in $50,000 via that program last fall. Theyve now been shipping their initialbiomaterial printer for a few months, working closely with researchers to keep tuning the initial product (with a price-tag of around $5,000 on the machine for researchers who are helping with BioBots own development).Their recurring business model will beselling differentinks used as the base for printing different biomaterials with the printer. Today its launching a beta version of acartilage ink kit (costing $700).The printer uses visible (blue) light (combined with a compound photoinitiator thats contained withinits ink) to cure biomaterial structures, rather than pressure or UV light as some of the more established devices do. Cabrera says thisis more effective for printing living tissue since pressure and UV can both harm living cells, whereas the blue light its using does not have a detrimental impact on cells.To use thedevice to fabricate a tissue structure, such as a piece of bone, cartilage or liver, a user combinesthe BioBots photoinitiator powder with whatever living cells they want to print, plus binding factors to ensure the cells stick together.Our ink is three powders, they would add their fourth powder, which is the binding factor, and they would have to add their cells, mix that up for 5-10 minutes and then put it into the device, have their structure designs on AutoCAD or Solidworks or whatever CAD software they use. Our software would then convert that file to printer instructions, explainsCabrera.The BioBots printer has one extruder and uses hydraulic pressure to push the material out of a syringe. Once the biomaterial is inplace the printer shines visible blue light to harden the structure. Print timevaries, depending on the type of tissue youre attempting to fabricate, says Cabrera.So far our clients are literally working across the spectrum from bone to lung, liver, heart, brain, skin, cartilage using these processes, he adds. Noah Lichtenstein (), Jessica Livingston (), Shana Fisher () and Heidi Messer (). Whats your distribution strategy. How do you plan to distribute to hospitals and doctors, and does insurance cover this? Right now its more of a research tool. Were pushing it out to the pharmaceutical industry  really dealing with R&D departments, so were not really dealing with doctors. Were dealing with researchers right now. There are a lot of existing sales channels to sell to the pharmaceutical industry, and were trying to tap into those We are looking for somebody who has that expertise who we can bring onto the team. You have a list of a lot of partners  have they given you any feedback on this? Have they used it? What have they created? All of those clients I showed are really early adopters. Theyre people who bought the device before we had a kit. Everything they do theyll telling us about, theyre telling us exactly how theyre using the device, really allowing us to become a library for tissue engineering knowledge. Thats how we were able to figure out hey we really need a cartilage kit. And this is exactly the components we need to do this. The R&D on this would normally have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars at least, and months if not years, and we able to accelerate that process because of these key partnerships and these researchers working so closely with the device. How do you measure success? What is the metric you use when youre selling this device? So this is working the way that we need it to work. The device itself is a mechanical system, that we can measure pretty easily  the resolution, the precision of the device. Really its up to researchers to use the device in a way thats relevant for their work. For example for a pharmaceutical company, they would build a 3D living tissue  a key example that keeps coming up again is for cancers. Build a miniature tumor and test cancer drugs on it, and see which of these drugs work and which ones dont. Basically if you can recapitulate whats happening in the body, if you can mimic the function of the body thats success. If not then well just try it again. Thats the point of this digital fabrication technology  is that you can have really quick turnaround times, change up your designs really quickly. What does this replace currently? In more basic research in life sciences you can grow skin graft samples and test topical drugs on those samples. What do you see this replacing? First its not going to replace anything  its going to create new capabilities. So the first thing is youre literally adding an extra dimension to your tissue culture. Right now all this stuff is done in 2D, and now suddenly you can do it in 3D. Physiologically thats a lot more relevant. Cells in 3D behave very differently than they do in 2D. So companies are really excited to be working with this technology and its something theyve been looking for for a while. And as far as what we see it replacing in the future, in places like Europe where theyve banned animal testing in cosmetics thats a key area we can go into and begin being that replacement for animals. And eventually we see it being a replacement for the entire clinical development of drugs.Ideally if youre going to test drugs on one person at a time youd develop drugs very specifically for that person but nobody wants to be that guinea pig. Suddenly we can take cells directly from the patient, build these 3D tissues, and develop drugs  not on the patient but on their cells and on tissue constructs that are really built from their own body. There are other companies working on 3D printing as regard to medicine. Can you talk a little bit more about this technique youve used thats not going to kill the cells? How you came across it without a ton of funding? How defensible it is? What other folks might be doing that could do something similar? I was a student at Penn., and right after I graduated I had a friend  the other founder Ricardo  he was working on the prototypes for this device. And after I graduated we literally bought three Ikea desks, pushed off the furniture on top of a bar where we were living and we stumbled across these sets of chemistry that people had used for a wide variety of different applications. We were looking for something we could use to not kill the cells, basically. And we stumbled into this  basically its a compound  its a chemical that works with visible light. And thought that sounds awesome. And we tried it and it worked really well. Nobody has actually used visible light  in the IP landscape  for building 3D living tissues. And so that was a space that we thought we can really own. And it makes a lot of sense for biology. So we filed those patents earlier this year. We really think its defensible, and not only defensible  we really think its the best way to build these tissues.", "title": "BioBots Is A 3D Printer For LivingCells"},

Apples first wearable device has enjoyed one of the longest pre-launch promotional cycles of any of its products, and with good reason its a very different gadget from anything Apple has created before.Weve had a few days to try out the Apple Watch and establish some early impressions, and from set-up to our initial daily use experience, the smart watch is definitely a novel experience in a computer device. As soon as you open the box, its apparent that Apple is working on a plan to change how we think about personal computing on a grand scale  the Apple Watch is not just, as some might think, a wrist-mounted notification display for your iPhone.The setup of the Apple Watch is, however, primarily a phone-based activity. When you power on the device for the first time, it displays a sort of particle cloud graphic on its display, which is dynamic and animated and which essentially acts as a QR code might, albeit with stunning visual effects that have little in common aesthetically with crude black and white barcodes. In the Apple Watch app thats now present on all iPhones running iOS 8.3 or higher, you tap a link to Start Pairing and enter a camera preview screen. Centering the particle cloud graphic in the iPhones display will trigger the pairing process, connecting the two devices via Bluetooth without any messy manual menu work required.Theres a bit of waiting involved after you enter your Apple ID credentials as the Watch transfers over any apps you already have on your device, but this can happen in the background and after a few minutes, youll receive a notification telling you youre up and running.Whats unusual about the Apple Watch so far is that the setup process involves the most direct attention and interaction time youll spend with the gadget. Setting up notifications, health profile options and customizing your watch face are the most time we spent directly manipulating our devices thus far  the rest of the time, the Apple Watch works best when capturing your attention only for tiny snippets and select moments, during which youll probably use only a few short taps to dismiss a notice or format and send a quick response.The Watch is a front-heavy device, meaning you spend a lot of time admiring the hardware, deciding on band combinations and finishes, and setting up the gadget to your liking, after which it melts pleasantly into the background, or at least thats how it seems after the first few days. We describe the band swapping process and other setup information in more detail in the video above, but stay tuned over at our Apple Watch Diary, which will receive regular updates, as we share more about how weve been using the Watch (and how our experiences differ based on personal use cases) to get a clue how the gadget may or may not work for you.", "title": "Say Hello To The AppleWatch"},

In case you missed it, a couple of Apple Watch band trading sites recently , reportedly offering owners the ability to swap out the includedextra watchband with someone elses for a small fee. Unfortunately, you two full watchbands with your purchase, despite what Apples website seems to claim.The larger of the two sites, , has been getting some blog for what initially sounds like a brilliantidea. The site says it aims tohelp Apple Watch Sport owners switch out their unused strap by exchanging it for one of a different size and/or color. BandSwapper would collect a $6 fee then send back the new Sport Band the customer requested.The ideafor band-swapping came about because you it would allow you to order combinations of watch and straps that wouldnt otherwise have been available. (Some straps are only sold with certain watches, that is.) But it became even more attractive an option when it appeared that Apple Sport Watch models actuallyshipped with two bands: one for smaller wrists and one for larger wrists. The confusion came in because Apples website readstwo bands when listing what its Sport Watch package included.After receiving your Watch, you would, in theory, only end up using one of the bands  whichever was the correct size for your wrist. The other you could swap!Another website,, is offering a similarswapping service. But there, buyers and sellers connect directly and mail each other unused straps or agree to meet up locally.The idea, frankly, seemed genius.Sadly, its not going to work exactly like that.You see, Apple Sport Watch models technically do come with two bands, but in practice, its not two bands, but rather three pieces. Theres one piece that attaches to one end of the watch with the fastener, and then two additional bands (the side with the holes) that attach to the other side of the watch. These two bands come in two different lengths  a S/M size for smaller wrists and an M/L size for larger wrists.In other words, you wont have an entire extra band to swap.Now, I guess you could start a new fashion trend and swap your extra half band for a half band of a different color. (I betthis look would have really taken off back in the 80s!). But thats not what people thought they were signing up for, in many cases. You could also swap out your current band (the two pieces) in case you have buyers remorse over your original selection, or just get bored with the band after some time.Or, as noted above, you could swap for a band that you wouldnt have otherwise been able to order because it only comes with a particular watch model.ButBandSwapper is adding to the confusion by misleadingpotential customers who are questioning whether or not there are two full bands included with Sport Watch purchases by referring to those claims as speculation.Speculation is not confirmation.  BandSwapper (@bandswapper) . thanks for the article. Your update mentions readers have pointed out.. Please note that speculation is not confirmation.

The smartphone has some serious bona fides when it comes to hardware specs, including a quad HD (1440 x 2560) 5.5-inch screen which uses new quantum display tech for better color reproduction, a completely redesigned camera with a larger sensor, Snapdragon 808 and an expandable microSD slot for more storage.The G4s most stunning feature might be its unique industrial design, which follows other top-end device makers in angling for quality craftsmanship and materials, but which ends up at a very different destination from most. That leather back option is the result of over three years of research, and carries a special LG-designed treatment aimed at making it water-resistant and less susceptible to scratches and mark-ups.In addition to the brown finish weve seen bandied about so much already, there are beige, sky blue and black versions coming, with additional colors planned. If leather isnt your thing, other variants use a hammered pattern back finished in metal or ceramic-painted white plastic. Bonus: All G4 backs are interchangeable with one another.LG has also taken some cues from its more experimental phone designs for the G4  the new flagship has a subtle curve, which, while not as pronounced as the arch of the G Flex 2, is designed to provide a better hand feel, as well as bolster resistance to breakage from direct falls.That new display is said to have better outdoor visibility, lower-power consumption and is also up to the DCI standard, an agreed-uponreference class for color spectrum used by Disney, 20th Century Fox, Sony and many others for film and television. LG says that by contrast, displays based on AMOLED tech are oversaturated when compared to their own panels.As for that new camera, LG is once again going with a 16-megapixel sensor on the back, but its a larger sensor versus the G3, and it has a super bright f/1.8 aperture, both of which should help with low light image capture. The image stabilization tech used should be twice as effective, and is the most powerful on the smartphone market, per the company.In addition to capturing RAW, advanced photographers can also enter manual mode to control things like shutter speed, ISO, white balance and more. A special sensor positioned under the flash is also new, and helps to determine true whites for more accurate color balance without WB manipulation.That Snapdragon 808 under the hood is a 64-bit hexacore CPU clocked at 1.8GHz, and should provide plenty smooth performance for both launching and using apps. Paired with the 3,000 mAh battery the G4 is sporting, users can expect just under 20 hours of talk time on a full charge, or around 10.7 hours of web browsing time. It also has 3GB of RAM, and ships with 32GB of internal storage, in addition to offering that microSD slot as mentioned above.Whats nice about this years LG flagship is that the OS was created with Google users in mind, meaning that Googles suite of productivity apps comes pre-installed, and that Chrome is the default browser choice. Theres OS-level Chromecast support, too, for sharing from your onboard music library and gallery apps, and most of LGs own apps feature Android Wear extensions out of the box. You also get 100GB of free Google Drive storage for two years with G4 purchase.The LG G4 goes on sale in Korea first, with a street date of April 29, and will arrive in the U.S. by the end of May or the beginning of June.", "title": "This Is The LGG4"},

That one, too, is based on the Rockchip quad-core processor and will also come in 2GB and 4GB versions. Itll go on sale at Amazon in May.The new Chromebooks from Haier and Hisense are powered by s(SoC). Chances are you just did a double-take when you read that. Rockchip isnt exactly a household name, after all. But this companyisnt some fly-by-night outfit. The company, which was founded in 2001, isone of the leading fabless semiconductor firms in China and a strategic agreement with Intel to incorporate its Atom cores into some of its products. The 3288 SoC is an ARM chip, however, based on the 32-bit quad-core Cortex 17 design.For most use cases, the 3288 should offer decent browsing speeds.We havent been able to see it in action yet, but it outperforms some of Intels recent Atom chips in .The basic specs for the Hisense and Haier Chromebooks are essentially the same: 2GB of RAM, 16GB eMMC flash storage. Both feature two USB ports, and SD Card reader and HDMI output, as well a 720p webcam and WiFi and Bluetooth antennas. Both devices support Googles always-on OK Google voice commands and come with Googles slightly modified Chrome keyboard.Besides the $149 version, Haier will also offer a second version of its Chromebook with a larger  and removable  battery that promises 10 hours of battery life. For the regular version,Haier promises 10hours of battery life, and forHisense, eight-and-a-half.The display is often the major negative of cheaper devices.Rockchip promises that itsbuilt-in GPU can handle 4K video, but the display on these new devices isnt all that close to 4K.The Haier Chromebook weighs in at 2.54 lbs (similar to an 11-inch MacBook Air), and the Hisense one at 3.3 lbs (thats exactly the same as the Chromebook Pixel).Both Haier and Hisense note that while the devices are cheap, they will still be sturdy. Hisense, for example, has added a metal palm rest to its machine, which should make it feel better than some of the more expensive plastic Chromebooks (we should get a review unit soon).With the launch of these devices, the Chrome OS ecosystem pulls side-by-side with the Windows world, where Microsoft hopes its OEMs will also offer $149 laptops based on Windows 10 soon.The Asus Chromebit, which should retail for under $99, is also a Rockchip device with 2GB of RAM and the same 16GB of eMMC flash storage as the Chromebooks. Its basically a Chromebox on a candy bar-sized stick (Im actually surprised its not called the Chromestick).As an HDMI stick its clearly targeted at enterprises that may want to use it for mobile workers and maybe companies that want to use it for in-store displays (Google already has a similar program for Chromeboxes, after all).

If implemented, this could take the sting out of upgrades, or make it even easier to expand your iOS universe with newly acquired additions like iPads, or the Apple Watch.The new patent application describes packaging that includes a Tap here sticker, indicating where a user should tap their existing device. The brand new packaged device would then be able to communicate via some kind of short-range wireless communication method, like Bluetooth or NFC, and transfer settings, lock screen art, user information and even a list of apps to download from the existing gadget to the one in the box.Apples invention includes provisions for multiple power modes for the packaged device. This would allow it to offer both a completely non-powered state, likely used for transport from factory to retail stores or distribution enters, for instance; and a low-power state, whereby it would be able to receive inbound communication requests from a users existing device for setup, prompting it to shift into full-power mode.The patent goes further, discussing situations in which the packaged device would occasionally transmit discovery messages in its low power state, perhaps based on a timer, or prompted by activity detected by its internal accelerometer. These could be used to ping owned devices about the setup process once the packaged device is taken home, but its also described as being able to facilitate in-store purchases: Meaning, when you pull a boxed iPad off a shelf, it could give you a message on your iPhone asking you to add it to your shopping cart.It goes further still, suggesting that the communication between the two devices could first ascertain whether the packaged device was actually purchased first, locking it from setup in cases where it determines that it has been stolen instead. It could use transmissions from store staff to authorize it, for example, or pre-shipping authorization for a set email address, if mailed.The patent is fairly amazing in terms of scope and potential impact on the retail and gadget setup experience, and was only filed in the third quarter of last year, meaning it could very easily still make its way to production devices.", "title": "Apple Explores Ways To Secure, Set Up And Sell iOS Devices While Still In TheBox"},

It was the way things had been for years, decades even.But when Eldeebs brother was born with a rare genetic condition called ectodermal dysplasia, everything changed immediately. Because of the condition, Eldeebs infant brother couldnt sweat. And given Egypts humid climate, this meant a certain and swift death.His father, who had been applying every year for a green card for the past 15 years, fortunately had wonone in the lottery. Roughlytwo weeks after Eldeebs brother was born, they left everything they had ever known behind.We had no option but to move right away. We knew we had to come to the U.S., he said. We went to New York and we were like, lets figure life out.In the beginning, Eldeebwent to school for a few weeks. But the family needed money, so he started working 12-hour shifts at a pizza shop to earn about $20 a day in Astoria, Queens. During the New Yorks sweltering summers, they all took turns giving his little brother constant showers.Eldeeb working in a Queens pizza shop as a child shortly after immigrating to the U.S.We couldnt even make rent and my dad had a hard time finding work, Eldeeb said. They had to return to Egypt briefly for a year before coming back again.The work shifts kept Eldeeb from attending middleschool regularly.Then, in high school,bad luck hit again.Thehouse his family was living in burned down after a repairman, who was smoking a cigarette while fixing the boiler, accidentally instigated a massive explosion and fire. They ended up in a Red Crossshelter.This is where things could have gone from bad to worse. But there were benefitsfrom being in a shelter.Forthe first time in a long time, the family didnt have to worry about rent.Food stamps were paying for things to eat. And Eldeeb could start to think about other things like school.He started going to a free gym in Harlem.He was a scrawny kid from Queens, but others took him under their wing and taught him how to lift and work out.People motivated me and encouraged me, he said.That was the first time I felt like I was getting better. It was the first time I felt like I was achieving anything in life.He started to catch up on school by watching Khan Academyvideos. He said he finished every videothat was available at the time, and then started going to Saturday and Sunday school on the side.He finished 11th and 12th grade ina singleyear, then went to Queens College and got an applied math degree in 2 1/2 years. He heard about atransfer program to Columbia and made the switch to study computer science. Along the way, he also went through to teach low-income residents of Queens how to code.Columbia was intimidating at first. That fall, Humans of New York photographer Brandon Stanton, caught Eldeeb in the subway and .A lot of his classmates had no idea about Eldeebs past. But once that Humans of New York photo went viral, they began to help him out.Throughout his entire time in college, Eldeeb would work as a personal trainer, using the skills he learned in that Harlem gym to coach others and make extra money.In Columbias computer science program, Eldeeb would also end upmeetinghis co-founder Joshua Augustin, who was studying computer vision.Because personal training had been so transformative for Eldeeb, hewanted to figure out a way to make it more accessible to everyone else. In big cities like New York and San Francisco, trainers can cost $100 or more an hour. Its prohibitively expensive.Using Augustins computer vision talents, they built aset-up that mixes a Kinect camera and a large flatscreen TV. It records your work out and can point out when your angles are off or if your posture is misaligned. It also has timers so you can track and control how long you rest between reps.More importantly, Smartspot keeps video logs so that if you want a personal trainer to review your progress, you can do it more affordably. Personal training, like hair cuts, is a non-tradable service. That means you have to find a provider where you are, and your schedule has to align with theirs.From a practical level, this means that personal trainers have to charge high hourly rates during peak times after work in order to compensate for the lack of work during the middle of the day.With Smartspots systems, Eldeeb and Augustin think that this would make it easier for people to rely on trainers from other parts of the country or even the world to review their progress, correct their technique and motivate them. (Kind of like how another YC-backed company 7 Cups of Tea allows anyone to seek online counseling or therapy from anywhere.)They sell the equipment for $2,500 to gyms. Gym members can use it for free, but if they want additional personal training, they can pay a fraction of the cost of a normal personal trainer to have one review their workouts and coach them on technique.At the Potrero Hill gym I met the pair at, about 60 percent of the membership had used Smartspot.When I was a personal trainer, I could see how almost everyone else in the gym was doing the exercises wrong. They couldnt afford a trainer, and the whole dream here is to make training more affordable to the American population.The pair are demo-ing Smartspot at Y Combinator today. Eldeebs parents dont really have any idea what Y Combinator is, nor did they know what Columbia University was.My dad has been supportive of me with exercise my whole life, Eldeeb said. Even though he has no idea what Im doing right now or how to make a company in America, he believed that I could go do it.", "title": "Smartspots Tale: From A Farm In Egypt To Building A YC Computer Vision Startup For"},

Instead of liquid Li-ion, Sakti3s batteries use solid lithium electrodes, which makes it much better at storing more energy in smaller spaces, and at doing so in a safer manner, with a cheap and easy manufacturing method.Dysons interest, as noted above, could definitely be around its handheld vacuums, which currently max out at around 20 minutes of unplugged power.

Food gets evenly cooked all the way through instead of being charred and dry on the outside and raw on the inside. Nomikus immersion circulator has a knob that you rotate to theexact temperature that you want, then you drop your sealed ingredientsinto a bucket full of water and wait.Since launching the company, they have created some of the most successful food-related Kickstarters of all time by raising more than $1.3 million in two separate campaigns. The original version of the product is alsoin 7,000 homes.Now theyve joined YCombinatorand are bringing a sous vide recipe app to the market. Called Tender, it contains recipes from well-known chefs likeRene Redzepi, Kristen Kish and Mei Lin. It also lets you remotely control your Nomiku and share recipes with others.Google is the main source that people use for sous vide recipes,said co-founder Lisa Fetterman.

Theyll expect to hire at least six local workersto build products once the factory is set up.We basically went into a black hole studying manufacturing in China,said Fetterman of the time the pair and their third co-founderWipopBamSuppipat hustledtogether in China and Southeast Asia to build the first version of the Nomiku.

The news was announced by Kano co-founder Alex Kleinon stage, here at .Kano is also offering its users and the wider tech community the chance to invest in the round, via the  with up to $500,000 available for community backers. The round is basically over-subscribed so whatever the community will take theyre going to have a certain amount that were allocating for the community, addsco-founder and CEO Yonatan Raz-Fridman.The Quire community outreach follows Kanosuse of the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform,, to get its first product to market. Itraised via that platform, shipping its first batch of 18,000 Kano kits to Kickstarter backers . Its now shipped more than 40,000 kits to more than 30,000 customers in all.Raz-Fridman tellsTechCrunch the new funding will be used forfour main goals: firstly extending the product platform  by creating more software content that runs onthe Kano OS, and also by developingadd-on hardware kits to expand into additional plug and play modular hardware (something Klein has ).Expanding Kanos content and ecosystem isa crucial piece, given that the startupsambitions to scale beyondbeing just anotherbit player in anincreasingly crowded learn to code movement. Itsmission and vision is to build an entirecomputer company. And for that ecosystem is all.Secondly, the funding will go on expanding the business.

One per cent of Kano units sold per year will also be donated to institutions and individuals who cant afford to buy them. And one per cent of employees timewill go to Academy work and activities. (Kano is following the salesforce.com Foundations 1-1-1 model here.)The fourth spending pushwill go on stepping up a gear on the hiring front to allow Kano to ramp up activity across all business functions. Were planning to use some of the funding to build a team, build professional managers that can help us scale the business, bring more committed, talented developers, designers, product shapers to really make the next step into becoming a global successful computer company, addsRaz-Fridman.We want to build something for the next decade, not for the next few years. And we know that its only going to be possible if we really build that incredible culture internally, that is driven by the notion that people is everything.We are setting for ourselves a significant product design and development challenge. Which is to take this new world of small, cheap, open, hackable devices and make it truly friendly for the next 500 million, adds Klein, who heads up product for Kano. We believe fundamentally that there is a moment now, an inflection point  not merely for people to feel comfortable using computers in their day to day life but making them themselves.[Kano] presents code as an art, as something that is simple, as something that is human. Now were trying to take that ethos to a larger scale, toreally build a new type of computer company from the ground up, one that is predicated on creativity, rather than just consumption.In addition to the new funding,Kano has today announced a new version of its core product  which itscalling the New Kano. Thistakes advantage of the new 6x faster Raspberry Pi 2 (announced ) to offer additional apps and creative projects that can run more smoothly on the beefier Pi hardware. The price for the kit remains at $149.You can now make art with these beautiful step by step spells, youre making gradients, fractals, characters, its sort of like a generative painting program where everything you create is immediately accessible to another artist, maybe all the way across the globe, says Klein.Using it[the Pi 2 its]an incredible difference. Web browsing especially, its fast, its quick, the videos load well, the gaming  the FPS is higher  its a lean, mean, little board. Especially at this price.Another newproject is a text adventure game called Terminal Quest where kidsuseLinux commands as magic spells to solve the mystery and learn some coding along the way. It connects back to the core Kano idea of using simple step-by-step story telling to make technology feel human, he adds.Other additions arenew code blocks for existing games forthe Kano OS, such asMinecraft and Pong. Andon Kano World, itssocial platform, Klein notes theres a new project where kids can build their ownWhatsApp client.Existing Kano boards are not being obsoleted by the New Kano.The team has comeup with what its calling a power up kit  costing $89  thatwill let kids repurpose theirPi 1 board into a Internet of Things device by incorporatingan LED shield into the mix so they can use it for other DIYhardware projects likean alarm clock or a Pac-Man game.

The first was a simple intro experience, giving you a fun scene to look at that reacted based on your gaze. It then moved on to a scene that was more of a fun loop of input and sensory experiments than a game, taking advantage of the DualShock 4 controllers motion sensing and touchpad to interact with PlayStations cute robots more directly.One of the fun things Sonys experimenting with is positional audio  when you move objects around that generate sound, like an in-game cell phone, the sound moves around in your headphones.Sony clearly understand the importance of sound when immersing a player in a scene.The second demo felt more like a traditional game experience. In the first scene, an intimidating dude with a blowtorch makes obscene threats that serve as reactions to where you look in the shady garage you seem to be trapped in. In the following flashback sequence, you use the PlayStation Move controllers (which look like Wii controllers, but with colorful orbs on top so the camera can track them) to interact with the drawers on a fancy old-fashioned desk. Inside the drawers, you find magazines and a gun, and when you solve a quick puzzle, the scene turns into the most immersive arcade shooter Ive ever played.You play this segment standing up, but quickly realize that leaves you vulnerable to gunfire. As enemies poured into the room I dropped behind the desk, and instead of pressing a button to move in and out of cover, I could peek up to see if enemies were exposed. There wasnt a visible cross hair in the demo  instead, you really have to aim down the sight of your handgun.Unlike its competitors, which require a high-end computer or have you drop-in your phone, Sonys headset is powered by the PS4. The latest PlayStation is essentially a mid-tier gaming PC from 2013, so based on my time with Oculus dev kits I guessed going into the demo that performance might be an issue  in every VR demo Ive gotten to this point, the headset was connected to a PC with a GPU notably faster than that in Sonys console. In VR, low frame rates or inconsistent tracking can make you nauseous, soId definitely notice if the PS4 wasnt able to handle it.The headset is bulky, but distributes its weight comfortably around the top of your head. You can also use any headphones youd like.It turns out that with clever lighting and smaller environments, the PS4 doesnt have trouble rendering VR experiences that look like modern games without stutters. And whereas those watching someone play a game in Oculus either cant see what the player is looking at, or its shown on your monitor as the same split image sent to the headset,Sony actually renders a version of what the player is looking aton the TV the PS4 is connected to as a full-screen image.The first demo I played was even rendering at 120 frames per second in the headset  way past what you see on VR demos powered by phones or on older Oculus dev kits. I have a feeling we wont get huge open worlds in the first generation of games made for Project Morpheus, but Sonys first-party studios show the console can handle VR.This smooth rendering, combined with head tracking from the PlayStation 4s camera, led to an experience with few moments where my movement didnt line up perfectly with what I saw in the headset.I can see how it looks, but you dont feel like an absolute dork as you play.As fellow , the fact that PlayStations been working on its Move controllers for more than half a decade gives it a huge leg up in terms of providing immersive control. While also has motion-sensing controllers for each hand , the Oculus developer community relies on an assortment of different control schemes, from controllers to cameras watching your hands. Sonys going to be able to cut through the confusion and offer a standard package that developers can build for, saving time and resources.On the other hand, Oculuss focus on seated gameplay means the wire strapped to your headset doesnt get in your way. Like the HTC Vive, Project Morpheus lets you stand up and move around (in a limited space, mind you), and that means that tripping over the wire is a potential issue. Dr. Marks had to hold it aloft to keep it out of my way, and in a demo of the Vive, I had to wear a harness to keep its cable away. I dont think this is a huge hurdle for either device, but fell down while in VR might become the new threw a Wii-mote through the TV.With more than 20 million PS4s already in peoples homes, Sony has a larger addressable market thancompetitors relying on PC gamers with high-end machines. I think Sony has nailed the headset and software experience with Morpheus, cutting out a lot of the frustrations involved with headsets currently on the market. The biggest factor to watch for now is content  if Sony can line up interesting games, Morpheus could be the device that convinces millions they need VR in their living room when it .", "title": "Hands On With PlayStations Virtual RealityHeadset"},

In an update to the companys iOS and Android applications, users will now be able to share their Tiles with others, including friends, family, roommates, or anyone else they choose in order to increase the chances that their Tile  and whatever its attached to  gets found.The Tile tracker, by way of background, originally began as a device before raising to fuel its growth. The company had sold over half a million of its small, white square-shaped devices as of last fall, but declined to provide any updated numbers today. Instead, CEO Mike Farley references a different metric: he says the Tile community is finding over 250,000 items every day.That includes those who are using the Tile devices to locate lost items still in Bluetooth range, as well as those wholeverage Tiles larger network. The way the Tile works is that its able to tap into itscommunity of users who have the companys app installed on their smartphones in order to help peoplewith missing items locate them, even when that item is no longer nearby.However, relying on a network isnt always as helpful as just asking a friend to help you find something. Thats where Shared Tiles comes in. Not only does it mean you can ask your own micro-community for help, it also means that a single Tile can be used among a group, too.You may be out of town or just at the office, but someone else in your household or who you trust can help you find something youve lost just by installing the app on their phone. That way, couples can search together for missing keys, for example. Or if you go out of town, your roommates can still locate the remote that got lost in the sofa cushions, even though the Tile attached to it was originally associated only with your phone and account.Lost items play a little melody while youre hunting for them, which makes it easier to find them when misplaced.The feature is a minor onefor Tilesapp, but speaks to the companysability to make its hardware more usable by way of software upgrades. In the future, Farley says there are plans to do more with the software, too, including adding the ability for users to thank the strangers who helped them locate a lost item. He even hinted at the possibility of adding a reward option, which could encourage users to join in the lost item hunt for something of value to a Tile user.But in the near future, Tile is focused on developing its business model which will involve a subscription-based business. Unlike a number of other lost item trackers, Tiles dont include a user replaceable battery. That means yourTile will eventually stop working, but the decision to go this route was deliberate. Farley felt that users would simply abandon the devices after the battery dies  that its too much hassle to replace it. Plus, by eliminating the need to allow the Tile to open up, the design of the dongle can be improved, too.So Tiles goal instead will be to encourage users to sign up for a replacement program that would ship out new Tiles when the older ones near the end of their life.Farley says details on how this program will work will arrive in the next couple of months.But in the meantime, the company is having a little fun with its Tile community. Right now, Tile is hosting an Easter Egg hunt that uses the Tile app to find hidden eggs around San Francisco, one of which includes a $1,000 prize as a reward for its discovery. (The companys page has more on this).As for the new sharing feature, thats arriving today in the Tile apps for both and .

The application, published by the USPTO today (via ) features a virtual keyboard design that resembles the current Magic Trackpad accessory in its construction, with a smooth piece of aluminum used instead of physical buttons. Virtual buttons without touch-based input are used instead, and Apple employs haptics to provide feedback for key presses.Its own taptic version of haptic feedback could theoretically be used in the way its employed with the new Apple has created for its MacBook and 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro. This would allow users to get the sensation that they were actually pressing physical keys, even though the keyboard itself would have no mechanical movement, which would answer one of the biggest criticisms users have of virtual keyboards.Apple could also then offer up user customizations for the input device, configurable via software, the way it has on the Force Touch trackpad. You might be able to select different depth of key press sensations, depending on preference, or use Force Touch (secondary, deeper presses) to activate features like special characters, accents for other languages, or for triggering function keys.Virtual input for things like standalone or MacBook keyboards has a lot in the way of potential benefits  imagine a keyboard that never needs dusting, or even thinner MacBooks thanks to the elimination of the need to build-in key travel. Its also just less mechanically complex, which should make for longer life without failure. Apples recent advances with taptics could finally mean that this kind of keyboard is possible without the drawbacks of eliminating the physical typing sensation, which would differentiate it from other efforts to do the same.Weve already seen many predict that next, but Apples tech is also a logical next step for its hardware keyboards, too.", "title": "Apple Researching Taptic Feedback For Keyboards With No PhysicalKeys"},

Trying to crack the code is interesting. Were not super there yet, and not just Quirky, but everyone [in this space], he said in an interview with Andreessen Horowitz partner Scott Weiss at South by Southwest today.The first issue is installation. Ideally you open the box, plug it in and youre done, but in reality there are a number of issues. A product like an internet-connected lock could require taking out your old lock, drilling a hole and installing the new one. A smart thermostat like Nest could still require connecting wires. Not everyone is going to be comfortable doing that, Kaufman explained.The second problem is what Kaufman called provisioning. Once you figure out how to install the product, there has to be a way to connect to the internet.There is no simple way to connect to WiFi just yet and that could bea huge leap for some people.The next problem is battery life. Kaufman joked his company developed a smart egg tray that needed new batteries more often than most people needed eggs. He pointed out if you have to change the battery on three door locks and 25 window locks every six months, you arent going to be a happy customer.And theyrecompeting with simple devices like the light switch that almost neverrequires any type of maintenance. It just works. It doesnt require changing batteries or software upgrades.The final problem is how you interact with a device from a software perspective, and take advantage of the data to improve efficiency. Right now, you look at the data and you have to physically do something to improve efficiency, he said.Whenever you can use data to make the interface simpler or more transparent, thats where it gets interesting. Now we are displaying information and customers need to act. Fast-forward 12 months and you [could] get a report and click abuttontosave x dollars a month. Instead of changing settingsmanually, [we need to] use data to make the processprogrammable [and begin to automate it], he explained.As one questioner put after the talk, how do you get to the point so that your grandmother can use these devices?Theyvegot a long way to go from that perspective.Security is anotherbig issue when you get into smart or connected homes, whether its protecting these devices from hackers or data privacy. Nobody wants a hacked smart lock or to sharedata about their heating and cooling, electricity usage or their comings and goings with a device manufacturer and organizations that sell these devices have to tread carefully here.Kaufman said another problem was simple education at the retail level. DIY storeemployees with years of experience selling traditional products, need training to sell newer connected products. Startups with small budgets might not have the moneyto createthese programs to get retail staffs up to speed.Kaufman said hiscompany, , was launched with the idea of making inventingmore accessible. Itrelies on itscommunity to help develop new products, and to-date it has had various degrees of success. In around 2013, it began concentrating on smart connected devices after a vast majority of the submissions had internet connectivity.While it has given a forum for inventors to create and market products, the company has.Weiss likened the connected home evolution to the early days of the PC. We might be past the hobbyist stage, but it still requires a certain level of technical aptitude to make these deviceswork. Until you automate big portions of the process, connected devices will remain in the realm of nerds for now.", "title": "Connected Home Products Need To Shift From Nerds ToNormals"},

He had his eye on a mid-level Apple Watch Steel version, which will start around $668 USD in China, as opposed to the starting U.S. price point of $549.Zeng, 21, was arrested on Tuesday at a train station after trying to sell drugs to a friend. Thanks to Apples intense focus on China, we can probably expect more of this.Apple has been with its planned trajectory in China. The company wants to expand its current list of 15 retail stores in China to 25 by the end of the year.Yesterday reported that Apple may face issues pushing the Apple Watch in China not only because of its notably higher price tag (the top-end Watch Edition model starts at $11k+ USD and tops out at $18k), but because of existing knock-offs in the Chinese market as well as less demand for health-related products.Obviously, Zengs crime of Apple Watch passion is pretty anecdotal, but it will be important to take a harder look at these two price points as Apple enters its target market with this new product category.The on the lower end of the luxury market, as characterized by , is looking for brands that attract at an impressive but not back-breaking price point. However, the true luxury shopper (the shopper hopes will buy the gold Watch Edition) may be far more interested in the status that comes along with a watch from Breguet, or Patek Philippe, or Audemars Piguet.At least in the world of fashion, the luxury consumer is becoming more sophisticated, fading from brands like Louis Vuitton and shifting more towards understated brands that still say luxury without the logo. Still, that bright screen (not to mention feature sets that will incite conspicuous behavior, like taking a call on your wrist) wont help the Apple Watch keep a low profile.Apple created the first electronic status symbols. The iPod was first and I suspect the company is now kicking itself for not making a solid gold Shuffle for the fashion-forward. But when the iPhone came along, it was the ultimate smartphone. When it came to owning a smartphone, there was no greater show of status.With the Apple Watch, the company is treading a delicate line between a product that must simultaneously act as a status symbol and an understated luxury accessory.Then again, at least one Chinese man has sold drugs to afford a new Apple Watch, so the question is no longer whether or not Apples Watch line will be a success. With the flexibility in Apples supply chain, the company can make it so.The real question is whether or not the gold Watch Edition, with one foot in the tech world and the other in the realm of fashion, will win over the hearts and minds of big-spending luxury shoppers. Both at home and abroad.Another unrelated afterthought:The Apple Watch will likely be highly recognizable. Weve already seen our first crime related to its acquisition. And it isnt clear what kind of security precautions are in place should the Apple Watch be stolen. Will we see the same uptick in thefts of the Apple Watch the way we did with the iPhone before Remote Lock functionality became available?", "title": "Will The Apple Watch Be Chinas NewAddiction?"},

The TI sensor detects the distance and angle of the magnetic strip on the belt to calculate whether the wearer isslouching or sitting up nice and straight.The app then uses that data tokeep track of the wearers posture score  encouraging them to sit better/slouch less.I look at the sum of square distances between different magnetometerpositions, explains Heenan. So basically your belt is a magnet and the sensor tag measures magnetic fields.And when you lean over, or you slouch, youre basically increasing the distance to the magnet. I can tell the angle as well.Your goal is to keep yourposture score as close to 100 as possible.As well as displaying a large graphic of the users posture (and their posture score) within the app, Posture.iointegrates with the menu bar to display a more discreetreminder of how youre currently sitting.

I wanted something that would let me keep my flow when codingI wanted something low cost, easy to use and I found it to be quite robust.A secondary component of the hack involves using the Leap Motion gesture controllerto directthe user to perform atypicalhand exercises which aredesigned to relieve the damaging repetition of typing. Performing a series of hand passes over the controller increases the users posture score.I took some of those exercises from the hand therapy exercises I learnt when I was recovering from the RSI injury, he notes.

It uses Bluetooth LE to connect to your device, and has a 42 mm watch face, with a 1.22-inch 240204 display. The device uses touch-based input, but depends on a tapping interface using the home area that takes up a small chunk of the bottom of the round screen, similar to the Moto 360s bottom black bar. A printed exterior bezel with number markers at 12, 3, 6 and 9 helps hide the fact that it isnt a full circle.The watch has a hidden USB 2.0 port in the band that lets it charge to full capacity in just an hour, which is a nice change from the field of proprietary and induction chargers used by many manufacturers in terms of convenience. A full battery charge should provide between two and five days of use, according to the company, depending on your usage.Alcatels device will have limitations in terms of function vs. the Apple Watch on iPhone, of course, as itll be limited to access privileges afforded accessories like the Pebble. That still means itll be able to control camera shutter functions, as well as music playback, however, and provide notifications. On Android, it should have more flexibility in terms of accessing system features. It also has a built-in heart rate sensor, electronic campus, gyroscope, altimeter and NFC tag, and is IP67 water- and dust-resistant.The device works with smartphones running Android 4.3 or higher, and with iPhone 4S or newer with at least iOS 7 installed.", "title": "Alcatel OneTouchs Cross-Platform Smartwatch Opens Pre-Orders For$150"},

Frankly, after trying the tech out in person, Id be more surprised it wasnt using Force Touch across all of its upcoming products. The pressure-sensitive input method allows for a deeper press to be detected as a secondary type of input vs. a standard one, which could open up a lot of options for a completely touch-based smartphone.The Force Touch trackpad on the new MacBook (and the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display) acts and feels like a normal, mechanical Mac trackpad, with a satisfying click when pressed, but in fact its , supplanting the downward motion with a very fine side-to-side haptic motor agitation that is impossible to register as anything else than a press. This allows you to press once for a normal click, and then press a second, deeper time following the first to access a secondary function or perform some other action, without having to right-click or open a menu.On an iPhone, you can see a lot of the potential benefits of using this kind of tech. It wold allow for new control capabilities for games, for instance, and could help make for much more sophisticated input response in apps like Garage Band, where being able to detect the difference between a light and a hard press could translate to different sounds produced by a virtual keyboard. Apple already kind of does this with Garage Band, but its a far less sensitive mechanism, which basically uses the iOS devices motion sensor to register big differences in tap pressure.Apple showed how Force Touch on new MacBook trackpads enables handwriting input with subtle pressure detection. That kind of input capability on an iPhone or iPad could also open up options for drawing, painting and other creative apps. There are now a number of Bluetooth stylus accessories that mimic pressure sensitivity in certain apps, but Force Touch could allow for more of that to be built into the hardware, and made available to developers at the system level.The WSJ report doesnt say if Apple will add the kind of clicky taptic feedback to the iPhone that it has used on the MacBook trackpad at the same time as it introduces pressure detection, but this might be the time for Apple to finally employ those kinds of haptic for things like keyboard clicks on its upcoming device. The taptic hardware is incredibly thing and space-conserving, and the response it provides almost cant be compared with traditional vibration motors used in haptic systems, in terms of how subtle and senses-baffling it performs in real life. Haptics have never seemed right for an iPhone, but tactics are a different story.As for other details on upcoming hardware, WSJ says new iPhones (likely coming in fall, as usual) will resemble the current ones in size options, but may actually add a pink (!) metallic aluminum case option, which is currently being tested. Id expect them to color match the finishes on the Apple Watch Edition before they went in that direction, but this could be another facet of their expanded attempts to offer greater personalization options.", "title": "Apple Pegged To Bring Force Touch Pressure-Sensitive Input To NextiPhones"},

Still in its infancy, the concept relies on thermal imaging cameras to track residual heat your body leaves on surfaces that it touches.Metaios software can track these heat signatures so they act as clicks or touches in Augmented Reality interfaces that only the user sees on interactive eyewear or devices. Its a pretty interesting concept and will undoubtedly open a new realm for User Experience and User Interface experts to ponder.The first prototype we looked at was crude and completely impracticalan iPad with a giant thermal camera attached to it. Indeed, a few people pointed out to me why would you need to touch external surfaces, when the iPad screen is right in front of you? However that question totally misses the point of the prototype, which was really just proving the concept was worth further exploration.This next concept forthermal touchthat Metaio is demoing at the Mobile World Congress this week is almost as crude as the former, but does breaksome new ground in that it is built to better emulate how the team envisions the tool working when it is finally productized: as a wearable system.Using the as part of their prototype, the team has been able to test howtheir software couldenable newinterfaceparadigmsforinteractive eyewear. This next prototypehuge as it may beis at least built into a wearable format. In this way, you can begin to see how this concept could work once interactive eyewear, as a category, reaches a form factor (um, were not there yet).Again, these are future concepts but I appreciate this approach because this feels like true R&D and Metaio have approached this in the classic way by employing small, nimble teams of researchers to conduct these types of experiments and think about the future. I think this is how you get new stuff created!Still, the concept is not totally bulletproof yet. Other problems arise like latent heat on various surfaces. Are there limitations? Sure, but innovation doesnt occur when creators focus on limitations. It occurs when creators focus on opportunities.Im anxious to see where this interface capability goes and how this could integrate with all the developments in interactive eyewear that are coming from the likes of Microsoft, Magic Leap and Meta.", "title": "Metaios Thermal Touch Gets A Little Bit Smaller At MWC2015"},

These include essential patents related to 2G and LTE tech, as well as non-standard patents dealing with software and component hardware design.With the ITC filing, Ericsson is seeking exclusion orders, or junctions, meaning it would want to have the sale of Apple devices barred pending resolution of their patent complaint. The U.S. District Court case is mainly about Ericsson attempting to recoup damages from Apple.The main issue here appears to center on licensing arrangements  Ericssons standards essential patents fall under FRAND terms, which means Ericsson must offer them to other companies under fair and reasonable non-discriminatory licensing terms. Apple and Ericsson had a global licensing agreement that expired last month. A renewed offer based on what Ericsson believes were FRAND terms was rejected, and the wireless pioneer also says an attempt to have the dispute resolved by a U.S. federal courts decision on what would constitute fair terms was also declined by Apple, leading to this legal action.Ericsson holds a portfolio of over 35,000 patents, and remains the largest individual holder of standards essential patents in the wireless industry. Its difficult to find a contemporary company in the wireless industry that doesnt have licensing agreements in place with Ericsson, but it looks like Appleprobably felt they could get better terms than what were being offered in this case.Appleprovided the following comment regarding the renewed court action, reiterating its statement from when Ericsson first filed suit in January:With tens of thousands of innovative employees, Apple has deep respect for intellectual property.

Its about to get a dose of home automation thanks to new firmware from . The company behind the clever (and attractive) routers just announced a new set of features that will better position its product in the marketplace.These home automation features are a natural fit for Almond routers since Securifi designed the router to be showcased in a home rather than stuffed in a closet like most routers. The latest router can even be hung on a wall.Securifi launched the original Almond router in 2012 and quickly followed it up with a new model in 2014. Then, earlier this year, the company pushed out another router that packs more of what made the first two special: It combines top-tier technical specs with a pretty face. And now it does home automation, too.The new home automation features work in an if that than this scheme. However, unlike the online service of IFTTT or SmartThings, the platform is ran locally on the router and does not require a connect to the Internet. The latest Almond router, the Almond+, is compatible with ZigBee and Z-Wave devices, effectively giving the router the ability to talk to thousands of different home automation modules. This includes everything from smartlocks to connected thermostats and the like. Between ZigBee and Z-Wave, a home owner can make a home automation system that will rival the Jetsons.Securifi is releasing its own connected outlets. The outlet keeps with the nut theme and is called Peanut.I found the system easy to configure through a smartphone app. The apps flow is logical and the setup nominal, which is what made the original Almond popular.This move into home automation is an ambitious plan for Securifi, but a smart move. So far no one from Nest to ADT to SmartThings have found the secret sauce. Securifi presents an interesting proposition by integrating the home automation hub directly into a router making it a powerful connection hub.", "title": "Securifi Adds Serious Home Automation To Its AlmondRouters"},

Depending on what you need to shoot, you might put your phone on a tripod for smoother shots, add a directional mic for better audio during interviews, or swap out lenses to capture wide-angle footage or to get better distance shots without hurting quality as with digital zoom. Every mount or thread uses a common photography standard, making it a great option for getting kids started with video using second-hand gear or for using your phone as an emergency on-shoot backup.You can also remove parts of the rig bysimply loosening some screws and sliding out complete segments in one go. So even thoughBeastGrips wide-angle lens can be adjusted to work with any size phone, you might want to swap it out entirely for your own third-party lenses. For instance, I found that using the BeastGrip to get the phone on a tripod and then using my own to be a great combination.Even if you dont have any gear to add to your phone, having the extra grip is fantastic for shooting anything with lots of motion or where you need to mess with settings. I did most of my testing using the app, and on the iPhone 6 Plus I could reach all of the on-screen controls without feeling like I was awkwardly balancing the phone on my contorted fingers as I normally do when shooting, and even pull off fancy pan-and-zoom moves using the zoom presets.Unless youre wearing cargo shorts, dont expect to pocket the Beastgrip. Its size unfortunately makes it impractical for everyday use  theres no way Id walk around with this thing on all the time. But if youve got a couple of hours where you know youre going to be taking a lot of photos and video, like going to a kids little league game or school play, its perfectly fine, better than finger-cradling your phone for that same amount of time.While the added grip and expandability are great for casual shoots, after a weekof use, I realized that I hadnt been careful enough while removing my phone from the clampthat keeps it in place.Each side of my leather case are now slightly torn  so if youre going to use the Beastgrip, be sure to only use a rubber phone case.Beastgrips rig is now available for , coming in at $70 for the main rig and $105 if you want the Depth of Field adapter and wide-angle lens. If youve already got an Olloclip or Moment lenses of your own, youre probably fine going with the cheaper option  unless you want another tool in your belt for changing the look of your footage.The Beastrip Pro seems best for those who already try to push their phones camera to its limits with apps and lenses. Youre not going to get DSLR-quality video from your phone by adding a rig and some extra tools, but youcan at least eliminate the shakiness and terrible audio endemic in video shot on mobile.In response to my iPhone case damage, Beastgrip founder Vadym Chalenko noted that hes totally aware about phones case scratching issue and this is not something that users would experience in finished version of Beastgrip Pro, even with leather case. We are in [the] process of improving rubber pads design and in addition there is an option to adjust the upper clamp to reduce compression power. So while it might be too late for my formerly-pristine case, those who pick up production models via the Kickstarter page shouldnt have to worry about damage  though Id still be careful with that clamp.", "title": "The Beastgrip Pro Turns Your Phone Into A Mobile VideoRig"},

The new proposed patent for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Delivery System (via ) contains some impressive revelations about Amazons proposed automated package transport plans.For instance, the system would use location information shared by a package recipients smartphone to be able to zero in on their position and bring deliveries directly to them, regardless of whether they happen to be at home or somewhere else. Youd also be able to specific different locations as package destinations, giving you more flexibility about where to receive things depending on your schedule or needs at the exact time of delivery.This would be a huge step up from the current situation in terms of convenience. At best, delivery services will call me the morning a package is set to arrive to provide a heads up, and let you modify your delivery day online. Being able to tweak it while the package is en route to match up with your exact plans hour-by-hour would take a lot of the unnecessary stress and worry out of the whole process.Amazons patent also includes details around how it will use sensors, cameras, radar and more to guarantee the drones can land safely, and how it will monitor its path to avoid humans and other obstructions. But the key magic here, in terms of how the system would present an improvement for consumers as well as giving Amazon benefits vs. current old-school delivery methods, is that intelligent, adaptable route-shifting.Of course, it also means Amazon will have to take extra precautions to ensure that its not easy for bad actors to manipulate drone routing to intercept packages.

Just like a tablet/smartphone combo was a common duo over the past few years, a smartwatch/phablet duo could be the optimal setup for working on-the-go in the future.The iPad and iPhone previously operated together as a way to both quickly and easily handle small tasks, but also to have a larger device on hand for taking care of more serious business, or for easier reading of longer content. Apples ability to create a tablet that people actually wanted to use probably cut the home PC out of the loop for a big chunk of users  and the market trends among the general PC OEM population over the past few years seems to back that up.Of course, no computing paradigm is permanent. The iPhone was perhaps the first proof for many that a lot of general computing could be handled without having to seek further than your pocket. The Apple Watch will likely offer a similar realization, and the way it changes how we look at our devices could result in a flip of position and popularity between iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models.While Apple doesnt reveal specific details on the iPhone 6/6 Plus sales mix when it announces iPhone numbers each quarter (or even split between the current generation and previous ones, for that matter), Apple CEO Tim Cook did say during the companys most recent earnings call that the during the last quarter. Id argue that the Apple Watch will be the bump needed to switch that around for the coming generation of new iPhone devices, because so much more can be done on the wrist, which affects the basic mechanics of carrying a large device in a big way.As it is, Im torn between the convenience of the smaller iPhone 6 and the big benefits of the larger display on the iPhone 6 Plus. But when the Apple Watch is added into the mix, the choice becomes much more clear. Even if the Watch only decreases the number of times you have to actually retrieve your iPhone from your bag or pocket by around 30 percent (and Im anticipating more than that based on early impressions and reports from longer-term testers), then that already mitigates some of the downsides of the larger device. Currently, my primary reason for going with the iPhone 6 is basically just that the 6 Plus works better as something carried in a bag or coat than a pants pocket. The pocket, however, is far easier to reach in most settings.So long as the Watch is sufficient for (while talking to others, for instance), my iPhone 6 Plus pains would be alleviated. And the combo then eliminates much of the benefit of carrying an iPad.As a result, I think its worth considering the Apple Watch as more of an iPad-like product line than as an iPhone accessory. If Apple can usher in a shift to a wearables/smartphone paradigm, the opportunity might be far greater than if it was just adding and additional device to the existing list of devices anyone uses on a daily basis.Thats not to say the iPad goes away, either; Id see it becoming even more of a PC or home computer replacement in this new arrangement, spending more time on the coffee table than in the bag. And that new vision has me excited  Ive given up on fantasies of going back to a more unplugged world, but Apple Watch could at least avoid those smartphone attention holes when a notification pulls you into a lengthy, distracted aimless browsing session.", "title": "How The Apple Watch And iPhone 6 Plus Might Flip Your Mobile ComputingHabits"},

He said it doubled. Paul Graham (@paulg) The Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel hardware refreshes were announced around two weeks prior to the Apple event in San Francisco, and the new Kickstarter campaign quickly rose to become the most-funded of all time. Currently, the campaign has racked up over $18 million in funding from over 71,000 backers, and there are still just under two weeks remaining in the campaign.A renewed spike in interest following Apples big announcement is no surprise  Apple has done more than any existing wearable company to raise the profile of wrist-based computing, and it was bound to help existing companies gain more notoriety in the public sphere. Pebble also benefits from catering to cross-platform device users, since it works with both Android and iPhone, so people just becoming interested in smartwatches might naturally be drawn to its campaign if they arent primarily an iPhone user. It was a bump Pebble definitely saw coming, too.Apples event this week caused a nice spike in support for us, as anticipated, Migicovsky told TechCrunch. When the biggest company in the world enters your market, thats the kind of validation you can only dream of. Ultimately the more awareness for smartwatches, and the more choice for consumers, the better for everyone. 2015 is going to be an extraordinarily exciting year.In the short term, Apples entry will definitely be a general boon to the wearable industry as a whole, but its unclear yet just how things will shake out for competing devices in the long run. Apple will stop selling some competing health-specific wearables in store, for instance, which is a blow to market awareness of those devices, but Pebble has the benefit of having a very dedicated audience with perhaps a more geeky bent than Apples ideal target market.", "title": "Pebble Time Kickstarter Drew 167% More Money Per Hour The Day After ApplesEvent"},

It will go on sale this summer.The company has also shown a prototypeeight-inch tablet device, which will be called the Blackphone+, which its lining up for a fall release. Development for this isstill at a relatively early stage, with an extended alpha beta program planned with partners to see what it is that they are interested in the tablet doing, as CTO Jon Callas puts it.Theres still a number of decisions that we have about where we can go on it. Like aspect ratio. Do we do 16:9, do we do 4:3, he tells TechCrunch in an interview.Blackphone hardware runs a hardened Android fork, called PrivatOS, so its also compatible with Android apps.SGP announced itwould be adding in itsown app store in an update due earlythis year  along with a featurecalled Spacesthat will let userssegmentactivity on theirdevice by creating multiplesecure spaces for particular apps, accounts or data to help balance security and usability.The original Blackphone project was marketedat prosumers with security concerns. But the Switzerland-based company behind it, SGP Technologies, is now thinking a lot bigger  flush with $80 million in external investment its taking in since last May. Its refocusing on selling security-focusedmobilehardware and encrypted comms software toenterprises, withprosumers now its secondary target. Call it a partial pivot, after enterprises liked what they saw with last years Blackphone and came calling.The prosumer market has been our primary market up until now but were making a huge push into enterprise, says Callas. Enterprise markets in Europe, South America, Middle East is where were going rather than what we started off with  which was the prosumer market. Theyre still very important to us and thats why were doing what were doing with Blackphone [hardware] but in an organization youre going to have a wide mix of devices.We know that we are not going to have a company buy only Blackphone devices. There are going to be people who are not going to give up their iPhones. There are going to be people who are going to want some sort of other Android phone, so were providing the communications ecosystem and infrastructure that works on any of those devices, he adds.Blackphone started out last Januaryasajoint venture between encryptedcomms company Silent Circle, which offers secure voice and messaging apps such as Silent Phone and Silent Text, and Spanish smartphone maker Geeksphone.But last week largely from new investors  and was spending some of that on buying out its joint-venture partner.Some of Geeksphones staff  including co-founder Javier Agera  aremoving over to the new wholly Silent Circle owned single, vertically integrated company, so its retaining mobile hardware expertise (with this ex-Geeksphone team based out of Madrid), even as it shifts focus to selling a mixed and integratedsuite of securehardware and software comms services to businesses.It makes it much easier on the company  it means theres one set of marketing, one set of sales, development and everything else is running together. Its huge savings for us, saysCallas of the consolidation. Bottom line, the project has proved more successful than the original partnersenvisaged  and the company now hasthe investment to think bigger, and restructure to focus onserving enterprise customers.Also today SGP announced a tablet-based secure audio conferencing system called Silent Meeting, again with enterprise users in mind. The encrypted software will also offer meeting control features such as visibility on whos dialed inand who hasnt  designed to make the most of the larger screen real estate of tablet hardware.Silent Meetingwill run on the forthcoming Blackphone+ tablet and also,as with all of SGPs comms apps, oniOS and Android hardware. So this is about Blackphoneriding thebring your own (BYOD) device trend which iscontinuing to remodel how enterprise IT is delivered.Were a communications company that has hardware and software and services. There are a lot of people who would like to have a privacy and security enhanced device like what were doing with Blackphone. But were also focusing on the communications aspect  because we are a secure voice, video, texting system as well that runs on any Android or iOS device, says Callas.We also have enterprise management software so that you can manage multiple accounts We have done a recent upgrade to our existing management software, well be doing more integration with enterprise tools, with corporate directories, with other things so that you provide cloud communications  thats primarily what weve been doing with Silent Circle  we have a cloud phone system that lets you do secure calls that are IP calls, and also we connect to the normal telephone system.Itwill also be working more with mobile device management (MDM) vendors and other enterprisetool makers so that we fit into the ecosystem that theyve got today, asCallas puts it.Is Blackphone seeking to reinventing Blackberry on a more consumer-friendly Android base? Callas resists the comparison, arguing that the enterprise space has moved on and needssecure comms solutions to match  i.e. which can flexibly integrate with mixed mobile estates, and support different types of device deployments.Blackberry was very much focused on email. Were focused on voice communications and texting primarily, he adds. The comparison between us and Blackberry has gone on a lot over the last year. And Blackberry themselves started it in many ways. I dont really think a lot about displacing Blackberry; I am looking at how I supply software and services that my customer needs.Im looking at what enterprises need in the next five years, not what they need in the last five years. Its a dramatically changed world from when Blackberry was the big player. And thats part of why theyre having problems now.There is still no Silent Mail product, of course, after Silent Circle, back in 2013, in the wake of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowdens revelations about intelligence agency surveillance  although Callas confirmed it is continuing to work with Lavabits Ladar Levison on the . In the meanwhile its focus is squarelyon securing the other bits of mobile comms, including text messaging.Mobile devices have been taking over from laptops and desktops by doing the sorts of things people do all the time very well. They do small things very well rather than the kitchen sink, says Callas.What were looking at the way that we do the business is to make it so that the sorts of communications tasks that people do all the time they would rather do with Silent Circle on our services and our devices better than anyone elses.As well as increased enterprise concerns on the security front, with data breaches and hacks continuing to hit the headlines every week, Callas also pointsto a costadvantage that its hoping will appeal to business users given Silent Phoneand Silent Text routevoice calls and SMS away fromcellular networks and viaencryptedVoIP.We are providing a combination of very low cost international calling, and completely secure calling using the Internet, notes Callas. The advantage of this is that it means that if you have something like the that weve heard about youre only using your phone for a TCP/IP or youre running it over Wi-Fi.

The crown on the side of the watch is actually a pusher and everything is set from your smartphone rather than by turning the crown. The internal battery lasts two years and syncs via Bluetooth. The modules are made by , the same company behind the motion trackers in Jawbones products.A separate app shows your health data as you saunter from meeting to meeting or nibble a madeleine.The central face tells the accurate, quartz time while the subface can display various pieces of data. In its current incarnation the system is basically an activity tracker similar to the . The functionality has been simplified so that companies are able to hide the complexity behind a traditional dial, a feature that should please Luddite watch lovers.But what about the rest of us? This solution is a far cry from the recharge-once-a-day smartphone expanders available for Android and iOS and the decision to avoid a on-wrist screen altogether is a bold one. As notes, The question MMT is trying to answer is how the traditional watch industry will react to timepieces no longer being about only tradition, luxury, and style, but also (once again), functionality.

However, these more expensive watches  expect them to cost in the $2,000 range or more  are a hard sell in the face of $200 activity wearables that the chic and traditional can hide under one French cuff while they burnish a mechanical watch with the other.Furthermore, companies like and are adding smart features to your band, allowing you to have your almond financier and eat it too.This space is exploding and the fact that a traditionally mechanical watchmaker is embracing the equivalent of a microchip attached to a big battery is telling. While MMT is decidedly not for everyone, I wouldnt discount interest just yet.

According to Microsoft, you can double the storage and RAM for $100. The Surface 3-designed Type Cover will still cost you $129, as with the Pro 3.The Surface 3 goes on pre-sale today, and it will be widely available for sale on May 5. That puts the devices first financial impacts in Microsofts fiscal fourth quarter, or the second calendar quarter of 2015.Materially, the devices are quite similar in look and feel. They share a shape, a form factor, nearly identical attachable keyboards, and pens. There are some differences, naturally, but the devices are clearly kin.For your enjoyment, heres a supplied photo of Surface 3:Surface 3And here is a photo TechCrunch took while reviewing the Surface Pro 3:Not Surface 3Too close to tell? Check the lack of bezel around the Surface 3s Type Cover, between the keys and the final edge of the product. Its thinner, to allow for a narrower cover to fit the smaller screen of the new Surface.Heres a supplied shot of the keyboard, which, reminds me a bit of the in how the keys stretch to the ends of the hardware:Also not Surface 3, but built for Surface 3. Not for Surface Pro 3.Microsoft built a smaller Surface Pro 3 so that it could sell the device at a lower price point. The Surface 3, at its base price point, is 62.4 percent of the cost of its predecessor. Laboring under the presumption that the average laptop consumer is price sensitive  marginally sensitive to negative dollars as a percentage price delta between two competing devices  the move makes sense.Microsoft declined to comment on what sort of margins it will derive from the Surface 3, and didnt laugh at my in-meeting joke concerning it drivingenough margin from the $129 Type Cover to cover other perhaps break-even devices. I kid, but keep in mind that Microsoft has plannedfor Surface to eventually be a profitable enterprise .In its most recent quarter, thecompany improving margins in its hardware work, citing increased Surface Pro 3 sales. It will be interesting to see how the Surface 3 itself shifts that language over the next few quarters.Moving past the Type Cover built for it, the Surface 3 has its own dock like the Pro 3, but, you guessed it, smaller.Microsoft has long had two Surface units on sale at any given point, formerly split between Pro and not-Pro models, the former running Intel processors a full build of Windows while the latter ran a variant of Windows that has since been left behind. Windows RT, that now pass variant, was torn between Windows desktop past, and its app-based future. But, as Windows was trying toan app platform, the device was premature and eventually doomed.The Surface 3 runs a full build of Windows, relieving it from the core flaw of its predecessor.That being said, for now I will register modest optimism in the Surface 3s commercial viability. Microsoft is accepting pre-orders from a larger, 26 market pool for the Surface 3. That wider release could help the company drive increased unit volume.Well go hands-on as soon as my hands are on one of the new gadgets.", "title": "Microsoft Announces Surface 3, A Cheaper, Thinner, Slower Surface Pro3"},

There are countless other tweets and comments with the same sentiment. Right now theres visceral hate directed at the company. A swathe of consumers feel betrayed by the stark design of the new MacBook. was shared over 25,000 times. Its a polarizing design.The new MacBook thinks different. It has more in common with a tablet than most laptops. Think of it as an iPad that has a keyboard and runs OS X. And like the iPad, it only has one port, which is the cause of the outcry.Most computers have several ports scattered around the frame. Theres usually one for charging, a couple USB ports for various tasks, and some sort of port to output video. The new MacBook combines all three into a single USB-C port. This means users will not be able to, say, charge the laptop and an iPhone at the same time or input data from a flash drive while outputting video to an external monitor. Sure youre going to have some nice accessories to do all these things down the line but this barebones approach is a pretty hard sell in a world where some laptops still have a serial port.This is Apples world and we just live in it.To Apples credit, the company must see a market for such a computer. The low-power Intel chipset that powers the computer likely doesnt provide enough oomph to play computer games but it should render GIFs just fine. This is a couch computer. Its a Facebook and Twitter machine. It even looks like a great programming computer. Watch the Apple event yesterday. The company didnt demonstrate any of its new software on the new MacBook including the Photos app. Simply put, the new MacBook isnt for photo editing. Its for Facebooking.Expectations are high for Apple. Had a company like HP or Lenovo released a watered-down computer like the new MacBook, there likely wouldnt have been an outcry, but rather a collective chuckle. For some reason, a swath of Apple fans expects the company to build every product to meet their needs. If it doesnt, feelings of betrayal sneak in. This happened with the original MacBook Air.Apple released the first MacBook Air in 2008. It cost $1,799 and, like the new MacBook, was a svelte wonder of technology. But it lacked ports. The industry criedfoul, pointing out that it only had a power port, a single USB port and a Micro-DVI port. It was missing a DVD-ROM and Ethernet port, a travesty in an era of burgeoning Wi-Fi and the slow decline of physical media. In 2008 this was a big deal. Software was still shipped on disks and Wi-Fi was hard to find. Apple fans felt betrayed. They felt forgotten. If a customer wanted Apples latest and greatest machine, they would have to buy into interacting with a computer without a CD drive or wired Internet.Eventually, Apple dropped Ethernet from its entire MacBook line and the MacBook Air is now the least expensive laptop Apple offers.The new MacBook joins the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Its not a replacement for either  at least not yet. Butit bears a nameplate previously retired: MacBook. Its not an Air, its not a Pro. Its just a MacBook, which was long the companys stalwart, low-cost machine against the rising tide of Microsoft Windows.Its highly likely that in a generation or two that Apple will drop the price of the MacBook to under a thousand. Will the MacBook Air survive? Maybe not. Apple is steadily making the MacBook Pro smaller. Its easy to see a future where the MacBook will be the companys only inexpensive laptop and a slightly slimmer MacBook Pro will be the other option if you want silly things like multiple USB ports, SD card slots and a MagSafe power adapter.Until then, a 13-inch MacBook Air is a better buy than the new MacBook. The battery lasts nearly as long, the computer is more powerful and it has plenty of ports. Plus, nobody has ever said that they wished their MacBook Air was just a bit thinner. But maybe, soon, they will.", "title": "Apples Latest Betrayal"},

The same story played out with the iPad.But the Apple Watch enter the market with variation as it is a .As opposed to a phone or a tablet, where whats inside matters most, the Apple Watch is invariably a fashion product just as much as it is a computing tool. While the iconic and uniform look of the watch face itself will act as a status symbol in its own right, no one wants to wear the exact same thing as everyone else. A watch is inherently an accessory, and accessories are made to set us apart.But this is only a good thing for Apple, which has spent years developing this technology and to merge the worlds of technology and fashion in a way that is enticing to consumers. And with that patience comes a far-reaching product that offers the same breadth as Apples most popular product, the iPhone.In fact, Apple has positioned itself to make even more money off of the diversity of this product. Due to the special band connector developed by Apple, swapping out a leather strap for a Sport strap or any one of Apples many color/material options should be a generally recurring activity, much like we treat iPhone cases.", "title": "The Apple Watch Will Cost Between $349 And $10K+, Pre-Orders Start April10"},

More battery life, perhaps?The reason I ask is that the Apple Watch has a port that the company has yet to show off. Its being used for diagnostics and direct access to the Watch operating system, but its feasible that could be used to connect accessories in the future.The port has a 6-dot brass contact array inside the groove for the bottom strap connector slot. Several sources have confirmed its existence and placement to me. It is very similar to the connector for the Lightning connector in iPhones, as that connector currently only uses 6 of its 8 available pins. Apple recently for use by third parties.A source says that this port is currently for diagnostic purposes only  but that there is nothing preventing it from being a connection port for future accessories.Lets get this out of the way: As far as I know, smart bands will be a part of the first Apple Watch version.But the existence of the port is interesting. Every millimeter of the Watch has been decided with purpose in mind. In a device so small and personal, you cannot afford to keep anything extraneous. Apple including this kind of port on what I believe to be the shipping versions of the Apple Watch means that its absolutely necessaryin order to install the OS during manufacturing. Or fortesting or debugging purposes  say, in an Apple Store. But that doesnt preclude the possibility that it could be used to connect accessories in the future.Those accessories would likely take the form of bands that expanded the capabilities of the Watch in some way. One obvious way would be to include additional sensors in a band to gather more information about the wearer in health capacities. This could be a way to add sensors that measured stress, blood pressure and more  things the current version does not track.Its also conceivable that a company like Mophie could build a Watch band that contained an additional battery for extended life (if Apple extends band manufacturing to other companies, which seems likely).Pebble a feature for its new Time watch called Smartstraps, which operates on the same principle.This first wave of the Apple Watch will be about seeing what developers can get it to do with apps. But, as weve seen with the iPhone, of Apple retail. Having accessories that not only augment the Watch aesthetically, but also operationally, would be big business.This kind of extensibility would be a great way to get around the I just bought a watch for a couple thousand dollars that will be obsolete next year problem. What if people that shelled out thousands could add additional capabilities by simply upgrading their bands? This wouldnt help if most of the money you spent was on your hardened gold link band, of course, but it could alleviate the angst over having to replace a hefty investment down the road.While the port is on watches that are being used by Apple employees currently  there is always a possibility that the Watch version that ships to consumers wont have this port at all (the Watchs design has changed in small ways over the months since its announcement). There is also absolutely no guarantee that the port will ever be used for anything but diagnostics. But its still interesting that it exists  and to think about the possibilities.If youre curious, the other slot has Assembled in China  Designed by Apple in California engraved inside.:Apple declined to comment on rumor or speculation.This report was apparently referring to a Lightning port. The diagnostic port we mentioned above is both on Apples watches at the event (we checked) and in their videos released on the construction process.", "title": "Would You Buy A Smart Band For An AppleWatch?"},

The cash will be used to ramp up production of the firms upcoming consumer drone along with increasing development of its commercial products in .Anderson stated working with Qualcomm was a natural fit for 3D Robotics. The company designed its drones much like an Android cell phone. There are different so-called stacks to the hardware. Some of these stacks, like on Android, can be modified by the owner while others are locked. Since Qualcomm chips run most Android smartphones, the companys chips fit well into 3D Robotics design scheme.Plus the two companies are practically neighbors.3D Robotics is based in Berkeley, California, but operate engineering facilities in San Diego, Qualcomms hometown. The drone makers manufacturing facility is just five minutes away across the border in Tijuana, Mexico. Company employees even has special boarder passes so they dont have to stop at Customs.3D Robotics plans to implement Qualcomm technologies in upcoming drones including the chip makers popular Snapdragon SoC. 3D Robotics consumer drone will use Qualcomm chips; none of the companys current products use Qualcomm parts, though.Along with Qualcomm Ventures, Foundry Group, True Ventures, OATV, Mayfield, Shea Ventures and additional investors also participated. This latest round is the largest single funding round of any U.S-based drone manufacturer to date, bringing 3D Robotics total amount raised to $85 million from three rounds and eight investors.True Ventures was the first investor in 3D Robotics when the company launched in 2012, Jon Callaghan, founder of True Ventures, said to TechCrunch. We shared Chris Andersons vision for the future of robotics and autonomous vehicles. 3DR is leading this next wave of the manufacturing revolution, using software, open source and networks to empower the hardware of tomorrow. We are thrilled to be a part of the 3DR team.Anderson laughed when I pointed out that the form 3D Robotics filed with the SEC showed the company set out to raise $40 million but ended up with $50 million.

Perceptiv Labs, a YC Winter 2015 cohort startup with a founding team out of Waterloos top-flight robotics engineering department, is offering high-flying drone hobbyists, filmmakers and journalists a relatively affordable, yet advanced way to introduce some highly intelligent automation into their video-making antics right now.Perceptiv, which also has funding from Version One Ventures, is via pre-order campaign, a $600 accessory (which will retail post-campaign for $800) that works with the DJI Phantom and 3D Robotics Iris, providing a vision sensor, processor and autopilot program for capturing amazing aerial shots via subject tracking. Essentially, it turns these hobbyist drones into robotic flying dollies for capturing great pans, zooms and fly-by shots, with computer vision tech making sure to keep a user-defined subject exactly where it needs to be in the frame along the way.As a startup, Perceptiv is targeting a much larger opportunity that includes much more ambitious advances in computer vision and autonomous device operation. Co-founder Neil Mathew explained in an interview the broader vision for his company.The end goal is to build the infrastructure of vision-based intelligence for drones that will let them navigate independently in unknown spaces, avoid collisions with obstacles, and be able to track and detect objects, he said. [We want them to] understand a scene, and intelligently respond to instructions as opposed to just being able to fly manually.Its not a unique goal  other companies, including large industry heavyweights like Qualcomm and Intel, are also very interested in research projects related specifically to computer vision and autonomous vehicles. Nvidia also showed off a number of collision avoidance models that incorporate computer vision and advanced object detection at CES this year. But Mathew explained that where Perceptiv differs from many of these other companies is that theyve actually launched a product, rather than just announcing research programs.SHIFT is that product, and its designed to offer a very real, immediately tangible impact for a specific audience right now, rather than the promise of something cool coming five or ten years down the road.Our product is something that will let professional filmmakers take really beautiful precise shots with drones, without two years of piloting experience, he said. Its relatively easy to fly a drone up high and get a simple shot, but being able to take some sort of complex maneuver with a drone where youre tracking a subject of interest, it becomes really difficult to fly a drone as well as control camera angles at the same time.SHIFT is available either as an aftermarket add-on, or pre-installed on either the DJI Phantom or 3DR Iris+. The pre-installed packages still cost under $2000, and the shipping date Perceptiv is targeting is this fall for all of the above. Compared to the going rate for many more complicated aerial photography solutions, these are remarkably inexpensive, and if you take a look at the example footage from the videos provided by Perceptiv, the end results are certainly impressive.", "title": "Perceptivs SHIFT Turns Drones Into Smart Dollies ForFilmmakers"},

Apple now says that permanent and temporary changes to your skin, including the ink used in tattoos, can impact the heart rate sensors performance.In addition, the document clarifies, the ink, pattern and saturation of the tattoo can block the light from the sensor, making it difficult for Apple Watch wearers to get reliable readings. That is to say, those with darker tattoos that cover more of the skins surface may have more issues than those with lighter tattoos that are smaller in size.Theparagraph on tattooswas added to a page detailing how the Apple Watch heart rate sensor works, in a section that explains what sorts of factors could affect the sensors performance and a wearers ability to get a good reading. The Internet Archive, which keeps historical copies of websites, shows that of this same page didnt include the note about tattoos, ahead of the Apple Watchs launch in April.That implies that Apple learned of the issues from user feedback, as Watch owners began to call in to report problems with their device. Some users even posted to demonstrating the problem first-hand, which were picked up by the media.Its not all that surprising that a wrist tattoo could impact the effectiveness of the Apple Watchs light sensor. The sensor allows an Apple Watch owner to wear the device looser on the wrist  snug but comfortable, says Apple  and still get a good reading. Explains Apple:Apple Watch uses green LED lights paired with lightsensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through your wrist at any given moment. When your heart beats, the blood flow in your wrist  and the green light absorption  is greater. Between beats, its less. By flashing its LED lights hundreds of times per second, Apple Watch can calculate the number of times the heart beats each minute  your heart rate.This type of technology has been known to cause problems in the past. For example, a reddit user several months ago that they had a problem getting a good reading using the Fitbit HR heart monitor.

How much computer, after all, can you expect to get for $149? Ive now had a chance to spend a few days with the Hisense Chromebook and the answer is: more than you probably expect.Its a bit of a shock going from a Chromebook Pixel (or any $1,000 laptop) to the plasticky Hisense, but then you wouldnt expect an aluminum body with high-end finishes at this point. Hisense dampens that effect a little bit by making the wrist rest from metal, which makes the laptop actually feels pretty sturdy.The real letdown, however, is the screen. If you look at it from exactly the right angle, its not that bad, but deviate only a few degrees in any direction and things go downhill quickly. Sadly, thats still pretty much standard for low-end laptops and given the $149 price, its not really a surprise (but still a shame) that this holds true for the Hisense Chromebook, too.Overall, thedisplay felt dark, too, unless I cranked up thebrightness all the way. The spec sheet says the display pumps out a maximum of about 200 nits of brightness and thats simply not a lot and definitely makes working outside in the sun very hard.Hisense promises about eight-and-a-half hours of battery life, which is probably achievable if you keep the brightness down. To actually work with the laptop, though, I had to keep it at about 75 percent brightness and to enjoy working with it, I had to bring it up to at least 90 percent. That brought down my real-world battery life while writing this review closer to six-and-a-half hours, which isnt bad, but having to crank up the brightness negates at least some of the power savings you get from the Rockchip CPU.In terms of speed, things are better than I expected. The Hisense happily handles 1080p video and complex WegGL sites like . On Googles Octane benchmark, the laptop scores about 6,700 points and on Mozillas Kraken benchmark, it clocks in at . That putsit on the , but benchmarks only tells a small part of the story. In daily use, Chrome OS pretty much always feels snappy enough. Rendering a complex page isnt quite instantaneous, but the user experience never feels like its slowing you down, even with about 25 tabs open.The chiclet keyboard, too, is better than I expected. Like the rest of the device, it feels solid enough with just enough feedback so you know youve clicked a button. Same goes for the trackpad, which is precise and never acted up during my test.To get to the $150 price range, device manufacturers have to cut some corners. Your typical Chromebook costs closer to $250, after all. Going with the Rockchip design means you dont get blasting performance, but its not as much of a trade-off as youd expect. I would happily pay a little bit more for a better display, however, but then you quickly end up in that $200 to $250 range and there are plenty of Chromebooks to choose from there already.Its important to keep in mind that Hisense (and Haier) arent necessarily targeting the U.S. market with these devices.While these are perfectly fine Chromebooks for students, for example, the real target for these are emerging markets like India, Thailand or Mexico. There, the low price point can mean the difference between being able to afford a laptop or not for many.If youre in the market for a $149 Chrome OS laptop (and are aware of all the drawbacks that implies both on the hardware and OS side), its worth giving the Hisense a try. If you dont mind spending $20 more, it may be worth waiting a few weeks for the $169 Asus C201, though. It uses the same Rockchip design and promises 13 hours of battery life. We havent seen its screen in action, though (nor that on the $149 Haier, to be fair).I could see myself carrying one of these while Im traveling. It feels solid enough and its good enough for browsing the web and writing a few emails. It has two USB plugs and an SD card reader, so you could easily use it to upload images and charge your phone. At $149, you dont have to worry all that much about breaking it or somebody stealing it either.", "title": "Hands-On With The $149 HisenseChromebook"},

The DroneDeploy platform autonomously pilots the drone for the user so they dont have to learn how to do it themselves.As well as doing the mapping, DroneDeployscloud platform also takes care of the data processing to speed up the entire operation delivering processed data back to the user in real-time and in an easily shareable format so they can act on the drone-delivered intel, rather than having to wrangle with the techitself.Thats kind of the dirty secret of drones, says co-founder and CEO Mike Winn. People say Ive got this amazing flying machine, its got four rotors, and it flies, and its cool and look it can product a 3D model, or it can produce a growth map of your fields  but no one talks about that space in between. How do you get that drone to actually make that growth map of your fields? It takes 50 to 70 clicks. Most of the time you must have a Windows laptop. You need to buy $8,000 pieces of software. Its going to take 24 hours of processing time to actually make those images into the map that youre looking for.We hide all that complexity. You just take out your mobile phone, you turn on your drone, you press two buttons on your phone, the drone will launch itll capture the imagery, itll process that imagery and itll deliver you back that imagery, that map or that 3D model in a matter of minutes.The core feature offered by DroneDeploy at this point is tailored to its current customer focus of farmers, construction companies and mining companies: namelyaerial imagery used forphotogrammetry. So it can offer mapping and 3D modeling of large areas (of hundreds of acres) andprovide volumetric estimates.More features will come down the line. Were just at the beginning, says Winn. Now we can get a drone to go and fly and create data autonomously. And we can do it in the way that anyone can do it. The next step is to start processing that data and going one level deeper wherewe can automatically detect change.[In future] we can tell construction sites whats happened in a day. We can start to do things like automatically tell rail companies theres an obstruction in the path of the railway line. So right now weve started on the first thing, which is giving the data, but theres so much more that we can do. And because all of the software that weve created is in the cloud it gives us infinite resources to be able to process that and do some really exciting computer science to figure out whats happening, whats changing in the world and how do we help businesses with this data.DroneDeploys SaaS product starts at $99 per month, and is just exiting beta now (initially focused on the U.S. market)  as the startupannounces a $9 million Series A round, led by Emergence Capital. Ithad previously raised a $2 million seed, including from SoftTech, Data Collective and AngelPad. Those priorinvestors are participating in its Series A. While Emergence Capitalgeneral partner Kevin Spain is also joinings board.Also today,itsannouncing a partnership with drone maker DJI, which Winn says opens up the market in a huge way for its SaaS platform. He estimates DJI has between 60% and 70% drone marketshare. Other drones are supported, including3DR drones  up to10% marketshare in his estimate. So we have by far the majority of the market being able to use our products, he adds.The majority of DroneDeploys beta customers thus far have been farmers. They can get value out of this immediately, says Winn, noting that thousands of aces of corn does not make forthe easiest terrain to monitor on foot.How do they know whats going on? Now they can just fly a drone over and theyve very quickly able to establish whats going on. They might have had hail damage from rain, or some disease or infestation cropping up. For the first time they can actually run these flights daily if they want to. Get this data immediately and start taking action.Drones can even be used to judgecrop health by monitoring how fast plants are growing  using infrared cameras.What will the startupbe using the new funding for? Scaling up to meet what it hopes will be strongdemand from a range of industries, says Winn, and also starting to build out those additional powerful features atop the data itscollecting to take the SaaS platform to the next level (as it were).As DroneDeploy launches out of beta, drone and satellite related investments are generallyon an uptick  as youd expect for what remains a relatively nascent space, outside military use-cases  running at$188 million across 22 venture rounds for this year so far, according to CrunchBase data. Last year the category pulled in $153 million in total in 63 venture rounds.", "title": "DroneDeploy Snags $9M As Its Drone Control Platform Soars Out OfBeta"},

For Apple, a key convenience addition came to the iPhone (and iPad, later) thanks to Touch ID, which allows unlock via a simple long touch with the thumb on the home button. This greatly enhanced device security overall largely because it encouraged people who werent using a PIN to set one up, since it lowered the friction required for the unlock process immensely.Androids series of trust flags, introduced in Lollipop, have a similar intent, albeit with a very different approach to the problem. For Google, using a hardware component like a fingerprint scanner is less viable in terms of introducing a core software component to handle this, because it serves hardware from a number of OEMs, and only a small percentage of those even employ fingerprint sensors, and those that do dont use a common standard.The various options now available dont require any special hardware (they use a devices camera, Bluetooth radio, GPS, and accelerometer) and can be enabled in any number of combinations based on a users preference and comfort level. You could activate Trusted Devices and not On-Body Detection, for instance, or just Trusted Places, or Trusted Places and Trusted Devices and On-Body Detection, and so on.On-body detection isnt fool-proof  quickly handing your phone to someone else is not going to be enough to break the unlock and require the PIN once again, for instance. But its a good step in making devices more situation-aware in terms of their level of security, and agains, is designed primarily as a convenience feature thats likely aimed more at getting people who normally abstain from such measures using more security features like passcodes.If its like Googles other Trusted services, it might not work as consistently as Id necessarily like, but its a very cool little trick to enable using only software and existing sensors in mobile devices.

During a rapid-fire demo session, I was able to see eight different startups and four really struck me as doing some novel work.The first up was called . The process theyve created enables people to draw and print their own circuit boards using pens and inkjet printers and a special silver ink.The news at SXSW is that AgIC printable circuit boards can now be large format. According to Massaki Sugimoto, who demoed the unit for me, these printable circuit boards can be as large as a wall in your home or similar surface.Additionally, AgIC have created a small hardware controller to which you can run your printed circuits and program to actuate other electronics. In this way, the circuits you create can also act as simple buttons for controlling other electronics. For example one circuit could turn on lights another could turn on your stereo and so on.This interests me as much from a visual standpoint as it does from an electronic one; there was something beautiful about how the circuit looked when printed out and Massaki even describe them as potentially being designed as wallpaper.A second startup I interviewed in the motel was called . SenSprout was founded by Kazuhiro Nishioka, Kazuhito Mine, Ryutaro Okada and Yoshihiro Kawahara.SenSprout actually uses AgICs process to create printable moisture sensors for plants. The concept is that you would just print out as many as you need at lower cost than traditional manufacturing. when this was still a research proof of concept, but the group incorporated about twomonths ago and are now in the process ofproductizing SenSprout.Whats most uniqueabout SenSprouts sensors is that they require no batteries to operate. They are able to take radio frequencies in the air (TV, cellular, radio) and convert those waves intothe tiny amount of energy they need to operate. An accompanying app can visually display the results that the sensor is tracking. Rad.Next, a company called led by Gentu Kondo, Hiroshi Yamaura, Tetsuya Konishi and evangelized by Akira Morikawa is planning to make prosthetic devices that are stylish, futuristic, that you can print at home on a 3D printer and that are in the $300 price range. Their goal is to make prosthetics available to everyone who needs one. They noted to me that, in Japan, only one percent of people in need of prosthetics currently have access to them due to the expense in acquiring them.The demo unit worn by Akira, who had lost part of his right arm, is capable or grasping items weighing up to 500grams and can even support additional attachments like cameras.The last concept in my rapid-fire session was . Led by Natsuo Akazawa, Atsuhiko Tomita, and Takehisa Ito, the stated goal of this company is to better educate people of the value that robotics can bring to humans and help them better recognize their value as a tool.To meet this goal, they created their own type of small robot kits that allow you to print most of the parts yourself. You order the motors and then print the other parts and assemble. You can also just order them fully assembled, but, the concept of a self-printable robot is most interesting to me. The friendly little robots are controlled via smartphone or tablet and dance, walk and even drive little automobiles.", "title": "Four Japanese Startups Visit Me At The Bates Motel During SXSW2015"},

Dedicated watch app site has spent considerable time and effort providing interactive teaser trailers that provide a basic idea how apps for Apple Watch will work in practice, however, and you can find a collection of those embedded below that include all the third- and some of the first-party apps Apple has featured both at Mondays show, and at the iPhone launch event last September where the Apple Watch was first introduced to the world.The Facebook-owned photo sharing app was one of the pieces of software that Apple had running on demo units at Mondays hands on showcase, and it provides a full image feed for casual browsing without a need to pull your phone out of your pocket. The app works pretty much like youd expect, but theres a second level view for seeing likes and interactivity options, making it mostly a browsing experience.Starwood is one of the partners that helps Apple showcase some of the more futuristic powers made possible by the Watch. The app from the hotelier allows guests to check in, and to unlock their hotel room door remotely in select locations. Increasingly, I think well see people use the Watch as a device that can interact widely with its surroundings, and this is a good initial example of that kind of thing.Uber has become an essential launch app in the way that Facebook and Twitter have been on mobile platforms in the past. The hailing app is a perfect fit for a wearable, as evidenced by the fact that it was also one of the premier pieces of software offered on Android Wear.This is part of Apples growing efforts to market directly to its expanding Asian customer base, since WeChat is among the fastest growing mobile chat apps in China and India. On the wrist, it offers a great way to quickly communicate, as well as send WeChats signature stickers.Apple Watch has a strong connected home angle, and the Alarm.com app provides a way to monitor home status, both for piece of mind and for remote control. This app was part of yesterdays stage show, too.A Twitter app is one of those things a platform needs to be taken seriously these days, and Apples demo reveals its among the more full-featured experiences, giving you access to much of the mobile apps functionality on your wrist. A timeline is basically perfectly suited to a small screen with a scroll wheel, after all.The official Maps app offers directions and navigation on the wrist, with a mini-map view that provides just enough context to help you get around in unfamiliar settings without having to hold out your phone while you wander.The native Photos app on the Apple Watch has a navigation system and general UX thats in keeping with the experience both on your iPhone and iPad, and now on the desktop via the upcoming Photos app. Apples Watch screen is actually surprisingly well suited to pictures, despite its small size.The Facebook app is another one that makes perfect sense on the wrist, given that a lot of FB interaction on smartphones probably comes via notifications these days. If were lucky, FB on the wrist will mean less time spent falling into Facebook holes so to speak, where you open the app to address something specific and then end up aimlessly browsing, without any memory of why you dove in to begin with.These are just a few of the apps announced or previewed so far, and has over 60 in total to check out, so be sure to head over there and try out some others if youre after a deeper look at what Apple Watch will be like from a software perspective.", "title": "Try These Interactive Demos Of Apple Watch Apps Featured At ApplesEvents"},

The new proposed patent for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Delivery System (via ) contains some impressive revelations about Amazons proposed automated package transport plans.For instance, the system would use location information shared by a package recipients smartphone to be able to zero in on their position and bring deliveries directly to them, regardless of whether they happen to be at home or somewhere else. Youd also be able to specific different locations as package destinations, giving you more flexibility about where to receive things depending on your schedule or needs at the exact time of delivery.This would be a huge step up from the current situation in terms of convenience. At best, delivery services will call me the morning a package is set to arrive to provide a heads up, and let you modify your delivery day online. Being able to tweak it while the package is en route to match up with your exact plans hour-by-hour would take a lot of the unnecessary stress and worry out of the whole process.Amazons patent also includes details around how it will use sensors, cameras, radar and more to guarantee the drones can land safely, and how it will monitor its path to avoid humans and other obstructions. But the key magic here, in terms of how the system would present an improvement for consumers as well as giving Amazon benefits vs. current old-school delivery methods, is that intelligent, adaptable route-shifting.Of course, it also means Amazon will have to take extra precautions to ensure that its not easy for bad actors to manipulate drone routing to intercept packages.

Co-founder and CEO Max Haot told me the Broadcaster is a good entry point, allowing you to just buy a prosumer camera and start streaming.The upcoming Broadcaster Pro will replace the existing device, while the Broadcaster Mini is smaller and cheaper  about one-third the size of the original (its 73mm by 51mm by 25.5mm, if you want to be exact), and only costs $295, compared to the original Broadcasters price of $495. At the same time, it can still stream 1080p video.Haot demonstrated the Mini for me last week, connecting it to a camera through an HDMI cable, then using the companys free iOS app (also available on Android) as a remote control to find an Internet connection and set up a stream of our interview. Now sure, watching an interview as you conduct it probably isnt the real use case (for one thing its a little distracting), but it was certainly impressive to see the nearly zero lag between the real-world discussion and the online stream.Haot also told me that the Broadcaster is currently used by around 40 percent of Livestreams active customer base. He said the company doesnt view the hardware as a big moneymaker  its real business lies in offering additional features like analytics and embedding.And while live-streaming video may not be the shiny new thing anymore (at least, not ), Livestream says it still streams 300,000 events to 40 million viewers each month.Haot said the company achieves that by offering the right tool for the right job. So even if you dont have a separate camera, you can live-stream from your computer or mobile device using one of the companys apps, or you can do something a little more professional with the Broadcaster Pro or Mini, or you can go even further upstream with a custom setup.We have a very robust roadmap of products, he added.

The Israeli company is a key patent-holder for digital stylus and writing recognition tech, as well as the supplier behind the pen input technologies used by both Microsoft and many of its OEM partners. So this brings in-house one of the technologies that Microsoft has used as a marquee feature, as its desktop OS gains support for devices like tablets and convertibles.The N-trig tech in the current versions of both Surface Pro 3 and Surface 3 replaced Wacom as a supplier, which handled digital pen input for the Surface Pro 2 and earlier generations. The switch initially caused some apprehension among creative pros whod grown used to using Surfaces digital drawing capabilities in their workflows, but digital art performance in the end was generally seen to be either on par with, or even improved, versus earlier models.In an official blog post, Microsoft outlined part of the logic behind its acquisition as follows:We cant wait to show you what well deliver for our Surface Fans in the future. Digital pens have a ways to go to be as good as pen and paper on some dimensions, and well get there. But more importantly, adding the ability to capture and share the work you do with a digital pen opens up possibilities that traditional pen and paper just cant match. Todays investment is another step that will let us push that innovation forward.Im a big fan of what the Surface Pro 3 can do with apps like Adobes Creative Suite and Autodesks SketchBook, thanks in large part to its digital pen tech. Microsoft bringing that in-house helps it keep a key advantage close to its chest, even if that tech mostly appeals to the niche creative audience for now (handwriting recognition and transcription still has some timebefore it becomes generally useful).It also could help set the stage for a coming clash surrounding more advanced input for touch-based devices: Apples new Force Touch and Taptic tech strongly suggest that it will bring additional pressure-sensitive input options to future iOS devices, and rumors from earlier this year indicate Apple could be adding an advanced stylus to its roster for a forthcoming iPad Pro device.The N-trig acquisition was originally reported back in February, with a (price has not been officially disclosed), but Microsofts acquisition today is of the pen tech specifically and related assets, not the company as a whole.", "title": "Microsoft Acquires Surface 3 Pen Tech FromN-trig"},

Droplet is also positioning itself as aconsumer devicefrom the get-go, vs the b2b focus of anotherwireless button startup,.Droplet helps users manage any and all tasks, whether its reminding, tracking, or automating internet actions, says co-founder Sohan Japa, when asked how it compares with Amazons staplereorderingbutton. Unlike the Dash, each Droplet is highly configurable and can be assigned for many roles. Whether it is to trigger an SMS to a loved one or tracking work hours into a spreadsheet, Droplet can be tailored to the individual and its actions can be changed at any time.He says theDroplet button is alsosmaller than Dash, and designed to be discreet and portable  with the team suggesting use-cases such as attaching it tomedicine and supplementbottles and caps as a reminder for taking pills, or lettings others know youve taken your pills.Why is a hardware button reminder better than just using a reminder app? Because these custom notifications can only be dismissed by going to the physical location and pushing the button itself. Ergo, youre morelikely to actually complete the task, rather than just dismissing the notification (or thats the theory).Other ideas for Droplet are as chore reminders to do stuff like take out the trash, water the planets, or feed the fish. Or for tracking exercise activity (although really a wearable seems a lot better placed for that). Or tracking personal hygiene regimes. And so on.Whatever forgetful tasks or quantifiable activities you think it would be useful to stick a tracking button on to keep tabs on  albeit the price per Droplet (which starts at $39 per button) will probably curb your enthusiasm somewhat. Each Dropletalso has a limited lifespan of around a year; once the battery expires so too does the button. Natch.The Bluetooth button requires a plug-in hub that hooks into your home Wi-Fi, and sucksup all your button-baseddata to Droplets cloud servers (so this is not a scenario privacy-conscious types will welcome), and has a companion iOS or Android app where you can configure the content and type ofnotifications (email, text, call etc) you want from each Droplet, and how often itshould ping you. The appwill also offer data visualizationof your usage and routines in graph form.The San Francisco-based startup, which was founded back in 2013,islaunching Droplet on today to try to raise$80,000incrowdfundingfrom people willingto expand the quantity ofnotifications in their life (via the promise of greater utility)andturn their current (working) prototype into a shipping product, starting in December.Droplet isnot the teams first startup. Japa was last May. While his co-founder Joshua Newth previously worked at a medical device startup, Cardica. The team is advised byLex Bayer, whois also a seed investor.

The Hue Go has a single button that offers local control over light tone and dynamic effects, as well as a low power standby mode and auto dimming to maximize usage on the go.The Hue Go resembles some of Philips existing efforts to create companion accent lights separate from its connected bulbs, like the LivingColors Iris and Bloom, but with the unique feature of a built-in battery. Its a semi-spherical gadget encased in translucent hard plastic, capable of outputting light of any color just like the primary Hue bulbs, as well as a range of white tones. The portability aspect offers freedom from fixed installation points, however.In practice, the Hue Go is a useful utility light for any scenario where you need a moderate amount of omnidirectional lighting. Its very handy for exploring deep closet corners, for instance, or for providing a bit of patio lighting that marries a nice ambiance with decent visibility. It also has the ability to act as a gradual wake-up light when plugged in on a bedside table, mimicking a gradual sunrise with alarm functions programmed through the Hue app.The Hue Go can output at up to 300 lumens when plugged in, but cuts it to 40 percent brightness when used unplugged to maximums battery, which gives you a pleasing but dim kind of ambient lighting. Overall, its plenty bright for most cases where youd be using a portable lighting solution anyway, especially given that this isnt a work light designed for the workshop, for instance. Its also compatible with third-party Hue apps, and can be included in any scenes you program using your Hue app and existing Hue system.Itll retail for $99.95 when it goes on sale at Apple Stores, Best Buy and Amazon in the U.S. by the end of May or the beginning of June, which is a good deal considering the cost of standalone sunrise simulation wake-up lights. A $100 bowl of light may not be at the top of everyones needs list, but it could definitely prove a useful addition to existing Hue setups.", "title": "Philips Hue Go Offers Smart Lighting Without TheCord"},

But going to get your vision tested can be time-consuming and annoying. And to make matters worse, optometrists spend about an hour per patient doing routine steps to collect information for a vision test when they could be helping patients with actual health issues., a company formed out of the MIT Media Lab, is looking to change all that.The company started with a 3D-printed smartphone add-on for measuring eyes for glasses, but the product has since evolved to provide all the service and equipment necessary to offer a full vision test, on demand.Through the app and various pieces of equipment (all of which can fit into a tiny suitcase), Blink offers users the option to order a vision test direct to their home. According to the founders, the Blink option acts as a mobile substitute for $20,000 worth of immobile equipment used in an optometrists office.A visioneer (as they call it) visits the house, sets up a little eye chart on a wall, and starts asking a few basic questions about your current prescription, how often you wear glasses or contacts, and if you have any history of health problems with your eyes. Then, with the help of a tablet app and a view-finder device, the user takes a series of easy tests that measure vision.The device is called the Netra, and aside from the smartphone used as a display, the whole thing is mechanical so that it doesnt ever run out of battery. It is highly reminiscent of the Samsung Gear VR, but instead of virtual reality games, the software is all about testing your vision. The visioneer then pairs the information garnered from the tests with data gathered from the users ability to read the eye chart.From there, the visioneer moves on to a new device called the Netropter, which lets you try out the suggested prescription by reading the eye chart again, replacing the painful process of deciding between one or two, two or three, one or three? as you would at the eye doctors office.Blink is very clear about the fact that this is not a substitution for an optometrist visit, but rather an easier way to get a glasses prescription.Its a vision test, said founder David Schafran. Its not a check-up.From there, Blink sends all the gathered information from the test to optometrists that the company has partnered with, who then spend about ten minutes analyzing the data and writing out a prescription. The prescription is then sent to the user via email and can be used to buy a new pair of glasses  the company is working on a solution to measure for contact lens prescriptions.For every vision test Blink performs, the company gives a vision test and a free pair of glasses to someone who is in need locally.It costs $75 to do a vision test, but if you get a few friends or co-workers together, the price per person goes down based on the number of tests a Visioneer gives in a single visit.", "title": "Blink, Offering Vision Tests On-Demand, Launches In NewYork"},

The response has been overwhelmingly positive, he added, citing social media reaction.This product launch has been unusual in a number of ways, but one of the most significant was the unavailability of Apple Watch units in retail stores at launch. Customers only had the option to pre-order the devices online initially, and while they could schedule appointments to try them on in retail locations, they could not actually make a purchase on the spot and walk away with product.While Apple shipment windows for devices , the ship times anticipated on the store site currently still show long wait times. Theres also that band options are determining the shipment variance from model to model.Right now, demand is greater than supply, so were working hard to remedy that, Cook said on the call. We were able to ship more Watches during this past weekend than we had anticipated, he added, noting that theyre going to continue doing that, including sending more units out today.Sometime in late June, we anticipate being in a position that we could begin to sell the Apple Watch in additional countries, he said.", "title": "Apple Working Hard To Catch Up With Apple WatchDemand"},

Ironically, consumers either end up buying a plastic bottle of water, are forced to use a toilet to refill, or feel obliged to buy something from a store before asking for a refill of water. is a new graduate of the accelerator with a rather clever idea. It sells and produces stainless steel water bottles that you can use to get free water refills from participating local cafes and restaurants, which are located by using the GiveMeTap App ( & ). You just walk in, find the water station and fill up or ask someone at the counter. The mobile app will even track your water usage.The really clever part of its model is that business owners are incentivized to join the network because they get free publicity, increased footfall  and heres the tech part  access to data about how many new customers they are gaining because of the app. Obviously, people with the bottles are more likely to choose a GiveMeTap venue and purchase other goods there.The app uses geofencing to confirm the locations and to help with seamless checkins. It also includes a discounts system for people who refill their bottles at cafes; helping cafes attract new customers. For every X number of refills (set by the business owner), the consumers get an offer from the store which can be redeemed. When a bottle owner redeems the offer, the business can judge the incremental value of GiveMeTap and tie that into any sales uplift.The model sounds pretty good but it gets even better: While consumers get free water, a portion of each bottle sale goes to help give clean water to a person in Africa for fiveyears. So, this is not dissimilar to the Tomsshoes model, but for water bottles. And this is even a for-profit business, not a charity.Each time you refill the bottle, GiveMeTap donates an additional day of clean water to a person in Africa via its partners. It also gives 20% from the sale of each bottle to Pronet, their water NGO partner in Ghana, who has been installing water pumps in Ghana for over 25 years.Its also just partnered with several tech startups in SF as part of a new This swag saves lives. Companies get their logo on the bottle and the bottles get used and carried around: so more free advertising.Despite it graduating from YC, GiveMeTap is not a brand-new startup. Starting in 2013, it was the first water refill network in the UK and ended up scaling to over 630 cafes/restaurants, including Pizza Hut, selling over 40,000 GiveMeTap bottles. Assuming none of the buyers ever buy more plastic bottles, that would translate to roughly 6 million fewer plastic bottles in landfills, and provide 5,334 people in Africa with clean drinking water for life.In January this year, the startup expanded into San Francisco, sold over 1,000 bottles and now have 160 GiveMeTap locations in the city.In theory, if all GiveMeTap bottles took over form plastic bottles sold in the US, theyd take out around 50 billion bottles a year (worth about $1 Billion a year). Only 23 percent plastic bottles are actually recycled.You can get the water bottles either online or from a stockist. All GiveMeTap bottles are 18/8 Food-grade stainless steel and 100% free of toxins, BPA, phthalate and PVC. The bottles cost $18-20 and come in 2 sizes (16 oz and 23 oz) and 4 different colours (Blue, Black, Hot Pink, Silver).GiveMeTap is also poised to take advantage of local governments war on waste and costs. San Francisco has now banned plastic water bottles at public events and spaces, which is similar to the plastic bottle ban in Massachusetts and across several university campuses. The reusable water bottle market is estimated to be worth $1.5 billion and is the fastest-growing consumer durables product.GiveMeTap was founded by Edwin Broni-Mensah, a former Quant Analyst inside investment banks. He came up with the GiveMeTap idea after going on a fitness regime which required him to get ripped in 90 days by drinking four to five litres of water a day during exercising.The irony is that Broni-Mensahs father was originally from Ghana, where water is a pretty scarce commodity.", "title": "YC Graduate GiveMeTap Offers Free Water And Footfall Data For Stores, And It HelpsAfrica"},

Thats a pretty strong riposte.But the advantages that Apple has in the camera + phone space arent just ones of momentum. Most of its leverage comes in the fact that it has been proactive, not reactive, about photography.Rather than buying whatever the next highest megapixel array is available to it and stuffing it in the iPhone, Apple has invested deeply in the less visible and less toutable bits of the photographic imaging chain.The major portions of that chain include lenses, imaging sensors, image processors and software. Currently, Apple is using Sony Exmor RS image sensors, but has emphasized improvements like backside illumination and pixel pitch over raw megapixel count. This takes some amount of guts, because its much easier to market a higher number than it is to do the same for an intangible, potential increase in image quality.Just ask Canon, who actually point-and-shoot cameras from 14.7 back down to 10 in 2009. The increase in megapixels had led to awful issues in image noise and Canon had to make the tough decision to dial it back (resulting in far better low-light images in the G11). Those kinds of statement decisions that benefit the user are hard ones to make, but the payoff in pictures is worth it.Another advantage here is that Apple makes and customizes its own image processing chips. Canon and Nikon, the most popular SLR manufacturers and imaging legends, both make and program their own image processors, as well  because they understand that this is the most pivotal portion of the imaging chain. (Though I do feel that the latest iPhones over-noise-reduce and over-sharpen a bit, but thats another topic.)Those advantages are difficult to compete with because they require years of investment, a willingness to make tough decisions and ownership of the entire chain right up to the software that drives the camera.Its going to be tough for Android manufacturers to compete with the iPhone here, because one or more of those factors are often out of their hands. Microsoft probably has the best chance and has already produced some very decent Lumia camera systems.But, eventually, someone is going to make a pretty amazing Android camera phone. Maybe its even this year at MWC. Which is why its probably a good time to run an ad crowing about your lead.", "title": "Apple Would Like You To Know People Think The iPhones Camera IsAwesome"},

Weve now tried the companys latest revision of its unreleased augmented reality headset and even built an app for it. The new hardware, which Microsoft also showcased during its Build developer conference keynote yesterday, feels very solid and the user experience (mostly) delivers on the companys promises.Earlier today, Microsoft gave developers and some of us media punditsa chance to spend some quality time with HoloLens by building our own holographic application using the Unity engine and Visual Studio.HoloLens is all about augmented reality. Its about placing objects into the real world, which you can still see while youre wearing the headset. Its not a virtual reality headset like the Oculus Rift, so its not about total immersion. Instead, it lets you see objects on a table in front of you that arent there in the real world, for example, and it lets you interact with them as if they were real objects.When you first see somebody who isusing HoloLens, youll probably think something is wrong with them. Theyll walk aroundthings you cant see, make random click gestures in the air (air-tapping is what Microsoft calls that) and probably ooh and ahh a few times.Until youve used HoloLens  and very few people have  this all sounds very abstract. But once you strap it on and use it, its indeed a bit of a revelation.The early (and highly positive reviews) from , where a few select members of the press got to try it, werent an exaggeration.Let me walk you through the experience Microsoft put on for us today.After locking all of our electronic devices in a locker (evensmartwatches),Microsoft paired us up with a mentor who would walk us through the rest of the experience.We all got our own HoloLens and a PC to code on and four members of the team walked us through building a simple HoloLens app. First, though, they taught us how to use the basic gestures that work across all apps: air clicks (for selecting stuff); gazes (which is really just about looking at things); and voice commands (which developers can easily customize).With that out of the way, we loaded a couple of preset assets into Unity, made a few minor modifications to the scene, and then exported everything to Visual Studio. From there, deploying the app to the HoloLens (over USB) was just a matter ofa few clicks.The scene Microsoft had pre-built was a sketchbookwith a few cubes on top of it, two paper airplanes that leanedagainst the cubes,and two paper balls that were suspended in the air over them (so they could bounce off the paper airplanes).We started with a very basic, static scene and then added more interactivity from there. At every step, we would go to Unity, add new features, deploy the app and strap on the HoloLens again to take another look at our creation.At its most basic, the Unity SDK allows you to simply place an object at a certain distance and height from where the device is pointing at when you initialize the application. That object is then suspended in that spot in space and you can walk around it.We then added a bit of interactivity so the balls would drop when you clicked on them, as well as sound and  finally  the HoloLens ability to detect objects in the world and have the whole scene and the dropping balls interact with it.Because HoloLens knows what youre looking at  and uses that to allow developers to place a small 3D cursor into the scene  you can easily use air clicks or voice commands to interact with objects.Thats really what HoloLens is about, too. We were able to drop the scene on a table for example. Then the balls would drop and roll off the sketchbook. So far so good, but the ballsalso dropped off the real table and maybe got stuck against the sofa next to it. Thats very impressive, because that kind of real-world mapping is hard to do.HoloLens constantly scans the world around you and then builds a (somewhat crude) model of it. Thats how it knows where the ground is, for example. It doesnt know that a table is a table, but it does know that theres a flat surface there.The same goes for any other kind of objects.While I originally assumed HoloLens  like most other augmented reality applications  needs some kind of QR code or markers to know where to place objects, it can actually recognize the world around you and then allows you to place objects where you want them. Using the Unity physics engine, it can interact with them.For the grand finale, we added a new object to the scene that would explode when one of the balls hit it  and which then revealed a cavernous world underneaththe floor with a stream and animated birds. That was obviously the most impressive demo and really showed the potential of HoloLens. You could even drop the balls into that cavern and see them bounce 20feet beneath your feet.The new hardware we used felt very solid and unlike the first prototypes, its an untethered, standalone unit. You use a headband to strap the device to your face, and while the device is not exactly light, the smart weight distribution between the front and back makes up for that.Microsoft admonished us to be careful with the units, but they didnt feel fragile at all.I wouldnt be surprised if this model turned out to be very close to the final production unit.Going into the demo, I wasespecially interested in how well the holograms would lock into place. That, after all, is very hard to do, and if objects start randomly moving around as you walk around them, its hard to feel like they were really there. I was surprised how well this worked. I found myself trying to kick the little paper balls with my foot after they had rolled off the table (but sadly, the algorithms are clearly not quite fast enough yet for this kind of real-time interaction).There is, however, still a little bit of jitter to the holograms that is mostly noticeable when you get close to them. They really feel like theyre locked in place, though, and thats the real achievement here, especially given that Microsoft is not using any markers for placing them. You can randomly move objects around in space. They will stay put. No QR codes necessary.My best guess is that Microsoft is using one (or more) of Movidius in the device to be able to do the positional tracking necessary to enable all of this.The one disappointment for me in trying HoloLens wasthat the field of view was verylimited. This was not a totally immersive experience because objectswouldget cut off long before you would naturally expect them to drop out of sight.Some of the writers who saw Microsofts first demo told me that they felt the viewing angle onthese new devices was smaller than during the first demo. I cant verify that, though.What did surprise me, though, was how little opacity there was to the holograms. I expected them to look somewhat transparent, with the background shining through. That really wasnt the case, though. They looked really solid and there was almost no transparency.Todays demo obviously happened in acontrolled environment, but it was nowhere as controlled as I expected. People moved around as four or five of us gathered around a table to look at our holograms and everything still worked really well.At the end of the session, I came away very impressed. When I first heard about HoloLens, I thought this was a technology that was still very far away from being production-ready and I assumed that the demos Microsoft showed earlier this year were simply well-staged and had managed to pull the wool over the assembled tech press. Now, I wouldnt be surprised if Microsoft started selling HoloLens within a year (the company, of course, wont say when HoloLens will go on sale or at what price).", "title": "HoloLens Hands-On: How We Built An App For Microsofts Augmented RealityHeadset"},

This marks one of the largest funding rounds in a fabless semiconductor company in recent years.New investors in this round includeARCH Venture Partners andSunny Optical Technology Group, as well as early investors Atlantic Bridge Capital, AIB SeedCapital Fund, Capital-E, DFJ Esprit and Robert Bosch Venture Capital.The company, which has offices in Silicon Valley, Irelandand Romania, plans to use the new funding to push its R&D efforts forward, hire more engineers and to improve the software tools that help developers make the most out of itsaccelerated computer visionprocessor.As Movidius CEO RemiEl-Ouazzane tells me, the companys products will appearin a number of consumer devicesin the coming months  and most of them will come fromwell-known brands. While he obviously couldnt disclose the actual products, he noted that Movidius seems have arrived on the market at just the right time. Specifically, he cited the growing interest in drones and VR as markets wherethe companys technologies are a perfect fit. Drones, after all, can only fly autonomously when they can see (and avoid) the world around them and collision avoidance is currently still so hard to implement that not even the most expensive professional drones try to attempt it.In the realm of VR (and augmented reality projects like Microsofts HoloLens), Movidius can power the kind of positional tracking and eye tracking that makes for the kind of low latency experience that then enables the necessarysense of presence that makes the VR experience truly immersive. El-Ouazzane tells me the company is currently working with three of the five main head-mounted display manufacturers.As El-Ouazzane also noted, its very hard to raise funding for a semiconductor company, even in todays venture capital market. The bar to raise money is very, very high, he said and he also acknowledged that large incumbents like Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm are also interested in this field. He believes, however, that Movidius can stay ahead of the competition thanks to its existing IP and focus on software tools. Its our job to make sure that the combination of price, performance and power is unbeatable, he said.Interestingly, Movidius is willing to cede the market for vision processing incars to others. The lead times to get products to market there aresimply too long for a small startup that needs to generate some cash flow. We are going for high-growth markets at the cutting edge instead,El-Ouzzane told me.Specifically, he believes the Chinese market will have a major impact on his company. I have a firm belief that China is going to take some steps forward to take the lead in some markets  and especially in markets that matter to us, he said. One of the leaders in the drone industry [DJI] is Chinese; the largest camera module manufacturer is Chinese. So to accelerate its presence in China, the company specifically looked for lead investors with a strong background there for this round and found them in WestSummit and Atlantic Bridge.As for the companys roadmap, El-Ouazzane tells me that the next version of Movidius vision processor is coming soon.We are entering the Golden Age of accelerated computer vision, he believes and with this new funding round, Movidius is well-positioned to help usher in this future where our devices are more aware than ever of whats going on in theirsurroundings.", "title": "Movidius Raises $40M To Bring Computer VisionTo MobileDevices"},

Id argue that the iPads primary success factor, as well as the reason behind both its recent flat sales, and whyit stillhas plenty of years left as one of computings most successful device categoriesare all one and the same: Extreme flexibility.Apples slate is a gadget with many lives; the original iPad is still in service for at least a few friends I know, despite not supporting the latest hardware. Its web browser is still perfectly functional for those whose needs rarely extend beyond a little Internet wandering, and while Ive had one of just about every iPad model to date, the older ones always creep back into active use in varying capacities.Sometimes, itll seem as though the need for an iPad is waning in light of improvements to surrounding tech  better battery life for MacBooks, for instance, or larger displays on devices like the iPhone 6 Plus. Yet an iPad is always uniquely suited to some specific task, and having them around provides an immense convenience benefit vs. not having them when those needs arise. For instance, iPads have proven ideal digital comics readers; under-cabinet mounted interactive recipe books and YouTube viewers; guitar instructor; and even in-car navigation systems even in times when I wasnt using them on a daily basis as a general purpose computing device.Ive often found that its easy to forget about the iPad, especially five years after its launch; but the tendency to overlook the Apple tablet is evidence that it has achieved exactly its designers original intent. This is a computer that excels at getting out of the way, resulting in a transparent computing experience that you dont even realize is happening. The best process, after all, is one thats so natural as to go mostly unnoticed.The iPad becomes whatever you need it to, and even older hardware can perform many of these functions very well. Thats why I think recent flat growth in sales isnt a significant klaxon to worry about  it means that older devices are still quietly helping in the background exactly as they were intended to, leaving users without any strong impetus to upgrade immediately. But if anything, the iPads usefulness is only more deeply ingrained than ever, meaning its not something many will come to appreciate until older hardware fails to live up to modern software needs, or theres a breakdown, etc.To some extent, weve only just begun to see the potential of the iPad as a solution to computing problems we didnt even know existed. It could be the perfect console for managing a smart home, for instance, or an ideal production device with advances made possible by improvements to mobile processor and input tech. But the iPads key virtue is that it will continue to fulfill our needs with a quiet elasticity thats hard to identify except in retrospect.", "title": "At 5, The iPads Chief Feature Is Its LastingElasticity"},

To wit  the features described for the update would allow Android Wear devices to connect to Wi-Fi, which the Apple Watch can do; navigate through lists and notifications without using your finger to block the screen, which the Apple Watch can do; and to more easily access apps installed on the watch, which the Apple Watch can do.It fits perfectly with Android Wears overall product strategy to introduce these updates in the near future (at Google I/O in May, perhaps?) since the OS has seemed from the start like a work-in-progress, an experiment run Google-style in the wide laboratory of the world. Plenty of OEMs have signed on to make Android Wear devices, but it has been a learning process, with things like software customization and features like GPS support meted out in increments by Google in regular platform updates.Wi-Fi should actually work backwards with many existing devices, since hardware like the Moto 360 and Sony SmartWatch 3, for instance, already support its use. It will allow features like notifications and Google Now to operate without a Bluetooth connection to a paired device. Apples use of Wi-Fi allows the Apple Watch to communicate with its paired iPhone when both are on the same local wireless network, but not within Bluetooth range or with Bluetooth turned off on the iPhone, at least in the current version of the software.The digital crown on the Apple Watch allows you to scroll without obscuring content, both between glances and vertically when theres a waterfall of content. Android Wear is designed for touch-based use, and some hardware designs dont even offer any means of physical input in the form of a simple button. Gestures could help alleviate the problem, but without a look at how they might work in practice, its hard to see that beating the smooth, natural mechanics of the digital crown.Wearables trying to keep pace with and outdo each other will likely become the new normal once the Apple Watch hits the market on April 24, so expect more frequent (and possibly more ambitious) Android Wear updates to come.", "title": "Wi-Fi And Gestures Could Soon Help Android Wear Match Some Apple WatchAdvantages"},

Chinese smartphone makershave used Androids open source core to fork and package the UI with local alternatives. And while Xiaomi has also done that in China, Barra was making it plainthat thatis the exception for Xiaomi, notthe rule.We have no plans to take that [the Mi app store] outside of China, because we are working with Google in every other market, said Barra. We are a GMS [Google Mobile Services] partner. We have been from the very first day that we sold our first device outside of China.He went further, adding that in his view GMS apps  includingthe Play Store, Gmail, YouTube and Google Maps  are essentiallynecessary for survival for anyone who is outside of China.We are, I believe, the number three Android app store in China today, he added. Im not 100 per cent sure on that position because its not something that can be easily calculated but I think were about the number three. And I think its a consequence of the fact that our platform, MIUI, has become very popular, not only through our own device sales but the fact that its the most popular Android ROM in China. And with that comes the Mi app store.Last month Xiaomi, to explain itself toa market it has not yet launched smartphones in but is planning to offer what Barra referred totoday as its hero accessories.ThoseU.S. baby steps are aboutintroducing Xiaomis brand in a place where its likely only known to tech bloggers, he added.You can think of it as beginning of the process of building our brand in markets where people dont yet know about us, he said.Healso talked up the complexity of launching tightly integrated smartphone hardware plus services into a new market like the U.S., and described the market as offeringa less powerful value proposition for Xiaomi  which typically sells its smartphone hardware at near cost price, including offering premium, high end devices.That means keeping costs down is key to Xiaomis business model. Barra touched onvarious ways it does that, includinghaving a very limited portfolio ofdevices which mayremain on sale for longer than the average to achieve better economies of scale and reductions in manufacturing costs; selling devices directly, meaning there are no third parties taking sales commission; and spending little or nothing on below the line digital advertising, relying instead on social media and online word of mouth for marketing.Weve got to bring all of those services to the U.S. when and if were ready to launch there, and then theres marketing  theres a whole other set of things we have to do. And then theres the fact the U.S. is a carrier-led market where subsidies are very common In some ways  and also considering the fact that GDP per capita in the U.S. is so much higher our value proposition is not as intensively powerful as it is in a market like Brazil or Russia, or Indonesia, or India  which is our biggest overseas market right now, he said.That only means yes we would love to be in the U.S. with our flagship products but it is not at the top of our priority list  or anywhere near the top of our priority list, he added.", "title": "Xiaomis Hugo Barra Confirms No Plans To Push Its App Store OutsideChina"},

Today, it seems, is the day that Jobs one-button vision is being finally realized.Phil Schillers description of Force Touch was pretty nerdy. Essentially, instead of adding a pivoting sheet of glass, the company created a system that enables variable resistance for each click. That means you can either tap the touchpad or give it a harder press in order to bring up the functions that were usually associated with the right-click.

Thats a revised timeline from an earlier plan that targeted the first half of this year, but since the products existence hasnt yet even been acknowledged by Apple, that kind of timetable change isnt surprising. What is surprising, however, are the potential hardware features that WSJ reports Apple has worked on for the upcoming device, which may or may not make their way to the final design.Apple is thinking about adopting USB 3.0 for faster transfer speeds between the large iPad and computers, external drives and other accessories, the report claims, and has even mulled adding additional USB I/O ports beyond the single Lightning port found on current model iPhone and iPad devices. Its also looking at tech that might enable much faster charging time, but all of these potential features are still only being considered for inclusion, and could easily be left out of the eventual shipping product, per the report.Charging time on the iPad Air currently sits at around four hours from zero to empty using the included charger in the box, and it would make sense that a device with a larger 12.9-inch display would likely also boast a much larger battery, in part because it would have the added surface area required to do so, and in part because a bigger display with similar pixel density would likely require more available power to achieve battery life similar to the existing iPad models. Improving total charge speed would help offset the additional plug-in duration required to fill up a larger powerhouse.Faster I/O and additional inputs could reflect an iPad with a different purpose  Apple has been said to be gearing this device to enterprise customers and professional users, and providing a means though which to connect gear like mice and keyboards might make a lot of sense if indeed theyre going after that crowd. USB 3.0 is also more valuable on a device like this, vs. on existing iPhone and iPad models, since a tethered connection to a computer is becoming less and less important to most casual mobile device users. For a more business-oriented crowd, or people working with large files (creative pros, for instance) that kind of connection is much more relevant and useful on a daily basis.Like rumors of a stylus designed for the larger iPad before it, many will dismiss these new proposed features as being completely out of line with existing iPad and iOS device design trends. Apple has almost seemed to abhor external ports, and in fact another rumor, this time about the 12-inch MacBook Air, says its limiting I/O to just one port on that device, which would almost seem to be motivated by exactly the opposite kind of approach to industrial design. Despite ample reason to be skeptical about an iPad Pro with an assortment of ports, however, dismissing them outright seems premature, given the companys recent direction.For a larger iPad to exist at all is already likely a difficult scenario for most to wrap their head around, given Apples current product mix and where a 12.9-inch tablet could fit. And the Apple Watch is another example where not everyone readily saw the value in Apple plan. Id argue that the Apple of today is harder to pin down in terms of product direction, because while the decision-making is still sound and will, I think, ultimately lead to greater success, the major changes that it has undergone in recent years make it harder to anticipate future moves.Basically, Im saying that while a 12.9-inch iPad sprouting ports doesnt seem like an Apple move, it could provide a solid bedrock upon which to renew a push for creative and enterprise adoption, both of which markets seem increasingly to be desirable targets for Cupertino based on things like Apples continued highlighting of creative apps for iOS and Mac, and its partnership with IBM.", "title": "Apples 12.9-inch iPad Sounds Like It Could Stretch The Definition Of iPad"},

But how do you run Windows on a RaspPi? And why?First, I invite you to check out GitHub page where they offer instructions for installing Windows 10 onto Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Galileo, and MinnowBoard. The page offers instructions for getting the official image for use with these devices. You can also just download it .A note to OSX users: I originally hoped to include instructions on how to flash an SD card for RaspPi2 using OS X or Linux but, sadly, Microsofts FFU image files require specific Windows file handling software. I tried converting this to an image file using obvious methods (changing the extension) and unobvious methods (looking hither and yon for an answer) but generally it was a problem I couldnt solve. I will update this post when I find a solution.Here is how to install Windows 10 IoT onto your Raspberry Pi.1. Create an account at .2. Download the file which contains flash.ffu. Place this file in an accessible place.3. Insert a blank 8GB Class 10 SD card into your computer.4. Open a command prompt and type:This will allow you to find the drive number for your SD card. Use this in the next step.5. Finally, follow Microsofts own instructions for flashing the SD card in Windows 10.Using the administrator command prompt, apply the image to your SD card by running the following command (be sure to replace PhysicalDriveN with the value you found in the previous step, for example, if your SD card is disk number 3, use /ApplyDrive:\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive3 below):6. Safely remove the SD card.The card is now ready to boot in your Raspberry Pi 2.The Windows IoT shell is a Universal app like any other on Win10. That's all your RPi will do :D  Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) Why would you want to do this? Well, as Microsoft notes, Windows 10 IoT Core is a new Windows 10 edition for low-cost, small-footprint devices that will be available free for Makers and commercial device builders. This means you can easily flash and use a stripped-down version of Windows in your own projects. Interestingly, this version of Windows will be very familiar to users of similar platforms like Arduino and Rasbian.Dont expect to be playing Far Cry on this thing anytime soon  think of it as more of a universal app platform that connects to simple devices like Arduino-based relays and LEDs. In fact the UI is quite limited unless you program some apps yourself.Its a surprisingly friendly move by Microsoft to bring this to market, however, and I think even the most die-hard open-source fan will agree that getting more people to use Raspberry Pi in embedded projects is a noble goal  whatever the OS.Let me know if you guys have built anything cool using Windows 10 and maybe we can showcase some of the products down the line.", "title": "How To Install Windows 10 IoT On Your Raspberry Pi2"},

Apples early marketing around the Watch has focused mainly on its construction, originality and possibilities for customization. Thats not a bad thing at all, but its much more suited to a product thats entering an upgrade cycle. The last few years of iPhone or iPad releases is a good example of this. If youre going to convince someone they might like to purchase the new one youre going to highlight differentiating design, color, materials or functionality.For a completely new category of product, Apple had to dig back  all the way to the original iPhone  to remember how to position these things. Its probably difficult to recall, but the first iPhone was such a radical departure from anything that had come before it that Apple had a ton of explaining to do.Part of that explaining was laying out the features and functions (and their theoretical usefulness) in a series of to-the-point instructional . They went over things that seem second nature now: deleting a voicemail, reading and flagging email, browsing the web in a real web browser.The instruction was largely based on the fact that we were moving from buttons to a brand-new interface: multi-touch.So a set of four videos, which will be expanded in the future, that explains very plainly how Apple Watch features work and why youd want to use them makes a lot of sense. The Watch is also introducing the new Digital Crown and Force Touch mechanisms to Apples interface lexicon. Those new interaction methods add additional possibility, but also need an introduction that ties them in with explicit actions like sending emoji, checking your calendar or transmitting your heartbeat.Another thing that is emphasized heavily throughout these videos is how features like glances, Force Touch and the very nature of a watch will enable you to interact with apps or messages quickly and get back to what you were doing before. This very, very strong selling point for the Apple Watch has thus far been missing from its marketing  including during both of its on-stage appearances.Weve that the primary early selling fulcrum of the Apple Watch would be that it would save you time by letting you use your phone less. Apple has apparently caught on to this sales bullet and project lead Kevin Lynch emphasizing it during an interview with Wired.People want that level of engagement, Lynch says. But how do we provide it in a way thats a little more human, a little more in the moment when youre with somebody?That point is made in both straightforwardand subtle ways throughout these videos, and I would expect to continue to see it highlighted as Apple gets into the full swing of selling the devices. The long-term possibilities of Apple Watch as a lubricant are another matter entirely  but thats down the road and there is plenty of time to paint that picture later.

How is it, then, that some products thrive despite flagrant shortcomings?To find out why  likely be disappointed by the , meet Professor Noriaki Kano. In the 1980s Professor Kano developed a to explain a theory of customer satisfaction.Kano believes products have particular attributes, which are directly responsible for users happiness. He discovered that some qualities matter more than others. Kano describes three product attribute types (loosely translated from Japanese as): delightful, linear and hygienic features.A delightful feature is an attribute of a product that customers love but do not expect. For example, if the made coffee every morning, that would be a delightfully surprising feature.A linear feature, on the other hand, is one users expect. More of that quality increases satisfaction. Battery life is an example of a linear feature of the . trust that it will last all day but the more juice the battery has, the less to charge it and the happier are.Customers are typically able to articulate the linear attributes of a product (I want it to have long battery life) whereas by definition they cant tell they want a delightful feature until theyve seen it in action. Like knowing the punchline of a joke: If what to expect it fails to delight.Finally, hygienic or basic features are must-haves. Customers not only expect these attributes, but they depend on them. If the is bad at telling time, for example, would undoubtedly be very ticked (tocked) off.Ellen DeGeneres tweeted a sardonic comment that perfectly demonstrates what happens when we make a basic feature sound like a delighter.So excited for the Apple Watch. For centuries, weve checked the time by\nlooking at our phones. Having it on your wrist? Genius.  Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) Joking aside, CEO Tim Cook knows just how telling time is for an expensive timepiece. Cook emphasizes that the device is accurate within 50 milliseconds. In addition, when the battery is almost depleted, the kicks into Power Reserve mode, shutting down everything but the ability to see the time.Obviously, understands telling time is a hygienic feature. However, when it comes to this basic feature, something is still missing. This brings me to what will likely annoy about the .A basic attribute of any is that it allows wearers to see the time the time. With a regular , checking the time couldnt be easier. only to glance down to what time it is  not so with the .To save battery life, the goes dark when it thinks re not using it.

It got to or so, and I started glancing at my every few minutes. But it was always off  the only way I could check the time was to artificially flick my wrist or to use my right hand to tap the screen  in either case, a far heavier gesture than the mere glance Id have needed with my regular .Who hasnt sat across from an overly gabby colleague wondering whether  be late to your next meeting? If weve bothered to wear a , we expect to be able to see the time at a glance. But if telling the time on your requires a spastic wrist jolt,  curse it.Gruber continued:  for regular wearers, its going to take some getting used to, and its always going to be a bit of an inconvenience compared to an always-glance-able . Its a fundamental conflict: a regular never turns off, but a display like s cannot always stay on.The problem is significant enough that other smart makers already see s failing as an opportunity. The recently announced , for example, uses a low-power color e-paper display and never goes dark.Of course, all this doesnt mean re not going to buy the . may very well make the wake feature so sensitive that few people are troubled by it. After all, even an obvious wrist shake is better than the inconvenience of checking the time by taking out your phone. However, greater turn-on sensitivity will come at the expense of battery life, a compromise consumers arent going to be happy about. To avoid disappointment, keep your expectations low and be prepared to miss some basic features d expect from even a cheap .Remember, the iPhone in the beginning. s choice of AT&T as the exclusive service provider for the first few generations of the iPhone meant . The device was often loathed for its inability to deliver the basic Kano feature customers expected most from a phone  namely, to complete a call.Over time, the technology improved, but why did people put up with these seemingly fatal flaws for so long? Here again, the Kano model helps us better understand the mindset of consumers.People kept using (and often praising) the iPhone because the delight factor made up for its lack of basic attributes. Mainly, s App Store and its near infinite variety of nifty solutions provide a constant stream of delightful features even Steve Jobs could never have imagined.The iPhone still doesnt make coffee, but it does so many other surprising things didnt it could do when bought it (from checking your to identifying ) that overlook its flaws.As for the , over time will no doubt fix quirks in the first generation just as it did in subsequent iPhone editions. Ultimately, better battery life or alternative screens will keep future versions lit throughout the day. But the real delighter behind the , like the iPhone, will be the apps.

My money onthe 2 including a forward-facing camera, which wearers will discover makes taking pictures even easier and faster than using their phones.

Previously, games could be temporarily paused like this, but only while you exited to the menu to quickly check on something else.Another anticipated new feature coming with Yukimura (PS4 software version 2.50 if you want to get technical) is the ability to back-up and restore console HDD content to an external USB drive. That means you can fully back up the system, including everything from settings, saved data an screenshots to games, patches and downloads.You could back up saved data previously, but only to USB flash drives and everything else had to be re-downloaded from PlayStations servers if you ever needed to do a factory reset or set up a brand new console. This was not a super fun process, as I can personally attest, and being able to quickly load up your entire system as it had been from a mobile SSD should really help.Additional features include the ability to find fiends on PSN by searching through their linked Facebook account for those connections, and there are fewer steps required to make a party or join the games friends have in progress. You can now share your Trophy info via FB, Twitter or Message from the Share button menu, and Sony ha also added customization options for Dualshock 4 button layout, text-to-speech and graphical display options for accessibility benefits.The following additions are also new, direct from Sony:For games that support 60 fps, users will be able to stream those games with 60 fps for both Remote Play and Share Play on supported devices.: Users will be able to automatically install future system software updates.Users 18 years of age or older with sub-accounts will be able to upgrade to a master account directly on the PS4 system, removing restrictions on chat and enabling users to add funds to their Wallet, purchase content and more.: Verified accounts for game industry professionals, including developers, producers, designers and community managers will appear with a badge.: Players will have the ability to upload video clips directly to Dailymotion via the SHARE button.", "title": "PlayStation 4 Gets Suspend And Resume, External HD Backups On March26"},

But now, a new piece of smart jewelry called the  is combining technology with sentiment and emotion by allowing the jewelrys giver to record a digital memory to apearl necklace, ring or earrings, which is then accessed by tapping the pearl to an NFC-enabled smartphone.Historically, giving jewelry as a gift has been thought of being an act of love, and the Momento Pearl is no different.The idea here is to create a line of interactive gems, beginning with pearls but eventually expanding into other gemstones, which function as something of an upgrade to the traditional keepsake locket.While in the past, people would tuck small photos into hinged lockets as a way of keeping their loved ones close, the Momento Pearl allows you to record and save digital photos, as well as videos, voice recordings, text messages and more into hardware embedded inside a hand-carved white freshwater or black Tahitian pearl set in sterling silver or 14K white or yellow gold.The conceptfor this modern-day twist on the old-fashioned locket was dreamed upbylongtime jewelry designer,Chi Huynh, whose company Galatea is known best for its carved line of pearls, created by their own patented and proprietary process. Those same pearls are what are featured here, except theyve been upgraded with NFC technology and 500 MB of storage space (or 1 GB if the company exceeds its Kickstarter goal.)The company already has the technology developed and ready to ship, but is raising funds on Kickstarter moreto generate awareness for its new technology, which its also selling direct to retailers. Notably, the price points on the Kickstarter campaign, which offers rewards starting at just $95, are much lower than those for the same items Galatea is selling to retailers.Retailers will sell the items for price points of around$400 in their own stores, the company tells us. SeveralKickstarter items can instead be boughtfor less than half that.The way the technology works involves the combination of NFC inside the pearl and . Unfortunately, this smart jewelry is Android-only for now, because Apple has yet to open up its iPhones NFC component for use outside of Apple Pay. (If that occurs, though, Momento Pearl will expand to support iOS devices, as well.)After you buy the jewelry, you tap it to your Android smartphone, which will launch the apps page on the Google Play store. You install the app to your phone and open it, then begin filling it with your digital memories by tapping on buttons for adding photos, text, voice recordings, web links or videos. When youve finished uploading, you tap the pearl to the phone again to save your content to the jewelry item. The apps data is also synced with the cloud so in the event the jewelry becomes lost, the memories it included are not.The jewelrys owner can set one of the items to be the featured memory, meaning the one that plays immediately when tapped to a smartphone. However, the recipient can also share the account associated with the app so they cabswap out featured memories as they choose by logging into the app. This way, the gift giver canalso update the jewelry with new memories by uploading more content intothe app for the recipient to choose to rotate through over time.Because the jewelry relies on NFC technology inside of Bluetooth, the necklace, rings and earrings dont require charging, nor do they need batteries, making them a bit more practical than a number of smart jewelry pieces on the market today. Theyre also waterproof, so you can swim with them or wear them in the shower.While the current line of jewelry offered includes only pearls, which can sometimes be thought of as a bit old-fashioned, their hand-carved look at least gives them a more modern feel. And theres also one piece called the Beauty Inside thats unique  its a hand-carved Tahitian Galatea pearl whichincludes a gemstone grown inside.Additionally, the company says that now they have the technology working, the plan is to introduce it into a range of jewelry items in the future, including a variety of other colored gemstones to start.The Momento Pearl is with promises to begin shipping next month. So far, just over $16,000 has been raised with 11 days to go. Most of the items on Kickstarter are in the hundred to few hundred dollar range, though there are high-end items available for $1,425 and up, as well.", "title": "The Momento Pearl Smart Jewelry Offers A Digital Upgrade To The KeepsakeLocket"},

The laptop has a smaller bezel around its screen and its keyboard reaches both edges of the base.

You can also now use thepush harder than the usual tap and have it count as a separate gesture, just like the Watch.Just as the original MacBook Air ushered in a new way of thinking about expansion and media by cutting out legacy ports and the DVD drive, the new 12-inch MacBook Air is designed for a world where your primary computing device is your smartphone, not your laptop.Besides the headphone jack, theres only one port on the new MacBook. Its the new reversible USB-C connector, which can charge the laptop, send video to an external display, and carry data at USB 3 rates.

The Internet of Things wascertainly top of mind. Vendorsare merging mobile into your biggest mobile device: your car. Smartwatches are a growing force, but what really caught my attention is that we are teetering on the edge of mass market virtual reality.TechCrunchs this week, a joint venture between HTC and Valve, and to say he was pumped would be an understatement.When I say I was impressed, amused, and excited, trust me. This was one of the best things Ive seen in a long time and I am thrilled that I got to be part of it.Thats high praise from a man who isnt easily impressed, but HTC wasnt alone in trying to present virtual reality at this years conference. Everywhere you looked in the real world, people were wearing virtual reality glasses.Heres the thing. We are early in the virtual reality game. Much like the vast array of smart watches I saw in a variety of shapes and sizes, it is early days for VR equipment. They remain big and clunky and look kind of funky  but they are getting closer.Even the HTC product was huge, and as Biggs described it, very much in the prototype stage.When I saw Oculus Rift CEO Brendan Iribe speaking on stage at Web Summit last November, he talked about needing to refine the hardware design. He understood the equipment is still too big today, and as such it will only appeal to a small sub-section of geeks.He said his companys goal was to reduce the size of the hardware to a pair of designer sunglasses  and with each passing iteration the company has gotten closer to that goal.While I couldnt demo the HTC tool, whatI saw and experiencedthis week were big goggles that you pulled over your eyes to be immersed in a virtual world. When I tried the virtual home tour at the AT&T Connected City, I sat in a chair and felt myself immersed in a graphicalhome full of facts and figures. I was able to control my actions by staring at a window to enter a room or the floor to exit, but I found the whole thing a bit slow to react and not quite what I would have liked, certainly nothing like the experience Biggs described when he tried on the HTC product.I tried another VR tour at Accentures booth one afternoon. This one involved drinking beer in real life and taking a tour of the Spanish Brewers Damm brewery building in the virtual world. You moved through the world by staring at arrows on the ground. One thing was clear, I did immediately feel transported to another place, so from that perspective, the software and graphics side is definitely getting there.But thehardware still needs work for this market to mature. Like everything else in mobile over time, it will grow smaller, faster and cheaper, and as it does it will enter the mainstream as a consumer device.It certainly has a future in immersive games, but Iribe also saw it as a way to hold virtual business meetings where everyone could sit in the same room in the form of avatars of course. It could make it possible to meet in person without traveling across the world to do it. Developers could create business-friendly tools like screen sharing apps and virtual whiteboards.While this all feels a bit like future games, its getting closer. As Biggs wrote in his piece:The content made the demo and Valves games were, in a word, amazing. They were funny, fun, and perfectly calibrated to excite the senses and incite wonder. It was interactive umami  the hardware, the software, the graphics, and the writing were all mixed together to create something that I have never seen.That suggests we are very close, closer than I believed, but we need to move beyond the prototype stage to the point that the hardware manufacturers refine the design and get this to market.It seemsthat were living on the edge ofvirtual worlds becoming a reality.", "title": "Teetering On The Edge Of Virtual Reality At Mobile WorldCongress"},

Its called Samsung Pay, and it uses the magnetic secure transmission (MST) tech that Samsung acquired via its , which means the vast majority of U.S. retailers should be able to accept it without any change to their existing hardware or infrastructure.The Samsung Pay service will also use NFC, meaning it should work with the kinds of terminals required by retailers to offer Apple Pay, but the MST tech means that it can talk even to old-school credit card swipe readers, via tech developed by the Kickstarted Boston-based startup LoopPay, which Samsung acquired in total after a partnership begun near the debut of their crowdfunding campaign.Samsung also has deals in place with MasterCard and Visa on the payment provider side, and is working on arrangements with American Express, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bank and others. Based on its ability to work with existing magstripe terminals, Samsung estimates that it could reach up to 30 million merchants worldwide, so long as the payment providers all come on board.In practice, itll work by being integrated into Samsung devices at the system level, letting users add their own existing cards, and then working via a swipe up from the bezel, which launches the Samsung Pay app and lets them choose their payment card option. Then they use the new finger print sensor to authenticate the transaction (which, thanks to the new touch-based fingerprint reader on the GS6, seems clearly borrowed from Apple Pay) and then tap the merchant terminal to complete. It requires a few more steps than Apple Pay, which automatically launches payment and chooses your default card when youre in proximity of an active terminal, meaning the fingerprint authentication is the only step required by a user.Samsung Pays ability to work with legacy infrastructure should help it maximize its potential reach, however, which means it could have an easier time convincing merchants, leaving it to focus its attention on educating and motivating users about adopting the behavior.On the security side, Samsung is using KNOX and ARMs TrustZone data isolation tech for processors to keep payment card information safe, and Samsung Pay uses tokenization to add an additional layer of security on top of standard magnetic card swipes. Its aiming for a summer launch, with U.S. and Korea pegged as the launch countries, with expansion to Europe and China planned after that.", "title": "Samsung Pay Takes On Apple Pay This Summer With LoopPays MSTTech"},

But the intent is just to prove viability of the project on a smaller scale, while also going beyond making something that is strictly a tech demo.Musk plans his own test track for the super-fast commuter train, the billionaire multi-CEO tweeted back in January. His intent with the project is to provide opportunities for third parties looking to test out their own pod designs, meaning hes still planning on keeping the Hyperloop project at arms length, while focusing on SpaceX and Tesla, as well as his role as Chairman of solar power startup .Will be building a Hyperloop test track for companies and student teams to test out their pods. Most likely in Texas. Elon Musk (@elonmusk) HTTs Hyperloop project seems to be turning more solid every day, but based on this most recent description of the project I cant help but be reminded of another small-town mass transit system.

Microsoft didnt respond.Microsoft is in a slightly uncomfortable position, building and releasing hardware that is designed for a new operating system that isnt quite done yet. will be out later this year, meaning that only the first few traunches of Surface 3 buyers will have to spend much time on Windows 8.1.

So the buyer specifies S, M or L for theframewidth, the nose pad, and the length of temples respectively.There are exact millimeter measures for all those sizing specifications, with the medium size being an average, and small and large aiming to cover the extreme cases. Monos coiled hinge design (also necessary for the glasses to be printable as one piece) and the flexible nylon material used for the framesarealso intended to helpachieve a betterfit.Wong says the nylon (fine Polyamaide PA 2000 to give it its technical name) is strong and durable, and able tostand up to UV exposure  as youd hope, given their exposed-to-the-elementssituationBut how do the flexible, one-piece specsstay on the wearers face? The end of the templesbend inwards and downwards slightly so are designed to hug the wearers head, according toWong. The lenses are held in place within the 3D printed nylon frames via grooves, as with conventional glasses. But Mono is making much of the ability to pop out your lenses on demand to switch between standard glasses andtinted and shaded lens as required  i.e. unlike conventional glasses.Wong says Mono has been around 10 months in developmentup to this point. Its been self-funded by him up to now, although he notes that desktop 3D printer prototypingallow for significantly reduced product dev costs and lower risk on such wackily creative gambles.The duo isnow looking to raise around $30,000 via Indiegogo to cover some less incremental manufacturing costs, such as minimum lens and accessories orders, as well as for other areas such as patent applications for their flexible, single-piece hinge design.Early crowdfunder backers can pledge fora pair of Mono optical glasses for $99, or $199 for sunglasses  due toship by August. A combo lens bundle which consists of the frames plus a pair of optical and a pair of tinted lenses costs $135.Whether wearing 3D-printed cartoon specs will make you look stylishor silly is another matter. But additive manufacturing is going to encourage more custom styling to creep into convention  so expect more playful and/or bespoke design to bea future standard.", "title": "See The Specs Restyled By 3DPrinting"},

Now, you can use any stylus, or even your finger, to control line width via the trackpad based on how hard you press.I tried it out, and its very much like drawing on a smaller version of the Wacom Bamboo series of tablets, meaning you also have to get used to positioning in order to really use it well. The app provides a highlighted area mapped directly to your trackpad by default, which makes it easier to use, and provides a number of tools accessible via gestures like two-finger pinch, zoom and rotate to manipulate the active drawing area depending on your preference.You can also tweak how it detects input (via holding down the space bar, or simply by noticing pressure), adjust sensitivity and range, and pretty much modify things to a place where youre more comfortable. All that said, I did find the input lagged a bit when using it with the most recent version of Photoshop on the 2015 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro. The company offers a free demo, so you can see if youre okay with the level of lag before you put down $25 to unlock the full version of the software.Its a very cool way to sketch on the road, however, without requiring an external tablet and while also providing the power of full Photoshop. Once I get used to the mapping, I could easily see using it for early brainstorm sketches, and even for slightly more involved graphics projects in a pinch.Ten One has also updated their to support pressure sensitivity via the new Force Touch trackpad to make for smoother, more ink-like signatures, and that update is also available today.", "title": "Inklet Adds Pressure Sensitive Drawing To Macs With Force TouchTrackpads"},

Apple already showed how Force Click can be used in its own applications and across the OS to do things like open up Wikipedia articles related to words in any field of text, but it seems like developers will be able to make use of these tools to have Force Click trigger the functions that are most relevant to the app at hand, on a software-specific basis.Apples support for pressure sensitivity, with specific mention of drawing and creative software, is one thing that struck me as particularly interesting in my early experience with the new Mac trackpads.

(Given the varying price-points, its possible Apple might offer certain types of internal upgrades to owners of only themore premium Apple Watches  whove shelled out the most in the first place.)Even so, battery longevity is arguably more of a pressing issue, given that the powerdemands for such a lightweight wearable are constrained by usage limitations. The use-cases Apple is sketching are mostly aboutallowing the owner to reduce their exposure to digital noise via curated notifications and selective communications.How much more processing clout you need to power that is up for debate, especially given that the Watch requires its wearersalso own an iPhone pocket computer  which they likely willcontinue to upgrade, per carrier cycles.The fitness anglefor Appleswearableisprobably going to bethe most power thirsty use-case, based on utilizing more sensor tech, soits likely no accident thesportswatchversion is the cheapest  and thus theleast painful toupgrade entirely.

The larger screen real estate opens a new paradigm in semi-portable computing. Suddenly developers have more room to work with, which consumers benefit from. Games can be more immersive, applications can display more options, and you can never have too many cells in a spreadsheet. The larger frames also make room for more batteries and more powerful chipsets.Yet interest has so far been low for the larger tablets. There are few options available.

Its the follow up to Jollasfirst device, the eponymous , which wasreleasedat the end of 2013.So far the Jolla Tablet has pulled in more than $2.2 million from more than 18,500 backers, far exceeding the original funding target. gives the underdog Sailfish a line in to mobiles biggest app ecosystem  so Jollacan offer mobile users an alternative to Android that nevertheless gives them access to Android apps (albeit not via Google Play).The 8-inch Jolla Tablet, which the companyis continuing to(currently priced at$249), is running Sailfish 2.0  the first major upgrade to its software platformsince launch.TechCrunchsat down with Jolla co-founder Marc Dillon to get a closer look at the tablet and OSupdate  check out the video to see Dillon demoing the new UI.Dillonalso told us that moreJolla devices are planned, hinting ata sequel smartphone,albeit he said its not making any specificannouncements about its roadmap at this point.So whats coming in Sailfish 2.0? Most obviouslyJollas platform getsanother string to its bowto make the most of the small tablet form factor  so there are thoughtfultouches such asa Qwerty keyboard that splits into two in landscape orientation so that you can type with two thumbs without having to put the slate down; and a customizable quick settings bar located a swipe away from the homescreen, next to Jollasaggregated notificationsfeed.There are also some themed modes whichcan be toggled viaa down-swipe fromthe top of the screen. Here you can, for instance, switch between a work set up of the tabletwithapps like email and calendar foregrounded, to an after hours view with the daily grind tucked out of sight.But by far the biggest upgrade with Sailfish 2.0is how Jolla haspared back and simplified Sailfishs gesture basedUI. This is a key change.of Jollas smartphone had identified aproblematic learning curve and sometimes confusing navigation.Andwhile Jolla has touted Sailfishsnewness and otherness as a core part of its differentiation mission, to offer choice ina marketplace dominated by Android and iOS, italso needs to offersomething people are comfortable using.Jolla has clearly been listening and is now iterating. Sailfish 2.0 pares interactionsback to a few core gestures, such as swiping up anywhere to get to all apps, or a side swipe to peek at or go back to the homescreen. Its also possible to continuously swipe to cycle through the various content screens.Meanwhile actions supported bythe application covers  aka the small cards representingopen/live appson the Sailfish homescreen  have also been simplified, so they areless matryoshka-like in terms of what users can do with them.In short, Jolla seems to have realised that less is more  and difference shouldnt bedifficult.This is definitely progress.Ithas also added a new contentscreen to Sailfish 2.0 that can be swiped in from the homescreen which its calling a partner space.Its demoing this with Deezer on the tablet, as as example, but does not yet have any partners to announce. Its had something similar onitssmartphone, offering, for instance. Atablet-based partner space is obviously more generously proportionedthan what can fit on a smartphone  and cancontaina whole carousel of content.Jolla is very eager to take industrial partners right now, said Dillon, discussing how its hoping thepartner space feature will spark more industry interest in its platform and hardware.Maybe I would like to buy a package from myoperator or a retailer that includes the service, the cellular service ordata, thatalso includes my favoritecontent packages, also includesthe device, so we can bundle all of those togethers and give a premium place onthe UI thats right next to the homescreen where my favorite application, favorite content, favorite service bundle is always right available.Dillon saidSailfish 2.0will be rolling out whenthe tablet launches  likely at the end ofQ2 this year. The 2.0 update also brings stability and core performance improvements to itsplatform (I think were doing Android better than Android does now, with the multitasking and the multiple windows), along with support for Intel CPUs, which will expand the device types Sailfish can reach.Who has beenpre-ordering the Jolla tablet sofar? Backers are really varied, according toDillon. The biggest group were people who wanted to see something that was independent.That was actually the number one reason that people backed us, he said, adding: About half of the people had an existing tablet so they were wanting to replace an existing tablet.Only about around half had a Jolla phone, so we did have a lot of people that came out of the box to get this device.This seemed to be a verygood fit for us, he added, talking about the decision to make a tablet. You have to move your whole life to a mobile phone so a tablet is more of an elective kind of purchase. A lot of people use them to either consume content, or to work, or to communicate.This is the first Sailfish tablet. This is the first tablet that doesnt have an American operating system. Its the first tablet thats not dominated by a one company strategy.While Sailfish is built on an open source core, the Sailfish UI itself remains proprietary. But Jolla is aiming to move in a fully open sourceddirection  hence its call for more partners to join theSailfish Alliance.Intel and SSH Communications are the first two its talking about  the latter helping it build a forthcoming hardened version of the OS, called .I definitely envisage it in the future to be fully open source. At the moment Sailfish is not. Its powered by open. We work in the open in a lot of places, he said. When we work with our partners we can give them the source code to absolutely everything. So thats one huge advantage Getting fully open is going to require this Sailfish Alliance, so getting some more companies and partners on board. Then we can basically release everything.What we dont want is any single points of control. We want a group of companies that come together, that co-operate, that maybe have different agendas, maybe are even in some kinds of competition with each other, but can leverage one platform in order to do that  instead of closing down the walls and saying this is our strategy and were going to go as hard as we can until we fall.

The companys latest premier smartphones are mostly similar on the inside, but with different external body designs, both of which push the envelope in terms of what Samsung has done with its Galaxy lineup in the past.The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge combine metal and glass, eschewing almost entirely the standard plastic setup that Samsung has show a preference before in previous smartphone designs. A metal frame runs throughout, sandwiched between two panes of durable Gorilla Glass 4, which has also been treated on the inside with a special reflective material coating, giving them a jeweled-metal look that explains why some early leaks made it seem like Samsung had opted for metallic rear casing surfaces.While both are marked departures for Samsung, the Galaxy S6 edge may be its most ambitious design to date, with a screen that curves away on either side of the front of the device, and a subtler, matching curve on the back surface, too. The effect is both visually stunning and pleasant to hold, as you can read in .Of course, the S6 lineup also boasts improved specs, including a slimmer and lighter design, compared to the S5 and older Galaxy hardware. Heres a breakdown of the primary improvements:Specs never tell the full story, and Samsung has done plenty more to try to make this a significant flagship reboot inside and out. The f/1.9 aperture on those front and back cameras should translate to improved low-light function on each, and the auto HDR and image stabilization options also help contribute to the goal of making it much easier for device owners to snap great pics. Samsung has also added a feature whereby double pressing the home button launches the camera instantly, in what it claims is just 0.7 seconds, no matter where you happen to be or from device lock. A subject lock borrowed from the NX-1 dedicated Samsung camera lets you continually autofocus on a specific subject, too.As rumored, the phonealso has embedded wireless charging tech, which includes support for both WPC and PMA standards, meaning you can use it with Starbucks, as well as with the more prevalent Qi-enabled home chargers. Samsung is also going to sell its own charging pucks, of course, and on the power front theyve also upped wired charging by a factor of 1.5x, meaning you should get around 4 hours-worth of battery out of 10 minutes of plugged-in charging.Theres no swappable memory card support, but the new UFS 2.0 tech Samsung used for its internal flash memory is much faster than any external card or previous internal storage, the company says, and it now offers that 128GB option for those who need ore space, as well as cloud services for remote storage.Samsung has also redone the fingerprint scanner in the home button so that you no longer have to swipe, and theyre going to use that with the launch of their Samsung Pay tech coming later this year. Finally, theyve lightened up their approach to skinning Android (UI add-ons removed by 40 percent, in fact, according to Samsung), and dont even mention the word TouchWiz anywhere, which is great news.The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge go on sale starting April 10 in markets around the world, with White Pearl, Black Sapphire, and Gold Platinum color options for both, plus a special Blue Topaz for the Galaxy S6, and Green Emerald reserved for the Galaxy S6 edge.

(The company has previously confirmed a Blackphone tablet is also incoming.)For its part Geeksphone has various other sole hardwareprojectsto keep it occupied post-Blackphone, including its , and other(albeit sales of devices runningMozillas mobile platform are inevitably niche). Its latest direction is a move into wearables, with coming this summer.In May last year Silent Circle took in its first ever external funding, a led by investors including . and Dallas-based private investment fund Cain Capital LLC, thanks (it said) to demand for Blackphone, whichruns ahardened Android fork called PrivatOS. So its investors are also evidently persuaded there isa sizable opportunity to capitalize on BlackBerrys fall from favor.Add to that, there is generally growing momentum for more secure mobile communications, as security continues to rise up corporate agendas in the wake of high profile leaks such as the hacking of Sony Pictures email last year.Just it emerged that government intelligence agencies might havecracked encryption keys in SIM cards distributed by Gemalto  according to documents released by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden  blowing a huge security hole in mobile voice communications.Commenting in a statement, Silent Circle investor,As the nature and volume of data breaches increase, institutional trust is eroding, he said. There are companies that have been hacked and there are those that dont know about it yet, which means that security in the traditional sense has failed us. With the number of employees connecting to an enterprises network using their own devices rapidly rising, organizations need a different solution.This first stage of growth has enabled us to raise approximately $50m to accelerate our continued rapid expansion and fuel our second stage of growth, addedMike Janke, co-Founder and executive chairman of the Silent Circle Board, in another statement.Just under a year ago, we introduced Blackphone at Mobile World Congress. Since then, weve continued to develop new, privacy-first products for our integrated software suite as well as Blackphone, the first hardware device in our portfolio of privacy solutions.Its unclear whether Geeksphone will continue to manufacture hardware under license to SGP Technologies. Weve put the question to the company, and will likely get more details in Barcelona on Monday  when Silent Circle is holding a Blackphone-related press conference.", "title": "With $50M Boost, Silent Circle Aims Blackphone At EnterpriseSecurity"},

The smart ropes, as theyre being called, are designed more for those who use a jump rope during their gym workouts rather than children who jump just for fun.The first project is , the smart skipping rope, which offers a Bluetooth-connected jump rope that includes an activity tracker that can measure your jumps, speed and calories. This data is synced to an accompanying iPhone or Android application, where you can track your progress or even challenge friends or others remotely to beat your records.The technology that makes the rope smart is hidden in the handles, which contain three fitness sensors including a triaxial accelerometer, infrared module and an optical module that counts your jump cycles. An integrated OLED display on the handles themselves will also show the jump count as well as the battery indicator.The company claims its battery will last up to one month  which, if accurate, makes the product more compelling than a number of fitness trackers which have to be charged with far more frequency. (Often, the frustrations around charging end up seeing users abandon their wearables after the initial interest wears off.)The Sophia ropes handles, when placed together, are held together via magnetsso the rope can be easily stored in your gym bag, taking up little space. Meanwhile, when pulled apart, the handles have a rubberized cashing and ergonomic grip to make jumping rope easier.What makes Sophia interesting, however, is itsgamified approach to fitness. In the accompanying mobile app, you can choose between games like the time challenge or jump countdown in order to compete againstfriends or other remote Sophia users. These challenge invites come in as push notifications which you can then accept or decline right from your phone.Sophia is where its wrapping up a fundraising campaign. To date, it has raised24,937 out of a 28,500 goal. Early birds can score arope for29.00 ($34.00 US) and up, with an expected shipping timeframeof May 2015. The upgraded leather rope, pictured above, is $50.But Sophia is only one variation on the smart rope. Another company is making its Kickstarter debut on Wednesday with . Like Sophia, its rope works alongside aSmart Gym mobile application which tracks how many jumps youve completed and how many calories youve burned. While the focus here is less on gaming, the app does include a virtual trainer function which lets you set fitness goals and track your progress, as well as share that progress with friends or compete with them on Facebook.But whatmakes thisunique is not the social element.Instead of just showing a small jump counter on the handles, the Smart Rope uses 23 LED lights thatactually display your jump count in mid-air while youre in motion. The display can show up to four digits, and can also be toggled to show how many calories youre burning, if you prefer a different sort of motivation.The company behind the Smart Rope, , was one of Samsungs vendors in designing itsSmart TV experience, and has shippedother products in the past, including remote controls, phone cases and more, making it a slightly safer betthat its rope will launch, assuming it meets its fundraising goal of $60,000.The rope itself is placed at a 45-degree angle to the handle, and is on ball bearings for a smooth, extremely responsive feel,the company says. Meanwhile, inside the rope there are multiple magnetic sensors housed in the handle, with a full revolution that register the actual jumps.The company says it didnt want to use gyroscopic sensors that monitor generic movement because those sensors are already in your smartphone and in most wearables.Tangram has developed the prototype for its Smart Rope already, and will use the funds it raises to take the rope into production.Tangram says the rope will sell on Kickstarter for $60, with price reductions for those who buy in bulk. The campaign begins on Wednesday, and retail pricing has not been set at this time.", "title": "Two Companies Are Adding Smarts To The Classic JumpRope"},

The patent is for a small form factor telephoto camera (via ) and describes how the company might make a camera with a narrower field of view, but a much higher magnification factor, as well ashow such a camera might be paired with a wider angle unit like the one thats already usedin your current iPhone to give you a range of options on a single smartphone device.The patent describes the mechanics behind creating a small lens suitable for use in a device like the iPhone, or the iPad and mobile Macs. In one version, the small camera would be built in such a way that you could adjust zoom using different focal ratios for true optical magnification. Apples current iPhone camera uses digital zoom, but this results in far more degradation of quality versus true optical magnification like those found in DSLRtelephoto lenses, and compact cameras with traditional zoom lenses.Apples patent application document mostly dives into the nitty gritty around how it would achieve different magnifications and what materials it would use, along with specific dimensions needed to construct the proper lenses involved in the system.The most interesting piece may be that Apple includes a provision that would allow this new telephoto lens to be used right alongside the kind of general-purpose, wide-angle camera thats currently found in the iPhone, which gives a much more expanded field of view suitable to more general everyday photography.The patent application is a relatively new one,firstfiled in October 2013. On paper, it seems like a very worthwhile thing to pursue for Apple, since it would provide a significant lead in the mobile photography arena where it already has a reputation for outshining its competitors.Two factors that might affect whether or not we ever see it actually implemented include component cost, and space within the case. Heres hoping they do eventually ship it, orsomething like it, since built-in telephoto would pretty much eliminate any need I have to carry a dedicated camera.", "title": "Apple Looking Into Built-In Telephoto iPhone CameraLenses"},

Its target age group is 8- to 12-year-oldsThe $150+ Codie bot takes the form of a wheeled vehiclethat can perform a variety of actionsandreactions, thanks toseven on-board sensors  including a temperature sensor, ultrasound distance sensor, light sensors, and a line tracking sensor plus a buzzer, microphone and LED lights. The bots functions are designed to beconfigured via the companion iOS and Android apps, using a Bluetooth link between bot and app, so kids can make Codie move and respond to itsenvironment.The Hungarian team behindCodie, which is raising crowdfunds on to get theirgizmo to market, is following in the connected footsteps of the likes of, , andto name a few learn-to-code toys of recent years. Theres also the that lets kids put together their own computer and then use it to play games and learn how to tweak the code to get a sense for programming. (As a sign of the kind of critical mass this category is seeing, .)Codies makers reckon they can still stand out thanks to the effort theyre putting into their proprietary visual programing language, which does not require any compiling time so allows kids to play around with coding and see actions in real-time. The touchscreen softwarealso has a focus on gestures to helpkids feel engaged withthe visual coding process.We designed it from the ground up with a few clear principles in our head, the startuptells TechCrunch. It should be intuitive, it should get the most out of the touchscreen and it should follow kids thinking and imagination. This is the first language developed with these goals in mind. We created several custom controls (eg. when setting the color on the top LED ring, kids dont have to define it with RGB codes,but they just simply set the color with a visual color ring in the app), and users can create programs without even opening the keyboard.Were integrating a number of coding elements into the Codie application. Conditionals, like if-else structures and programming loops are already present. For example, using these two structures, you can create a program which we like to call the Roomba. Codie gets info from the ultrasonic distance sensor and makes a decision, if theres nothing in front of it, then Codie continues along the path, if theres something, then it makes a turn to avoid collision. If you loop this decide process, then Codie will constantly avoid bumping into other objects.The team is also intending to create a cloud community where Codie users can share their programs with other kidsto expand the learning environment.To help kids develop beyond graphical programming they are also planning to offer a feature where kids can convert their Codie programs into JavaScript.After editing the JS code, they can convert it back to the Codie interface they are already familiar with, and they can examine the changes they made in the JS code. From that point, if someone wants to be a programmer, they can learn specific programming knowledge, butthey dont have to learn the programming patterns, only the specific syntax of the programming language of choice, it adds.At the time of writing, Codie still has to hit its $70,000 crowdfunding goal to fund manufacturing and software dev costs. If it does, its aiming to ship bots to backers by November. However the startuphas already taken in a chunk offinancing, with a $125,000 investmentfromHungarian investor iCatapult, back in February 2014, anda further $10,000 from an angel investor.

When you push a button or twist a knob, the acoustrument modifies the tone much in the way your finger changes the tone of a flute when it blocks a hole. Push the button, the air pathway changes, the tone changes accordingly. Your phones microphone detects the tone change and reacts accordingly.Why? Imagine an alarm clock that works with any phone, as long as it has a microphone/speaker on the bottom. Or, as demonstrated, a Google Cardboard-esque virtual reality headset with buttons that work with just about any phone, all without power/wires.Like much of what comes out of Disneys research labs, this was built in partnership with Carnegie Mellon.Is it 100 percent practical in all cases?

Think Wile E. Coyote and an ACME Human Cannon. BOOM!The basic idea of the USB drive is quite simple. When we connect it up to the USB port, an inverting DC/DC converter runs and charges capacitors to -110V. When the voltage is reached, the DC/DC is switched off. At the same time, the filed transistor opens. It is used to apply the -110V to signal lines of the USB interface. When the voltage on capacitors increases to -7V, the transistor closes and the DC/DC starts. The loop runs till everything possible is broken down. Those familiar with the electronics have already guessed why we use negative voltage here. Ill explain to others that negative voltage is easier to commutate, as we need the N-channel field resistor, which, unlike the P-channel one, can have larger current for the same dimensions.Put simply, the bits inside the USB drive draws and stores a ton of power. When a certain level is hit, it returns the power to the source, which is either a dedicated USB controller or the CPU itself. This is bad news bears. The amount of power returned overloads the circuits, rendering it useless. Since a lot of USB controllers are built directly into the main processor bye bye computer.Scary.

Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that HBOs new standalone streaming service called HBO Now is going to be available on Apple TV, exclusively at launch.The service will include all access to current programming as well as past programming, and popular shows like Game of Thrones and Silicon Valley were mentioned as coming to the service when it debuts next month. The audience at the event also got a sneak peek at the forthcoming season of Game of Thrones, introduced by HBOs CEORichard Plepler who called HBOs new streaming service a transformative moment for his company.The service will resemble the companys current mobile offering HBO GO, except that it will no longer require users to also have a cable TV or satellite subscription. Instead, theyll have the option to pay directly.HBO Now will be sold in the U.S. for $14.99 a month, starting in April  just in time for the return of Game of Thrones. The first month will be free, in order to attract potential customers. iOS device owners, including iPad and iPhone owners, will be able to access the new subscription service through the HBO app on the App Store. In addition,subscribers will also be able to watch at HBONOW.com.All you need to get HBO Now is a broadband connection and an Apple device, saidPlepler. There will be a brand-new HBO Now channel on Apple TV so you can enjoy it on the big screen or you can watch HBO NOW on your iPhones and iPads.The fact that this is exclusive to Apple TV is surprising, and will likely sell a lot of Apple TVs. It also speaks to a sizable deal between the two companies, Apple and HBO, the latter which could have easily brought this technology to other set-top box platforms but chose to launch the service exclusively with Apple TV instead. , Apples exclusive on HBO Now is limited, however  it has a three-month window among new digital distributors.Apple, which has sold 25 million Apple TVs to date, noted also theres another reason to buy Apple TV  Apple TV will reinvent the way that you watch television, and this is just the beginning, said Cook.Unfortunately, the CEO didnt also introduce a revamped Apple TV platform, as some had expected.that Apple was working on a slimmer design for its set-top box with an improved and more tactile remote control and redesigned operating system, which is included an App Store.Below, HBOs video introducing the new HBO Now service:", "title": "HBOs New Streaming Service, HBO Now, Exclusive To Apple AtLaunch"},

The company will use the funding to help deliver its , which raised over $820,000 on Kickstarter last year, to its first customers starting this spring. The funding will help the startup overcome some of the challenges it encountered going from concept to full production in Taiwan, and set the company up for future growth plans, which include becoming category leaders in bike-based software.Vanhawks co-founder Ali Zahid explained in an interview that the startup wasnt surprised that it needed morefunds to start shipping over and above what it raised on Kickstarter, since they were first-time entrepreneurs and didnt know exactly what to expect when it came time for actual production and manufacturing. Despite missing their initial launch target of late last year for shipping the first Valour bikes out to Kickstarter backers, Zahid says theyre pleased with how things are going now and will start shipping in batches of 25 to 50 bikes at a time this spring, with the intent of working through the backlog by this summer and then offering two- to three-week delivery times on new orders. The funding also helps with the companys long-term strategy, which extends beyond making bikes.The vision is a lot bigger than just making bikes, Zahid explains. Think of us as the software layer for the bike industry of the future. Everyone says that software is eating the world, and we see that in the bike industry, too, which hasbeen sitting in the past.Zahid thinks this is the right time for someone (ideally Vanhawks) to emerge as the connected pioneer for the biking industry, which he expects to explode in the coming years. He points out that in Europe and elsewhere in the world, bikes are an incredibly popular mode of transportation, and he expects that adoption of bikes in North America will grow to match. Biking among city-dwellers has been on the rise in North America among commuters, especially , so in urban centers at least Vanhawks has a growing user base to target.The Valour will showcase what Vanhawks software can offer bikes in terms of software, showcasing built-in turn-by-turn and blind spot detection, as well as speed tracking, road condition reports, distance and elevation, all of which helps serve a Waze-like crowdsourced route planning service for fellow bike commuters. The software also enables anti-theft tracking measures, which helps to alleviate a primary concern especially among riders who invest considerable money, time and effort into their bicycles.I like biking, and while part of the reason I like it is because it requires my full attention and essentially ensures that I cant be glued to some kind of data feed, I see plenty of opportunity for passive data gathering that can better equip a future of connected two-wheel commuters. The Valour is cool, but long-term, as with most tech startups, the data will probably be the biggerstory here.", "title": "Vanhawks Raises $1.6M To Help Put The Valour Smartbike On TheRoad"},

The new fund includes a contribution of $300 million, or just under half the total value, from Google, which marks its largest clean energy investment to date, and helps make this the biggest fund of its kind in existence.Typically, installation costs associated with making an individual household able to harvest and use its own solar power are very high, meaning they take many years to recoup for the homeowners funding the installations. That means theres a high barrier preventing many from taking advantage, especially if homeowners think they might have cause to move before they make their money back on the initial build.The new $750 million fund is designed to help thousands of homeowners defray those setup costs, covering the cost of installation, solar panels, and equipment. In exchange, homeowners pay SolarCity for the energy produced by their panels, or a monthly rent fee for the panels in a lease situation, similar to the arrangement theyd have with a typical utility company, but with cleaner energy, and, in most cases, lower costs, too.This is the second time Google and SolarCity have teamed up in this way; back in 2011, Google to a similar fund with the aim of getting thousands of homeowners on board with solar power.

Pressing the Netflix or Amazon Instant Video shortcuts on the included remote instantly brings up the corresponding app, not the logo and a loading animation as you might see on other set-top boxes. Its a vastly superior experience if youre moving up from an older Roku or a competitor whose hardware hasnt gotten an upgrade in a few years (looking at you, Apple TV).Speaking of the remote, theres an embedded microphone at the top that lets you search for shows, movies, and new channels with your voice. Thats now the default option when you tap the remotes search button, and in most cases its more convenient than manually entering keys (if you can annunciate clearly and in an accent it can parse, of course). Some searches I tried gave it some problems  the Roku had trouble understanding TechCrunch today and in my demo last week, and would work for The Avengers but not Avengers in my tests this morning.Aside from voice search, the other big software feature to arrive with the new boxes is Roku Feed, which lets you follow movies to get updates when they hit new services or drop in price. For now the feed is focused on movies that just hit theaters so you can know when theyre available for streaming, but eventually Roku hopes youll fill it in with all of your favorite films so you can see them at their cheapest.At $99, the Roku 3 is still a premium option in the video streaming hardware space.

Its a ready-to-fly quadcopter that combines everything the company has learned from its earlier products  and those of its competitors  into a single platform. With the Solo, 3DR also offers a new level of customer support that is pretty much unrivaled in the industry.Unlike almost allof its competitors, the Solo can get video right from any modern GoPro camera (starting with the Hero3+) and streams it directly to your phone ortablet with the help of 3DRs new (and optional) 3-axis Solo gimbal.The new dronelaunches only a week after 3DRs largest competitor, DJI, launched the . But while the new Phantom is a clear upgrade fromits predecessors, the 3DRmay just have leapfrogged it in a couple of areas.As 3DR Chief Revenue Officer Colin Guinn told me, the companys focus while developing the Solo was to prioritize the user experience. He wanted the Soloto be great for prosandeasy to fly for beginners  all with a focus on aerial photography.To do so, 3DR rewrote its old mobile apps to make them much easier to use, but it also built new smarts into both the drone and the controller.Whats maybe more important than any of the technical features that come with theSolo today is that 3DR is looking at this as a platform that is meant to be updatable and extensible.The maximum flight time for the Solo is about 20 minutes with a camera and gimbal underneath it and 25 minutes without them.Thanks to the companys partnership with GoPro, pilotscan now use their GoPros and start streaming video from them right to their phones, just like you can with the built-in cameras in DJIs or s latest drones.The Solos completely redesigned controller features a small display that shows battery life and other vital information, but it also has an HDMI output, so you could even stream livevideo from the drone right to a large screen or first-person video goggles. The maximum WiFi range for receiving video is about half a mile. Thats less than some of 3DRs competitors and this may be a letdown for some potential users, but its enough for manytypical use cases.To enable video from the camera, 3DR had to work closely with GoPro, Guinn told me. This ability to directly control the GoPro also means you can now start and stop video recordings at will when the drone is in the air. Previously, you had to start the recording on the ground and hope that your video would turn out well  something I also dinged 3DRs Iris+ for in my .The Solo features most of the automatic modes from 3DRs previous drones, including the ability to have the drone orbit around a spot, follow you around or fly a preset track. But the company also learned from how its customersuse these features. You can now, for example, create a track by flying the drone to a number of spots that you want to capture in your video, set those spots as waypoints in the app and then have the drone smoothlyretrace this route This way, you can easily script out your pathand then get exactly the shot you were looking for.The Solo, of course, also comes withall of the standard convenience features users now expect from their drones, including automatic takeoffs and landings and a return to home feature in case something goes wrong.On the technical side, the Solo now features a 1 GHz ARM Cortex A9 processor in the drone as well as an identical processor in the controller. The Solo also features 3DRs new Pixhawk 2 autopilot, but because a lot of the computation now happens on the processor, the autopilot doesnt actually have all that much to do until the user asks it to kick in or something goes wrong. When the computer has to reboot for some reason, for example, the autopilot can keep it in place or  in case the computer doesnt boot up again  fly the drone back to its launch point.Unlike virtually every other drone, updates to the drones firmware can be installed wirelessly, putting an end to complex  and often error prone  updates. Also new and unique to the Solo is the top-loading battery that makes replacing the battery a snap.3DR looks at the solo as a platform. One feature that I think is especially promising is that the Solo has an accessory bay. This means third-party developers can easily create new hardware that can be attached to the drone. 3DR itself will soon launch a Lidar camera for the Solo, for example, that will make it easier to fly the drone indoors. Guinn also told me that the company is thinking about other tools like a ballistic parachute system or an LED lighting system for the Solo.In addition, the Solo can also take third-party gimbals, of course, but it also features easily swappable motor pods. So when you motors break for some reason, itll be easy to replace them or to upgrade them with more powerful ones at some point in the future.As Guinnnoted, its these kind of convenience, safety and platform features that make the Solo stand out, but 3DR has also decided to back its new product with a pretty unconventional guarantee.The Solo can log its flight data in the controller instead of just on the drone itself (having a data log on the drone, after all, isnt all that useful when you experience a fly-awayand your $1,000 machine lands in a lake). Whenever something goes wrong and your drone crashes, 3DRs support team can look at your flight data and if it turns out the crash wasnt the pilots fault, the company will replace or repair the drone and gimbal free of charge, as well as provide the owner with a discount coupon for a new GoPro.If you ignore your low battery warning or manually fly the Solo into a tree, you are obviously on your own, but having this kind of support  as well as a 30-day money-back guarantee  is something new in the world of consumer drones.The Solo will cost $999 without the gimbal. It will go on sale in the U.S. in May and globally in June and July. 3DR has set up partnerships with large retailers like Best Buy and B&H in the U.S., as well as numerous other camera and electronics retailers. The Solo Gimbal will be sold separately for $399.", "title": "3D Robotics New Solo Drone Promises To Make Aerial VideographyEasy"},

The original campaign, then resulted in only 11.6 percent fewer total hardware orders, despite earning 65.8 percent less money.The starting price point for the new Pebble Time was higher, and the average selling price of the gadget was much higher overall thanks to the availability of Pebble Time Steel as an option during the same campaign. But in the end, Pebble Times campaign indicates that demand for actual devices may not have leapt ahead between now and the Pebbles original introduction by all that much (though Pebble had 6 more days during its campaign than Pebble Time during which to draw backers).Given that the Apple Watch event occurred during Pebble Times campaign and led to a big increase in pledge volume, its hard to say what this might mean for Pebble Time hardware sales post-campaign.

In the demo given to the press at CES this year, the PC that powered the demo included an nVidia GTX 980, a $600 graphics card.Regarding the price, Mitchell said Oculus wants the Rift to be affordable, but admitted its positioned as a high-end experience that will cost significantly more than the Samsung Gear VR mobile headset that Oculus helped build and release last year.Mitchell explainedOverall when we look at VR we see two product categories, the high end that will be represented by the Rift and the low end represented by our collaboration with Samsung.Right now, the Oculus-built Samsung Gear VR costs $200. Thats on top of the phone that powers it  which generally cost $649 or more.As for how people will buy the Rift, Mitchell said retail willplay a big part according to Oculus VP of Product Nate Mitchell.We will probably take [pre-orders] on Oculus.com, but retail is going to be a big part of our strategy, Mitchell noted during his interview at Disrupt NY this morning. So far buying it has been about trial, you put it on and youre transported to another place.That experience is going to be vital to getting hundreds of millions of people to adopt it.He wouldnt go into more detail than that, but couldnt suppress a smile when interview moderator Josh Constine brought up the idea of trial stations at retailers like Best Buy.If the Crescent Bay demo at CES was any indication, the consumer Rift will feature graphics that would make a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One owner envious, so one would assume that the rig to power it (the Rift will not function as a standalone device in its first generation) will require more than just a high-end CPU  youll need a GPU that can handle high resolutions, large textures, high frame rates, and effects like shaders.Luckily, there will be some awesome games available day one for the Oculus Rift, Mitchell says. Thats because Oculus has quietly begun building its own games. While it previewed an experimental in-house title called Hero Bound , Mitchell revealed that Oculus has several small teams building first-party titles. It will also publish second-party titles built by outside developers, and allow third-party titles created entirely independently of Oculus on its platform.That doesnt mean there will be half-baked apps on the Rift. Games that are too shocking or nauseating could scare people away from virtual reality.Mitchell says that Oculus wants to make sure it only offers high-quality experiences at first, so expect it to have to review and approve Rift apps before theyre released. The company still values openness in its ecosystem, so it will allow third-party hardware peripherals and controllers to be compatible with the Rift. It will continue open sourcing its technologies when possible to aid developers.Itll be another month until Oculus reveals more at the E3 gaming conference. But if it can release a polished, somewhat affordable headset with great experiences from both inside and outside the company, Oculus could make the sci-fi dream of virtual reality finally come true.", "title": "Oculus Is Building Its Own Games For Rift, But Youll Need A Computer ToPlay"},

While weve gotten used to plugging in our phones, tablets and laptops when they need topping off, the addition of one more gadget is apparently a bridge too far.Of course, one way to reduce the hassle of having that extra device to deal with as you get your gadgets ready for the next day is to make charging all ofthem a single process.Some people do this by creating a designated charger space in their home  a kitchen counter, a desk that isnt used for work very often  and bringing all of their gadgets to that spot to charge at the end of the day.

When you first get the station, you have to slide a Lightning cable through the dock to get the charger setup. Same thing for the Watchs charger cable. But once youve done that, you can just drop your devices on the stand when its time to charge for the day  the dock supports any iPhone case and the Apple Watchs inductive charging means you wont need to fiddle with lining up the cable with a tiny micro-USB port as with some Android Wear watches.In addition to the power station itself, the NuDock comes with the NuKi, a 2,000 mAh portable battery you can carry with you to keep your phone topped off over the course of a long weekend or a day of intense usage. On top of the sheer utility of a keychain battery, it also has some nifty smart features  you can use it to findthe keys its attached to from an app on your phone, and use a button on the side to control the shutter in your camera app from a distance.The NuDock is set to ship in July, so youll have to go a few months without one after receiving your Apple Watch.

For the first time, our species could leverage the Earths magnetic fields and use them to help us be better at life.The development of extra-sensory devices accelerated after the scientific revolution and took off with the discovery of electromagnetic waves and the subsequent development of radio. With radio, not only did we figure out how to broadcast electromagnetic frequencies, we built the technology necessary to manipulate them as sound.But the first massive step towards the development of an external sixth sense in humans happened in 2007, when Steve Jobs got on stage at Macworld and ushered in the modern smartphone era.Combine the smartphones core capabilities with push notifications, the right dataset, and the software necessary to turn raw data into useful information in real time, and that becomes the recipe for a powerful sixth sense.Think of it as a richer ambient awareness of the world, mediated by the Internet and a smart device.In other words, your phone + the Internet + the right software work together to sense the data permeating your environment and deliver this data to you as information with a push notification. The result is a vibration you feel or an auditory alert you hear.To make this concrete, consider Foursquare, Facebook and Google Now.For all of its long-standing struggles for stickiness among consumers, Foursquare has used check-ins to build the worlds richest, more accurate online database of physical locations.When you sign up for the latest version of the app, Foursquare also encourages you to give it data about your favorite foods and activities.This way, when you venture near a restaurant that serves your preferred foods, a bar that specializes in your favorite cocktails, or any other real-world location that offers something youd probably enjoy, Foursquare sends you a push notification to let you know.To pull this off, Foursquare combines its databases, GPS info coming from your phone, and its unique algorithms to tell you things you might not know about the world around you. It does all of this in real time without you having to ask.The result is a digitally enhanced sense of the brick-and-mortar world.Though there are weaknesses in Facebooks data and current algorithms that limit the features utility, Nearby Friends is a concept with potential: If Facebook had a better understanding of our relationships, it could tell us when our close friends were nearby and what theyre up to at the time.It would get really interesting (and a lot more intrusive) if Facebook figured out how to notify us of interesting people around that we didnt know but would likely benefit from meeting.The result is a digitally enhanced sense of our social environment.If you use Googles services to power most of your digital life, Google Now mines your calendar, your email, your location, your search history, and the time of day to give you all sorts of useful notifications about your world.Got an upcoming meeting and traffic conditions get worse before youre planning to leave? Heres a notification to leave now.Did a package you ordered just go out for delivery? Heres a notification to let you know when to expect it.Depending on your perspective on Googles intentions, you might consider this kind of proactive analysis of your life downright creepy.If it werent so damn useful, you might even get mad.As anyone in a relationship with someone who cant stop checking their phone will tell you, smartphone notifications are a nuisance. A plague, even.This is partly due to the fact that most push notifications were designed explicitly to pull you away from whatever youre doing for the purpose of advancing some form of corporate interest:Buy this! Come back to our app! Check out our latest virtual sword!Indeed, far from being useful, many (if not most), push notifications actually harm us, hooking us on our own dopamine and making us less present and aware of the moments of life passing us by.There is a world where push notifications actually help us live better lives, but were not living in it yet.This all begins to change with the Apple Watch, and its breakthrough taptic engine.In case youre unfamiliar with the concept of the taptic engine, it is the feature of the Apple Watch that taps you on the wrist when a notification comes in.Despite its clunky, overly technical name, the taptic engine is what sets the Apple Watch apart. Without the taptic engine, the Apple Watch is just a beautiful digital trinket. With it, however, the device becomes much more.Because you are wearing the Apple Watch on your body versus carrying it around, the connection its taptic engine creates between your mind and the information from push notifications is dramatically more direct and intimate: Instead of a vibration in your pocket or a distracting auditory alert from your purse, you get a subtle touch on the wrist.Think about this for a minute: A device on your wrist is using a wide range of online datasets and your sense of touch to notify you in real time of things you might otherwise not perceive.The Apple Watch can analyze data from its clock and its accelerometer to tell you when youve been sitting too long.With a little help from another wearable like the or the , it can tell you when your breathing patterns are showing signs of stress or your posture is off.Some of this information just helps you be healthier. Some of it is life and death.If youre diabetic, for example, you can use the Apple Watch with a wearable glucose monitor and get notified of any worrying trends in your blood sugar levels throughout the day.These taptic notifications get even more interesting when third parties with access to unique datasets start exploiting their potential.Imagine youre in a new neighborhood in Kansas City and its lunchtime.As youre walking around, Apple Watch taps you to recommend a nearby restaurant that is renowned for its ribs. As you walk out satisfied with your meal, you get another tap. A good friend is at a coffee shop down the road. You tap your watch and his watch taps him to let him know youre around.As you and your friend meander, the Dark Sky app taps you to tell you that hard rain is imminent. As you consider heading inside, you get a quick set of urgent taps from the National Weather Service. You turn your wrist and glance down to see that a tornado warning is in effect for the next two hours.You get the idea.The downside, as both and have pointed out, is that the Apple Watch opens the floodgates to a never-ending series of taps making insistent demands on your already-overstretched attention.But with some smart, mindful tweaks, you can set up your budding sixth sense to provide useful information instead of meaningless distractions: your Lyft is about to arrive; your heart rate is abnormally fast; your breathing patterns indicate anxiety; you need to take a break and breathe some slow, deep breaths.While the road to the future for humankind is uncertain and full of pitfalls, one things seems likely. If we navigate the next few decades without blowing everything up, our species is set to evolve.Some forecasters think that this evolution will come in the form of a conscious artificial intelligence. I believe that our technology will steadily flow into our biology, and the next generation of humans will be a deeply integrated nexus of man and machine.Along that trajectory, a lot of incredible things will have to go down first, but they are . Eventually, our bodies and minds will be awash with hardware and software that connect us more deeply with the digital world.By the time that happens, the Apple Watch and its breakthrough taptic engine will be a distant memory, like the .But when they look back and talk about how we got from here to there, the Apple Watch and all of its adjacent applications and enabling technologies will be considered a crucial early step.As the Apple Watch, itself, demonstrates, an innate, digitally enabled sixth sense in humans is only a matter of time.", "title": "The Apple Watch Can Be A SixthSense"},

In recent years, the One rangesclean, metallic lines have helped it stand outagainst more plastic-y Android rivals.

The power button has also been moved from the top to the side.There is also a brushed lines texture effect on the back, contrasting with high polished sides.The metalhas a scratch resistant coating.HTC said it is taking inspiration from high end jewelry, such as luxury watches, for its design choices with the M9.There are three color options for the M9: gold (edges) on silver; gunmetal grey ongrey; and gold on gold. The version picturedin this article is the gold-edged silver device.Although the 5 inch display is the same as the M8s pane HTC has also managed to marginally shrink the footprint of the M9, so its slightly smaller thanthe M8 (below left).Another major upgrade is to the camera hardware: theM9 has a beefed up rear lens, with a 20MP lens, toughed withsapphire glass, thatcan record video in 4K.

Ive since gotten a few weeks to play with itand can confirm that its hardware lives up to the crazy QHD+ screen.Like its predecessor, this years Razer Blade packs in a 14-inch, 3200 x 1800 pixel screen. It looks pretty from most angles and can get quite bright, and has a touch screen if youre one of the Windows 8 users who actually takes advantage of touch-friendly menus. Photos and video really pop on the display  its not quite 4K, but considering its already past the point of not being able to discern pixels at reasonable distances, thats not something anyone is going to miss.Of course, what really matters is whether or not the new Blade can actually handle gaming at decent settings at the panels native resolution. The jump up to the Geforce 970M chipset has served the Blade well  I was able to crank graphics up to Ultra on a number of games and maintain 45-60 frames per second, only dipping into settings to turn off anti-aliasing or the highest motion blur settings.Between the new GPU and a mobile Core i7 typically reserved for larger laptops, the Blade is more than just a good gaming machine.If youre the creative type, its also a great device for photo and video editing. Again, that screen really rounds out the package if youre going to use it for either of these.With the exception of the screen, you could say the same thing about the performance of most gaming laptops, as high-end hardware is a prerequisite for the category. So its worth talking about how the Blade manages to stand out in a space where most competitors share the same specs.The cases aluminum body is aggressive on the outside and classy on the inside. The keyboard, trackpad and speakers are laid out similarly to a MacBook Pro. Theres a comfortable amount of space between keys, and you wont accidentally hit the power button when you were going for delete. The trackpad is exceptional for a Windows laptop, with gesture support that doesnt lag or mistake down for up. The left and right mouse buttons below the trackpad dont provide a very satisfying click, but if youre gaming on this thing youll probably use a separate mouse anyway.While the black aluminum looks great when you take it out of the box, oil from your hands really stands out across the Blades surface. It took us a few minutes to scrub down the laptop each time we wanted to take pristine photos, so some may find this annoying.On the part of the outer shell that most people will see, you find two bumps and abright green Razer logo. If youre incredibly self-conscious, be aware that its going to draw attention among a see of flat surfaces and Apple logos. As with the interior of the laptop, be prepared to see fingerprints on the outside of the Blade in most lighting conditions.On the bottom of the laptop, there are long rubber strips keeping the Blade slightly elevated. That leaves room for the two fans to get hot air away from the hardware. During regular use, the Blade is essentially silent  but crank up the graphics on a game from the last few years, and they can get rather loud. As with the meh speakers, I dont expect many gamers to notice, since the kind of people who buy a $2,200 gaming laptop probably have decent headphones for 3D audio or multiplayer communication.Gaming on a laptop has always involved a trade-off between performance and convenience. You could pick up a desktop PC that absolutely crushes the Blade in gaming performance for less, and among laptops, you could get a heavier, uglier beast with better specs and save a few hundred dollars. But some people care about performance aesthetics. For those gamers, the Blade is the best compromise available.", "title": "The New Razer Blade Is The Gaming Laptop ToBeat"},

Quick Read is a new feature that gives you easier-reading notifications at-a-glance, and theres a virtual keyboard that uses Microsofts new Word Flow predictive tech, and voice input via Cortana, though both of these require Windows 8.1 on a companion smartphone device.Microsoft Health gets some updates today, too, including a dashboard for the web that uses data from the Microsoft Band to populate, and HealthVault, and MapMyFitness integrations.", "title": "Microsoft Launches Developer Preview SDK And New Features For MicrosoftBand"},

It also found that theblack Sports band was by far the most popular band option among buyers of both the Sport and Apple Watch lines.When it comes to the case, most consumers opted for the larger 42mm case  whether they were buying an Apple Watch or the Sport edition  with 71 per cent selecting the larger format. (That may indicate that more pre-orderers were men than women, given relative average wrist sizes, but Slices data doesnt confirm either way.)Sport Watch buyers were slightly more likely to choose the smaller 38 mm case witha third (32 per cent) purchasing the smaller version, versus a quarter (24 per cent) of Apple Watch buyers.The data indicates the most popular type of case among early adoptersisthe Space Gray aluminum option, chosen by 40 per cent of pre-orderers; followed by stainless steel (34 per cent); silver aluminum (23 per cent). Least popular: Space Black stainless steel (three per cent).Slice also found that Apple Watch pre-orderers are very engaged and loyal Apple consumers, as you might expect, with 72 per cent of those buying the smartwatch also having purchased another Apple product (iPhone, Apple computer or iPad) in the past two years. While a fifth (21 per cent) had pre-ordered an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus a matter of months ago.Add to that, nearlyathird had purchased two Apple products in the past two years, and 11 per cent had bought all three devices, in addition to their new Apple Watch.Slice also pulled data on sales of , which also went on sale Friday.

Created at Carnegie Mellon University, you can use the system to build 3D models of the world just by waving your phone around an object or scene.The accelerometers, called inertial measurement units, roughly tell the phones software the position of the phone in space. IMUs are very noisy and rarely usable to truly assess a phones actual orientation with any degree of real accuracy but coupled with the camera you can get far more useful results.Weve been able to get accuracies with cheap sensors that we hadnt imagined, said Simon Lucey, associate research professor in the CMU Robotics Institute in a release. With a face tracker program, we are able to measure the distance between a persons pupils within half a millimeter. Such measurements would be useful for applications such as virtual shopping for eyeglass frames.The tool allows for better computer vision and could mean that you could create a 3D model of almost anything with your smartphone alone. The researchers expect to use this in self-driving cars, bypassing expensive and power-hungry radar. The team used the technology to create something called Smart Fit that finds the perfect glasses frames for your face.The trajectory we create with these cheap IMUs will drift over time, but the vision element we create is very accurate, said Lucey. So we can use the 3-D model to correct for the errors caused by the IMU, even as we use the IMU to estimate the dimensions of the model.", "title": "You Can Now Use Your Cellphone As A 3D ModelingTool"},

Will Apple Watch owners actually be interested in reading news, shopping or playing tiny games, or will the Watch serve its customers better when it fades into the background, allowing you to pay at checkout, hotel room doors, andonly alerting you when it has something really important to share?While its too soon to say how consumers will embrace this new platform, we do have some early insights into how developers have approached the Apple Watch, according to new data from app store analytics firm .Apple said that the Apple Watch was launching with over 3,000 applications that work on the device, but App Annie has pegged that number more exactly to be 3,061 as of yesterdays count  which the firm notes is a healthy start for the new wearable.Also interesting is that a significant portion of apps have been designedexclusively for the Apple Watch.The majority of Watch apps are the result of developers who extended their existing iOS applications to include Watch support, of course, but App Annie tracked 889 apps  or 29% of the total sample  built just for the Watch. The company said it was able to infer this from the fact that the first version of the app was developed in the last two weeks, which is a fairly reliable means to determining which apps were designed with the new smartwatch in mind.Some developers are hoping that including support for the new Watch will also help them be better discovered in App Store searches as well, as new device owners seek out apps that can translate to their wrist. 10% of the Watch apps live now (or 311 apps), currently include the word Watch in their apps name in order to help consumers through the sorting process, App Annie found.As to what sort of apps developers are building, its not entirely surprising to find the community gravitating toward the kind of apps that help users get things accomplished. After all, the Watch is often thought of as a functional, enabling technology rather than a distraction, the way smartphones have become.The leading category with the most Apple Watch apps is the Utility category, App Annie says, with 12% (373 total) apps.What is perhaps more interesting is that many developers are betting that users will eventually began to goof off with their fancy wrist-wear: Games comprise 10% of the total App Watch apps built to date.Following Games are Productivity apps (8%), Lifestyle apps (7%), thenHealth &Fitness apps (also 7%). Those top five categories out of the 22 total categories live at launch represent a combined 46% of all Apples Watch apps. For comparisons sake, Catalogs and Books have less than 20 apps. Clearly developers dont believe these sorts of apps make sense on the small screen. (Id have to agree.) Meanwhile, Weather, Photo & Video, and Medical apps are also on the lower end at 2% and under.The Medical category would have some overlap with Health & Fitness apps  so if you combined the two categories, it would indicate a larger preference among the developer community to focus on the health aspects to Apples newwearable device.The real question now is what apps will users actually download from these categories, once their Apple Watch arrives? And how many of those apps will be deleted after the initial buzz of trying new app experiences wears off?

The three sensors would each capture a separate color component, as divided by a special light-splitting cube that would divide up light entering the camera into red, green and blue (or other color set) wavelengths.Why? Better resolution and lower noise since they dont need special filters or algorithms to separate out the color information of a captured image on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Using this tech, Apple would potentially be able to boost the image quality of its mobile cameras, especially in video capture scenarios.This would be a much more expensive technology to implement vs. current iPhone camera arrays, and its component parts would likely also take up more space inside the case, something Apple typically wants to avoid. But more accurate colors and better low-light performance might balance out those downsides, depending on how much Apple can minimize the parts required.Apple has been pushing its camera tech further with each successive generation of the iPhone, making sure that it remains generally considered among the best smartphone cameras available.

As with Apples other Made for programs, however, including Made for iPhone (MFI), it will be making sure that after-market add-ons not of its own making match certain standards. MFI certification can be tricky to get, especially now that Apple supplies all Lightning connector components complete with embedded chips for use in MFI devices.In this case, Apple is offering lug components to manufactures optionally, along with the option to build the parts themselves, using an extremely limited specific-use, non-transferable license. Its likely Apples standards will be high when it comes to lugs created by third-parties versus those its supplying itself, but its unclear what the relative cost advantages or hindrances might be with either option.The good news is that this will allow for accessory manufacturers to create a range of different types of bands, including those that incorporate the lugs into the strap itself, like the connector version found on the Apple Watch Sport Band and the Leather Link Band, or do something more traditional with the strap, as with the Classic Leather band.It will probably take a while for the Made for Apple Watch program to spin up, so dont expect to see officially sanctioned third-party bands hitting the market all that quickly.

Pebble is looking to third-parties to help build up the smartstrap ecosystem, and thats a tall order when youve still only sold under 100,000 units (just over 90,000 as of this writing) during the campaign, despite all the Kickstarter records broken. Apple has a healthy third-party accessory ecosystem precisely because it sells so many millions of devices: Even 1 percent of the iPhone 6 userbase is a sizable market.Obviously,Pebble still has post-campaign retail sales to continue growing its Pebble Time user population, but the fractional market numbers it can offer accessory-makers is never going to approach something like the buyer population represented by iPhone, or even future Apple Watch owners. Which is why its good that the company is ponying up the $1 million fund, which is being distributed based on a system of merit determined by Pebble itself.Pebble says itll be combing crowdfunding platforms to find out about smartstrap projects, and will back those it deems worthy. The company is also soliciting pitches via Twitter and email for anyone who might be planning a smartstrap, and isnt pinning itself down with specifics on the terms of how it will actually allocate cash just yet. Its also promising promotion to worthwhile projects, to raise awareness among the Pebble community.As if to answer fears that the smartstrap concept will remain purely conceptual, Pebble points to some ideas that have already sprung from the community regarding prototypes. These arent even in the hardware development phase, Pebble stresses, but there are ideas that show promise being proposed by third-parties.They include a modular strap with individual links that contain separate features or sensors, like an NFC link, a heart rate sensor link a GPS link and so on. This is being planned by , and will work with a so-called Xadow adapter that provides the basic link between the modules and the Pebble Time itself.A second project called the Spark Electron, from Spark.io, which already has.

The offering would boast around 25 channels, including major broadcasters like ABC, CBS and Fox and would likely be priced around $30 or $40 a month, with an initial unveil in June (most likely at WWDC).This follows an announcement from Apple at last weeks event that it would be the exclusive first digital TV partner for HBO Now, which is the cable networks dedicated streaming service that is coming in April to Apple TV and iOS devices for $15 per month. The new service would offer more of a package similar to what , the over-the-top offering from Dish, provides in its $20 micro bundle for streamers.Apple is also talking to companies like Walt Disney and Fox, but the WSJ says it wont include content from NBCUniversal because of a spat between Apple and NBC parent Comcast Corp. So long as the company can muster a good crop of the kind of popular specialty channels that typically trigger expensive bundle sales in traditional cable and satellite packages, though, that omission probably wont be all that troubling to potential buyers  especially given that NBC is still available free OTA in most markets.If Apple does indeed launch this service as planned, its hard to understate the potential value it can drive across its lineup of hardware offerings. The service would work with iPhone and iPad, as well as with Apple TV, but the Apple TV is where it could move the needle most.Given this report, it seems very likely that Apples announcements at its Spring Forward event last week were intended to set up a scenario in which the Apple TV hardware becomes a gateway device for users new to its product line, as well as something that will greatly increase its appeal to existing owners and establishedApple fans alike.The price cut to $69 combined with the HBO Now access is already probably a powerful enough incentive to spike sales, but an online TV offering that greatly undercuts your typical bundle and offers more premium content at the same time has the potential to really explode Apple TV sales. Rumors about such an offering on Apples set-top box have existed since it was first introduced, and all the work Apple has done to make it a compelling independent offering arguably still pales in comparison to what it can accomplish by just throwing in some more traditional live channels.Apple TV is currently viewed as a supplement, not a replacement, to existing TV service for most users, and that might be its greatest limiting factor.

Apple has offered iPhone docks in the past with RCA and 3.5mm audio passthrough for stereo connectivity. This new patent could indeed offer audio output, as is mentioned in the title of the application, but it also includes options like wireless communication, proximity sensors, a touch-sensitive display and support for also connecting to and charging accessories, including (though it isnt mentioned specifically by name) the Apple Watch.The patent application, first filed in 2013, could help explain why Apple hasnt yet released a dock for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, if its working on something more full-featured with extended support for all Lightning devices. Of course, its equally possible that Apple was more content to leave that side of the business in the hands of third-party accessory makers, and this patent, like so many others, only represents an effort to get legal protection for an idea dreamed up by an engineer that wont become a real product.Still, there are certain conditions that make this an attractive possibility for Apple to pursue: One is the Apple Watch, and the other is HomeKit. As described in the patent, the new dock invention would allow for accessory charging in addition to the main iPhone docking, depending on the final configuration, and could offer induction-based charging methods for both accessories and future iPhones with that feature built-in. The dock would also be able to communicate with connected appliances and home accessories thanks to its built-in Wi-Fi.That could help it become a central hub for use with HomeKit, the framework Apple is using to make connected hardware and Internet of Things devices controllable via Siri and voice commands. It had been rumored that a refreshed Apple TV device could act as that central hub in the future, but a dock might make more sense and have a wider appeal for iPhone owners.Other variable features for the dock include possible LED display indicators to show charge level, audio mode and active data connections, for instance, as well as proximity sensors that can be used to trigger display features when a users hand comes close. Finally, the application also mentions support for various audio and video output capabilities.Apple probably doesnt need to make this gadget to get consumers interested in Apple Watch and HomeKit, but if both of those take off in a big way, it becomes a much easier sell for shoppers who are wholly invested in the Apple ecosystem. Like any patent or patent application, its definitely not a product roadmap, but it is an interesting possibility given the current slate of Apple hardware offerings.", "title": "Apple Explores A Smart Dock For iPhone That Could Also Act As A HomeKitHub"},

So far buying it has been about trial, you put it on and youre transported to another place.That experience is going to be vital to getting hundreds of millions of people to adopt it.He wouldnt go into more detail than that, but couldnt suppress a smile when interview moderator Josh Constine brought up the idea of trial stations at retailers like Best Buy.If the Crescent Bay demo at CES was any indication, the consumer Rift will feature graphics that would make a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One owner envious, so one would assume that the rig to power it (the Rift will not function as a standalone device in its first generation) will require more than just a high-end CPU  youll need a GPU that can handle high resolutions, large textures, high frame rates, and effects like shaders.Luckily, there will be some awesome games available day one for the Oculus Rift, Mitchell says. Thats because Oculus has quietly begun building its own games. While it previewed an experimental in-house title called Hero Bound , Mitchell revealed that Oculus has several small teams building first-party titles. It will also publish second-party titles built by outside developers, and allow third-party titles created entirely independently of Oculus on its platform.That doesnt mean there will be half-baked apps on the Rift. Games that are too shocking or nauseating could scare people away from virtual reality.Mitchell says that Oculus wants to make sure it only offers high-quality experiences at first, so expect it to have to review and approve Rift apps before theyre released. The company still values openness in its ecosystem, so it will allow third-party hardware peripherals and controllers to be compatible with the Rift. It will continue open sourcing its technologies when possible to aid developers.Itll be another month until Oculus reveals more at the E3 gaming conference. But if it can release a polished, somewhat affordable headset with great experiences from both inside and outside the company, Oculus could make the sci-fi dream of virtual reality finally come true.", "title": "Oculus Is Building Its Own Games For Rift, But Youll Need A Computer ToPlay"},

Well, primarily because the Urbane LTE are bucking Google and instead are running and is a fully-featured phone with NFC and a bigger battery.Its almost as if WebOS, like the old man in the wagon, is calling out I feel fine. I think Ill go for a walk!While Android Wear is a primarily a notification carrier, the LTE version runs WebOS so that it can support calling, messaging, and richer applications. This means the watch can connect to the web directly and pinpoint your location or translate text. It can also make calls, albeit via a Bluetooth headset or the watchs tinny speaker.Whats more interesting, however, is the decision to use WebOS at all. Android watches have existed almost as long as Android has been around and the decision to resurrect a non-standard mobile OS for a watch project sounds more science fair than market survey. The watch is Korea-only for the moment and I doubt it will roll Stateside any time soon. Alternatives to established mobile software is ostensibly welcome by the vociferous minority but I doubt seriously this thing will put a dent in even Android Wear uptake.It is nice of LG to dust WebOS off this week.

Google is calling this the first time anyone has built a single learning system that can learn directly from experience, according to Bloomberg, which has potential in a virtually limitless number of applications.Its still an early step, however, and Google expects itll be decades before it achieves its goal of building general-purpose machines that have their own intelligence and can respond to a range of situations. Still, its a system that doesnt require the kind of arduous training and hand-holding to learn what its supposed to do, which is a big leap even from things like IBMs Watson super computer.Next up for the arcade AI is mastering the Doom-era 3D virtual worlds, which should help the AI edge closer to mastering similar tasks in the real world, like driving a car.

And one thats fizzled out, rather than becominga standard issue feature  like, say, theLED flash on theback of your handset which doubles as a torch.Expense and battery life have likelyput paid to any mass mobile rollout of pico projectors so far. That and niche utility. Not everyone wants or needs a micro projector in their phone. But as more functions crowd onto the small screen, a tech that offersa way to feelless tethered to that screen when at home  and to widen its canvason demand  might well have broaderappeal.The team behind thisKickstarterproject, called , certainly think so. And theyve managed to pull in $400,000+ and counting  more than double their original target  from over 1,100 backers after just a few days on thecrowdfunding trail. Their campaign still has almost a month to run. Stretch goals ahoy.Their approach is to build an Android-powered pico-projector into a can that screws into an existing light socket. That means theres abuilt in fix for the battery life issue, given it pulls power from the mains.Obviously itlimits portability butportable pico projection always felt a bit like overkillgiven you need an uncluttered flat surface to project onto in any case. So focusing this tech on the home makes plenty of sense.Their Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connected pico-projector canbe controlled by an Android or iOS app, or by a Bluetooth device (theres also a manual switch on the light itself).The Beam also includes an LED light so its both projector and lightbulb (so wont entirely hijack yourlight socket).The projection resolution is a distinctly mid range(854 x 480 pixels, and 100 lumen on brightness). So backers should not beexpecting to help fund development of a high end HD home theatre projection experience. Set your expectations accordingly.Also on board:a couple of 2 Watt speakers, although userscan also link up their ownBluetooth speakers. Internal storage is 8GB unless stretch goals push that up, and the on-board processor is a mid to low range 1.3GHz dual-core. The maximum projection size you could expect from Beam is listed as 120 inches/~3 meters.The companion app the team are building will include some IF/THEN customizations so the user can configure their projector to displaya certain type of content at a certain time of day,such as showing weather and news in the morning; or changing whats shown depending on whos arrived home (presumably usingBluetooth to identify differentdevice users in its vicinity).Using Android as its on-board OS means the Beam also provides access to Googles Play Store  even if you have aniPhone as the controlling device. The team notes that content can be streamed to the projector from an iOS device via Airplay, or elsevia Miracast.Given its running Android, the team also points outdevelopers will be able to use existing IDE and tools to develop apps for thesmart projector.Price-wise, the pico-projector does not have a micro price-tag: its bumped up to$399 forKickstarter backers at this point, so its not exactly an impulse purchase. Or something to stick in light sockets in every room. But is quite a bit cheaper than full-fat home cinemaprojectors.The LA-based team behind Beam says itshoping to be able to ship the product to backers by October. ButKickstarter pledgers should always be prepared to be patient and/or disappointed before deciding to part with their cash.As with all crowdfundingprojects, and often especially those involving hardware, applies  given backersare pledging cash for a productprojection (appropriately enough in this case)not the real-dealfinished product.", "title": "Beam Is An App-Controlled Pico-Projector To Liven Up Your LightSockets"},

Luminox uses small tubes of tritium coated with phosphor. As the tritium decays it excites the phosphor, allowing the tubes to glow for years without charging in sunlight. Its a neat trick and it affords amazing readability in the dark. They put these tubes inside of the watch hands and array them around the face of the watch. In this case they even stick a small tube at the top of the bezel.Im a fan of Luminox and, although I prefer their automatic mechanical line over their quartz models, this watch grew on me. This new chrono is unique in that it is part of the ANU sea line and features secure screw-down pushers and a solid rubber bracelet. Like a few previous Luminox chronographs it features a big date  two large numerals that display the date instead of a single date window. The entire watch is Swiss made which we can take to mean that the movement, case, and bracelet are assembled in Switzerland.Luminox is not quite a luxury brand. They sell tool watches, bold, beefy pieces for folks who either expect to get into scrapes or maybe feel that they would like to. This model, for example, has a large rotating bezel that looks even a bit clumsy but is just right if youre expecting to bang this thing up against rocks. The black powder coating is thick and uniform and there is lume on the hands and the hour pips, allowing you to see the time but not the elapsed chronograph time, in the dark. The screw down crown is a bit fiddly  if you dont unscrew it completely you end up with a pusher that wont move  but it maintained water-fastness.This watch requires a very specific taste. If youre into pieces like the or the , youll understand the immediate allure of this chrono. As I noted before Im not a big fan of quartz chronographs but this one felt nice on my mid-sized wrist and was great to wear in the dark. Luminox has improved their design chops considerably over the years and this seems like a culmination of years of solid work.Expect to pay about $900 when this watch is available in stores and while it wont call your friends or send your heartbeat to loved ones, it will knock out a too-curious fish with a well-timed wrist smack.", "title": "Not Quite Smart, The Luminox ANU Chronograph Is At Least QuiteBright"},

Instead, with a piece of hardware its calling the , youre able to store your own information and content at home on an encrypted device, and then share that content directly over a secure connection with others  without having to first pass through other devices, servers, or websites.Over the years, several startups have attempted to combat dominant social networking services like those from Facebook,also by notingthe need for increased user privacy in their marketing pitches. But it hasnt been until recently weve seen even a slight shift in social networking beginning to take place  with growing numbersof consumers nowactiveon private, and often mobile, messaging and communications apps, for example.This is where could potentially fit in. While today it offers something of a home server for your content, users interact with its social networking services via either desktop apps for Mac or PC, or mobile applications on their tablets or smartphones. Initially its app will be released foriOS devices, with Androidsupport in the works.The idea for the Neobase device comes from Austin-based entrepreneur , a longtime internet advocate whos also President of the, the creator of open tools like the Miro video player, as well asa board member at thenonprofit news organization Mother Jones.Explains Glassco, as I guy who ran my own servers, I know that as soon as [your content is] on someone elses server, youre not really in control of it. Every privacy-based project youve seen so far before has been in the cloud, and I wanted to reverse the equation and have it completely free of the cloud, he says.With Neobase, the idea is to offer users a way to share their content without ceding that control to other companies, whose policies and rules can change at any time, while also keeping it safer from hackers who continually try to compromise these cloud-based services.The Neobase itself is a small, 1 TB encrypted hard drive that sits 6 inches high and is 3.5 inches wide. It connects to your home network by way of ethernet or Wi-Fi. An included USB port allows you to expand the drives storage, if need be, and the drive runs a customized version of Linux to support itssocial networking functions.However, unlike software solutionsthat ship with current mass-produced hard drives, such as Western Digitals , for example, Glassco says that the Neobase isnt about adding a Dropbox-like service to a personal hard drive  its really about offeringuserstheirown social networking platform.As it goes to launch, the device allows users to privately post and share files of any type, which others can then view if they have a Neobase account. One device can actually support up to five users  allowing you to add other, remote family members or friends to your private network, even if theyre not device owners. To share with more than five, however, someone else will need to add their own Neobase device to the mix. (The limitation has to do with ensuring good performance, the founder says.)Friends can like and comment on your shares via Neobase, and they canwatchyour videos through a built-in media player. But in the future, Glassco envisions that thehardware platform will support other applications, too, like video chat or document collaboration, for example.In terms of security, the Neobase apps use a secure SSH tunnel to connect to your device and the Neone Network, which is more secure than using a browser with SSL. But the technical underpinnings, which also involves an exchange of public and private keys, is a simple three-step process so users may not even realize how their content is being secured. Of course, nothing is 100% safe against a determined hacker,the device offers some risk reduction versus competing solutions.The Neobaseisselling for$299on Kickstarter, with a goal of raising $100,000. However, stresses Glassco, the crowdfunding is being put toward development. The startup is already backed by $5 million in outside funding from private investors, and it has already completed two manufacturing runs thatproduced over 50 devices.The Neobase is ready and will ship in July, he says. Now the question is whether theres a large enough audience actually willing to invest a few hundred bucks to secure their content and privacy.", "title": "The Neobase Is Your Own Private Social Network In ABox"},

(Lots of variation in the pressure sensors can indicate, for example, restless sitting or fidgeting, potential pressure point issues, etc).The app willalso keep track of how much you sit on other objects  or at least it will if you carry your phone with you in your pocket.On the motivational side, the Zami app will ping users who are slouching or who have been sitting for too long, encouraging you to get up and stretch your legs.

Iwata did say that well learn more about it next year, meaning it could make an initial appearance at E3 2016 or at its own dedicated unveiling.

The NX mention in this context seems like a reassurance regarding the companys continued plans to innovate in the dedicated gaming market, but if Iwata is hoping for a 2016 reveal, that would still be an accelerated refresh cycle vs. previous console generations.That brand new concept tidbit is interesting: It could just be straightforward marketing bluster, but Nintendo also probably knows it needs to wow with a Wii U follow-up.

Thats the common line of thinking when it comes to how Apple will change its retail operations to sell the watch.But I think thats shortsighted, and ignores several realities about Apple then andnow  and whether Apple is actually a luxury retailer.The Apple Watch is absolutely going to require a different school of thought when it comes to instructing users in person. Id actually argue that the iPhone really needed a different retail experience, too, but it never got one. It was plopped on the blonde wood tables alongside the Macs. As it got more popular it made the rotation to the front of the stores and took over iPod display areas and eventually the accessory walls.The iPad, on the other hand, was a natural fit  as an alternative laptop it was at home alongside Apples other computing products.A couple of years ago, that there had been a quantum leap in Apple retail sales from 2012 to 2013. His conclusion on the cause? The iPads natural store fit:The Apple Watch is not at all a natural fit for Apples current retail stores. And the iPhone could use some upgrades, as well.But Apple didnt hire Angela Ahrendts because its making a watch. No company as forward-thinking as Apple makes a hire as big as that based on a single product. When you look at Apples recent organizational changes, its clear that its actually finally rejiggering its machinery to produce and sell itsmuch more personal computers.The massive success of the iPhone wasnt something it was possible to prepare for. And the iPad was Apple finally getting around to the business of making the large-screen device it wanted to before it had to settle for pocketable. Both of those businesses have turned out incredibly well, and have given Apple the runway needed to figure out where to go next in order to avoid the innovators dilemma (again).The Ahrendts hire is interesting on a few levels. She was CEO but happy to go to Apple as just an SVP  albeit an incredibly well-compensated one (good for her).Shes done an incredible job with Burberry  cracking the hard nut of injecting desire into a brand assumed to be on the decline. In contrast, most folks dont see whatsneeded at Apple retail as obvious, but I think there are big changes coming in payments, store flow, show process and more. Since I started writing this story months ago, weve actually received some hard confirmation that a new shopping experience is coming to Apple retail, along with some rumors of what shape that experience might take.Apple is , with new kinds of questions to ask people buying a watch. And there are rumors will be much more like one youd have in a jewelry store rather than an electronics store.Once you take Ahrendts into account you also see of the Apple are to not just into a watch but on personal, even wearable, computing. It needs people who understand things that humans wear and choose to fit their personality. And it needs people who know how to sell those things. This is a far different tack than the one Apple has been on for the past decade. The one where it explicitly tells people how the things they own should look and how they should make them feel. Aluminum, slim, plastic, shiny, whatever. I think it signals big moves. Yes, its a great hire, period. but also momentous in terms of how Apple sells.And we might , woo!One constant conversation around Apple is whether it is or is not a luxury brand. In some minds, the gold Apple Watch Edition has sealed the deal. Its obviously being sold on the merits of its chemical composition, not its functionality.But what if Apple produced a hardened gold iPhone? Is an item still a luxury if its your primary computer? What if its your only car? Your only watch? Id argue that the high-end Apple Watch isnt about being luxe, its about personal statement and sentiment.A billionaire still cant buy a better phone than you or I (if youre a billionaire reading this, hi), but they can certainly buy one that makes them differently. If someone with the means wants to buy an iPhone and have it coated in precious liquid metal, why not? And if Apple wants to facilitate that, then all the better.The argument that Apple is doing something awful by offering a more expensive item that works the same way as a lesser expensive item is stupid.The fact that the version of the Apple Watch that could cost thousands works the same as the one that costs a few hundred is actually friendly to everyman market, not The common logic is that if someone is buying something made of gold rather than a functional aluminum, theyre being wasteful or silly. But if youre the kind of person whobelieves youre being smarter by buying the least expensive, most utilitarian version and you look down on someone wearing a precious metal, then youre engaging in the exact same kind of snobbery just in reverse.To put it simply, its not about luxury, its not about how it works  its about how it makes you feel.Apple is in the process of creating and selling a new class of product that is based on And it needed a retail chief who understands that its going to be different to sell that than something that sits on your desk.In reality, Apple started selling wearable devices in 2007. When something is only one thin layer of cloth away from your skin, the majority of your waking hours, thats a wearable piece of technology, regardless of whether it has a clasp or not. And thats not even mentioning But it never changed the way that it was presenting those items to people in stores or messaging what they will do for you in a sales environment. That needs to happen now.And if those changes are made successfully, I think we can expect another quantum leap for Apple retail.", "title": "Selling A WearableApple"},

And this is the first time Ive been actually excited about a technology in five.He had just walked me through one of the best demos I had ever seen. It was the , a sensor-studded helmet with dual hand controllers that allowed me to enter almost a dozen alternate universes as real and as exciting as the real world. When I say I was impressed, amused, and excited, trust me. This was one of the best things Ive seen in a long time and I am thrilled that I got to be part of it.The Vive, which is in its development stage, is essentially an immersive VR goggle set that ascertains your position using pulsing laser lights. Sensors on the mask triangulate your height and X/Y/Z coordinates based on the position of the lasers and the hand controllers look like a more stylized Wiimote but turn into futuristic ray gun like appendages (or even cartoon hands) in the game. The entire rig ran off of a stock but powerful gaming PC that pumped out the various demos including an undersea adventure complete with whale, a cooking test that looked like a Nintendo game, and a sneak preview of a new Portal game that was so immersive that you get chills when a massive GlaDOS unfurls like a malevolent umbrella.The content made the demo and Valves games were, in a word, amazing. They were funny, fun, and perfectly calibrated to excite the senses and incite wonder. It was interactive umami  the hardware, the software, the graphics, and the writing were all mixed together to create something that I have never seen.I have used multiple VR systems, most recently the Oculus, but this was something different entirely. It was smooth, sharp, and the content was perfectly suited for the medium. Everything interacted without a stutter or stitch. A painting demo allowed you to create 3D objects in real space and made me realize that this was the perfect environment for 3D modeling. The tiny tabletop game demo  essentially a sort of tower defense game in miniature  made me forget I was in a featureless room in Barcelona. The closest thing I can compare it to was the vision in William Gibsons where jacked in players controlled tiny 3D fighter planes. It was the first time in years that I smiled at a demo.I have waited a long time for William Gibsons vision of cyberspace to become real. It became real today for me in that room. I do not want to oversell this but of all the systems Ive seen  and there are still plenty out there  this was the closest to magic. And we all know what My only complaint? The frame rate on some of the characters wasnt quite great resulting in blurry characters. But I didnt care. It was beautiful.HTC isnt quite done. The setup is clunky and only the dev kit is shipping this spring. But I think HTC and Valve have created something amazing here and I think these two companies are doing exactly the right thing at exactly the right time. Weve paid lip service to VR for two decades but its finally been cracked. As these tools get better expect realtors to start selling VR rooms in their new homes and expect conference tables to hit the skids as we all wander around interacting in virtual space. Do not misunderstand me: this is cutting edge technology in the way, say the way Macintosh changed computing and the Motorola StarTAC changed telephony. It is both vitally important and yet amazingly nascent and I am looking forward to see where things are headed next. Until then, I cant wait to play with this at home.", "title": "HTC And Valve Have Cracked The VRCode"},

At least for Apple Watch and the new MacBook, Ahrendts is directing store staff to push customers to order online, rather than try their luck at physical locations.In the memo, under the heading Get in line online, Ahrendts advises retail staff to tell customers that the Apple Store app and web-based storefront are the best way to ensure guaranteed delivery of Apple Watch and new MacBook, and the push to drive them to those outlets is called a significant change in mindset by the retail executive.The days of waiting in line and crossing fingers for a product are over for our customers. The Apple Store app and our online store make it much easier to purchase Apple Watch and the new MacBook. Customers will know exactly when and where their product arrives.This is a significant change in mindset, and we need your help to make it happen. Tell your customers we have more availability online, and show them how easy it is to order.

The new MacBook also has an ambitious and many brand new components that could very easily limit initial availability, which might be another reason to encourage shoppers to head online.But in either case, unless Apple is anticipating an imbalance much more drastic than the usual conflict of demand vs. availability at product launch (iPhone demand always far outstrips hardware availability, for instance, leading to long lines at Apple Stores months into new model debuts), this represents a big change in overall philosophy.Apples splashy launches have almost always featured long retail lines, especially at flagship stores in NYC, London, San Francisco and other world capitals. Apple employees have not, to my knowledge, previously been encouraged to try to temper these crowds by directing eager shoppers to either the retail app or the online store. Theres good reason for that: crowds attract headlines, which help with Apples overall narrative of being highly in demand.Its possible that this launch is being treated in a unique manner because its a unique type of product for Apple, one whose goals the Apple-faithful ritual of waiting in line overnight, or for days on end, doesnt serve. But its also possible that Apples new head of retail thinks the company will be better served by optimizing for successful product delivery, and fewer frustrated customer expectations, than by the spectacle of huge queues.The retail experience shift that will accompany the introduction of the Apple Watch is probably our first chance to witness Ahrendts influence in action, so this coming launch will doubtless be one to watch for those interested in the future direction of Apples brick-and-mortar stores.", "title": "Leaked Memo Says Apple Will Push Retail Store ShoppersOnline"},

He was directly responsible for the company producing their first in-ear headphones and the companys latest cans, The e Series. makes things makers use to make other things. And its all because of Limor Fried. She founded the company in 2005 with the goal to create the best place online for learning electronics and making the best designed products for makers of all ages and skill levels. Since its founding, the company expanded into tools and merchandise, all while keeping its focus on electrical components. Now ten years into this venture, Fried has had a front row seat in watching the makers movement grow into a major force.The Hardware Is Eating The World panel takes place on at noon on Monday, May 4th at Disrupt NY.

The team effort will involve capabilities, intellectual property and expertise from both companies, and will involve Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Ethicon, maker of medial devices.All of the language in the announcement of the partnership suggests that the companies will be using robotics to supplement, not replace human surgeons, at least in this stage of the partnership. The passage below perhaps best illustrates the intent of the collaboration:Robotic-assisted surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery that uses technology to give surgeons greater control, access and accuracy during the surgical procedure while benefitting patients by minimizing trauma and scarring, enabling accelerated post-surgical healing. The companies seek to develop new robotic tools and capabilities for surgeons and operating room professionals that integrate best-in-class medical device technology with leading-edge robotic systems, imaging and data analytics.Robot-assisted surgery generally involves a human surgeon controlling instruments via a computer or a remote manipulator. It allows for more finite control and precision than is normally possible with a human operating with their kludgy meat hands, no matter their skill or dexterous ability. The result can be far less invasive procedures, meaning faster recovery time.The platform described for this specific collaboration would also likely be used to collect and analyze data related to procedures, with the aim of improving treatment and specific surgery practices over time. Google Glass has been used in some robot-assisted surgery setups, as well, and the tech giants involvement and resources could hopefully help defray some of the costs associated with robot-assisted procedures over time.", "title": "Google To Build Robotic Surgery Assistance Platform With Johnson &Johnson"},

A few hours, right? revealed a solution onstage today at TechCrunch Disrupt NY that can charge a phone in minutes. With this technology, the company aims to allow a Tesla can be fully recharged in the amount of time it takes to pump a tank of gas.The company says its suite of battery technologies, called Intelligent Energy System, can change the way energy is stored and transferred while also extending the life of the battery, and is ready to be applied to batteries in the next generation of devices.The promise is radical yet the companys founders have a long history in this field. Ian Hunter founded Nucleus Scientific in 2007 and is the Hatsopoulos Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT and head of the Bioinstrumentation Laboratory.The rest of the team is a mix of PhDs in chemistry, physics and engineering, and many are from MIT. Disrupt NY is the firms first public demonstration after operating under the radar for the last eight years; itrevealed an engineering prototype power bank to demonstrate itsadvancements.The company wants to license the patented technology and isalready in talks with several established companies about incorporating their hardware and software solution into existing and future product lines.This power bank is similar to others on the market but features radically different capabilities. Its incredible, really. The 10,000 mAh engineering prototype can fully charge in 15 minutes instead of the hours usually required. That means the power bank is pulling and storing enough energy from a standard wall outlet at a rate that would recharge a smartphone in three minutes.The company also produced a working system for an electric scooter battery. Traditionally, to charge a battery required for a 12km ride would take 280 minutes; its only 10 minutes with Nucleus Scientifics solution.Nucleus Scientifics Intelligent Energy System marries hardware breakthroughs with custom software to achieve their results. The complete system of custom batteries, sensors, feedback control systems and algorithms not only allows for unheard of charge times, but also extends the life of the battery.The company constructed a large battery testing facility to build-out this technology. In the lab, the company recharged 14,000 mAh batteries (equal to ninesmartphones) in 100 seconds. But if the charge time is increased to three minutes, the company was able to double the life of the battery.Today, the most commonly used method to charge batteries is called Constant-Current Constant-Voltage (CCCV). Its recharging scheme is hard on batteries, ultimately limiting its life. Instead of applying a constant current to the batteries like in CCCV, real-time monitoring of the battery is used to regulate the voltage charging the battery, extending the life of the battery. The efficiency of the system even allows for the design of radically smaller power chargers, reducing the size of a standard 100W power converter by a factor of six times.Nucleus Scientific says the technology is ready to be applied to various configurations of lithium-ion and lithium polymer batteries. The concept isnt limited to small batteries, either  the firm says they plan to scale the technology from smartphone batteries to electric vehicles.Batteries are often the limiting factor of portable devices and Nucleus Scientific seemingly has a solution that will unlock the full potential of everything from smartphones to lanterns to medical equipment.", "title": "Nucleus Scientific Launches To RevolutionizeBatteries"},

It has a tight 1 meter reach and it includes force-sensing at the joints that let it sense the position of parts in semi-structured environments, which means it can find a part even if the positioning is slightly off.

Whereas you might interact with your phone several minutes at a time and your computer for hours at a time, you are going to use your Watch for seconds at a time and the software really needs to be tuned to take that into account.Salesforce wanted to be a part of the wearables revolution and even launched a Wearables SDK last June. Today they released three products designed specifically to work on the Watch.First of all, there is the previously mentioned Salesforce Wave for Apple Watch. This provides an at-a-glance view of important information you want to be notified about. He acknowledges that this is not about detailed analysis, but getting key data when it matters. If you want more, you are going to go to your phone or tablet on the road (or your computerin the office).The second piece is Salesforce1 for Apple Watch which provides quick access to the entire range of Salesforce information including sales, service, marketing and employee community. For instance, a sales manager might get an alert when a discount is required on deal and a marketer might get an alert when a campaign reaches itspipeline goal.The final piece is Salesforce Wear for Apple Watch, which is an SDK to help Salesforce customers build applications on the Salesforce platform to work on the Apple Watch.Peachey also sees a big role for the Watch in marketing directly to consumers. He believes when used correctly, businessescould use the Watch as an avenue to communicate directly with customers.Marketers will have to tread carefully in this regard though because they dont want to overwhelm Watch users with promotions or the device could very quickly become unbearable.But thats true of all notifications, regardless of thetype. Its not about delivering more and more notifications, he said. You can be nudged when something important in business happens, and very quickly see what happened.Peachey says while Salesforce made a conscious decision to get in early, he sees the wearables market in general and the Apple Watch in particular as an area thats going to explodeover the next several yearsThat also means, IT needs to start thinking about a new screen size and a new paradigm on top of mobile, social and cloud. Salesforce hopes to help its customers get going quickly.Industry and people will realize, the personal and instant way you get updated on something important.

Privacy was a theme bubbling under the surface at the Mobile World Congress tradeshow  even more so than last yearwhenSilent Circle and Geeksphone with demos of a privacy-centric smartphone called Blackphone.This year theywereback with a sequel device, ,and a plan to release a tablet, under the moniker Blackphone+. Now , the Blackphone team was alsotouting a suite of enterprise-focused encrypted apps and services,flush with $50M in new financing.Geeksphone co-founder Javier Agera, who has now moved over tohead up innovation for Blackphone, said SGP Technologies priority now is scaling up  by targeting the enterprise market.I wouldnt define Blackphone as a social enterprise but theres definitely a component there as towards making the world more secure and protecting peoples privacy. So its a big opportunity and were now focusing on making Blackphone grow, he told TechCrunch.Now in the second year were stepping up.Were entering into the converged space with the tablet. We are re-exploring how enterprises use this kind of device.We dont expect every single enterprise to take a Blackphone+ into a meeting room, so into vertical use, thats why we make it available in different forms and flavors so we can adapt and cater to the different needs.While the original Blackphone was marketed atprosumers, and they remaina secondary target, Agera said the big growth opportunity for Blackphones pro-privacy hardware and software is in the enterprise space, driven by the consumerization of enterprise IT and the BYOD (bringyour own device) trend.The perimeter of security is no longer inside the building its outside. So thats why were focused on enterprise, he said.Blackberry, the erstwhile encrypted email enterprise darling, did not even have a boothat this years MWC  although it did it has in the pipes for release later this year, showingthat while its fortunesare undoubtedly downits not entirely out of the mobile game. And with security rising up the enterprise agenda Blackberry may feel it has reasons to be cheerful.Still, its clearthe years of Blackberry owningenterprise mobility are over. Which means more room for newcomers, like Blackphone, to elbowin with freshsolutions.This is privacy. Securitys part of that. Privacy is security and policy, saidAgera, talking generally about the scope of the Blackphone project. Its not only how secure is your device, but also what do you do with your device? And we help users and companies figure out how to protect their personal data in a real-world scenario. So we know people will install Angry Birds in the phone, we just help companies create the policies so that Angry Birds is totally isolated from their [work content].Another relative newcomer to the smartphone space, Finnish mobile startup Jolla, also had some security news on the slate at MWC, announcing a partnership with SSH Communications  to create a . Thats likely not arrivingtil next year but the trajectoryis tellingly similar, with Jolla also pointing to businesses and governments as potential customers of hardware running Sailfish Secure.All of the devices at a certain point will have a security client, Jolla co-founder Marc Dillon told TechCrunch in an interview, explaining howSailfishs security credentials are going to be burnished.So they can have secure communications peer to peer, device to device. Then in conjunction with SSH we can also offer solutions to enterprises so that if banks, hospitals, things that require high levels of security and want to be able to freely communicate peer to peer they can.Jolla hasalso now got a , and since launching its first device at the end of2013 has made a point of emphasizing howits business model does not involve selling user data to third parties making privacy protection a highlightedpoint of differentiation between Sailfishand GooglesAndroid. So its also now pushingprivacy plus security.Weve had a lot of interest from governments, Dillon added.Weve been talking to the European Union. Weve been talking to the Russian government Theyve come to us.Theyve been talking about this in the news.Jollas European originsexplains the regional interest from Russia. This is post- geopolitics being played out via non-U.S. mobile platform preferences, giving regional players some potential business uplift.Blackphone, meanwhile, has ties to the U.S., with offices and investors there, but has chosen to beheadquartered in Europe, in Switzerland, a country whichenshrines a right to private communications and email in its constitution. And its forked Googles Android  creating asecurity-hardened version of theplatform, called PrivatOS, thats loaded onto its own brand hardware (assembled and security signed in Madrid, Spain), with Google services replaced with its own suite of secure apps.Its business is also software as a service as well as hardware  extending Silent Circles original portfoliowith a suiteofencrypted communications apps and services thatrun on other devices, including iOS and Android. The company ispositioning its businesstoreach broadly across the mobile space to serve enterprise customers of all stripes.Agera says Blackphone already has government agencies using its services  including in the U.S.We sell worldwide, in all regions of the world. Latin America, Middle East, South East Asia, South Korea, everywhere, he added. We have companies from Fortune 50, Fortune 1000. Some corporations use us across the company, some for just the top executives. Even some corporations, they dont use us but they have us as a back-up solution  because for example when Sony was broken into, how do you manage that crisis?In , like they had in the warehouse, five-year-old Blackberrys Wed rather our customers use us as a daily phone, but thats part of it. Each corporation has different needs, and we have to cater to those needs.Elsewhere on the MWC show floor a Brazilian startup called Sikur was showing off a Blackphone-a-like privacy-focused handsetcalled  touting encrypted text messaging, voice, group chat and email, along withAndroid and iOS versions of its software  so buyers of its devicesarent locked into talking to a limited circle of just GranitePhone users.The Brazilian government has been ,soits nosurprise that a homegrownstartup hasfollowed Blackphones lead and is pitching counter-surveillance technologies of itsown.Open source company Mozilla, which makes the HTML5-based Firefox mobile OS, was also talking privacyin Barcelona this week  promotingan ongoing collaboration with German carrier Deutsche Telekom, which it.Media reports initially, thinking the pair were about to unbox adedicated privacy phone. That was not in fact the case. Instead they discussed anongoing collaboration thats aiming tobake privacy thinkinginto Mozillas Firefox OS  in order to bring data privacy closer to customers, as they put it when they announced the initiative last year.While not as instantly tangible a concept as a privacy phone, itsfurther evidence of privacy concerns filtering downinto business practices  and being used as a point of differentiation to attract customers, asDenelle Dixon-Thayer, Mozillas SVP of business and legal affairs, couched itduring an on stage panel.The session also included Dr Claus Ulmer, group privacy officer for Deutsche Telekom.Thepairsaid the business imperative to come up withprivacy solutions boilsdown to building user trust  and that brand trust has been converting into improved revenues for Deutsche Telekom, said Ulmer.We always try to put the user first, addedDixon-Thayer. Users are fearful about whats happening to their data. Who has access to their data. Whats happening if the entity gets access to the data We need to have those users trust the ecosystem. If we get them to trust the ecosystem were going to generate more interest, more support from them, and were going to get more out of it If users understand the value exchange.. theyre more likely to feel comfortable sharing their data.One area she said Mozilla has been working on ismaking its privacy policies more accessible and intelligible for mobile users  by, for instance, writing them using aninth grade reading modeland usingbullet points to condenseand foreground key points, to offer a digested and accessible summary ahead ofthe full T&Cs. They also actively size policies to fit onsmall mobile screens.Dixon-Thayer said a lot more needs to be done generally in the digital space to get technology users reading and understanding the implications of what theyare agreeing to. She calledfor more creative approaches to engageusers by making privacy policiessimple and interesting enough  perhaps using contextual alerts, or pictures to helpconveythe implications ofdata sharing in a more immediately graspableway.The next step requires more user engagement, she argued. In Firefox OS weve really tried to do something differently. We have created space for privacy policies for all of these different parties in the transactions, and some folks have wanted to include theirs in our OS.Part of it is that I think the challenge is we need to do it more contextually  so its in context for the user, so the user doesnt just agree to something at the outset and then not really understand what that means later. Because thats part of the problem of not engaging them in that value exchange We need to be creative about how we do it. I think alerts by the phone is one way we can do it.Deutsche Telekoms Ulmer saidthe aimof the privacy collaboration with Mozilla is to help users understand whats going on with their device, and also give them more control, so they can influence how or what kind of data is flowing  perhaps via offering varying degrees of data obfuscation.He gave the example of a location blur feature which lets users choose how specifically (or otherwise) they want their location to be transmitted.For what reason does a weather app need to know exactly where you are at this moment? he asked. This solution will offer you the ability to blue your location to a radius of 10km or to a country or have a random solution for that.These are quite intelligent solutions that really help all of us to have a better future in the mobile world. And they also help the companies to sell their products because as long as wehave the trust of the customer well also succeed in the business.The twoboth made the point that more collaboration is needed among players in the digital industry generally to pro-actively work on baking privacy by design into their business processes to avoid therisk of having regulators step in and do it for them.All the participants in it need to be comfortable about being transparent, and today not everybody is  because theyre concerned that if theyre transparent what if their competitors not and then they look like theyre doing something bad when in fact its the industry really doing it, Dixon-Thayer noted.So we need to be better as a group and collectively say this is where we want to go, how can we get ourselves there?Its only going to get worse for all of us to operate in this space if we dont actually take on some self-regulation and do it ourselves, she added.Intels Brian Hernacki, chief architect of its New Devices Group, which includeswearables, was also speaking during the session  and he looked past mobile to considerprivacy in an age of myriad connected devices, which he argued amps up the risks in multiple ways andtherefore requires a new approach.Youve got people who make coffee pots and belt buckles and shoes. They dont live and breathe technology, they dont live and breathe privacy law. They dont necessarily even have a legal department to help them digest the privacy law thats out there. The space itself is also much more prone to sensing, collecting data, he argued, adding:It almost inherently creates more risk.We want the value that comes out of these great devices that collect our information and make recommendations to us And the devices themselves are more challenging; they need to share. They have very tiny little processor, very tiny little memory, very tiny littlebattery,they need to ask that smartphone or that cloud service to help them accomplish the task that you want them to do.At the most basic level, wearables tiny screens clearly arent suited to displaying or otherwise delivering lengthy privacy policies. Some connected devices dont or wont even have screens. So how will IoT devicemakers even be able to meaningfully gain user consent for data processing?There were no clear answers during the session on how to fix that specific issue, butHernacki argued there is a business opportunity at this nascent point in the development of IoT to advocate for privacy by design, and for othersto come along and sell pre-designed, pre-integrated pro-privacy technologies and platforms to the smaller entities who arebuilding connecteddevices.In other words IoT startups could be soldprivacy services and expertise  such astechnologies that automatically encrypt or safely transmit data, to relieveevery OEM in the space from having togo build a TLS stack themselves, whichHernacki asserted is never going to happen.We need to understand that IoT means thousands, or 10,000 OEMs, who are not necessarily deep technical players, who may not have deep legal partners, there has to be an aggregation capability.Someone has to provide pre-designed technologies, so that when somebody goes to build that bracelet or that smart shoe, or that wireless charging IKEA table, then every one of these companies doesnt have to think through and then resolve these problems.There are a lot of OEMs out there without deep resources to really invest individually in this. And the more best practices and core capabilities that we can bring in, pre-integrated platforms to those manufacturers, the better chance we have of covering the market with the kind of privacy-centric design that we want. Were not going to be able to rely on 10,000 OEMs to all do it right, he continued.A lot of the traditional techniques, education, transparency, accountability, choice, are absolutely great beginnings, but theyre not enough. Were going to need more than that.Dont get me wrong, this is still a very hard problem. There are still very challenging technical barriers. But were at the right moment in time to do it. Were well educated to do it. And I think, when I talk to people in the industry, were all motivated to do this well, he added.Theres a great opportunity. A lot of the companies here are looking at building these pre-packaged technologies to enable this explosive growth. To enable the kind of capabilities that we want to see out of wearables and IoT.", "title": "The Business Of Privacy On Show AtMWC"},

And will enable new use-cases which you couldnt do with your phones, he added.Pichaialso touched on the other strand of VR:the whollyimmersive flavor thats associated with headsets designed to take people away fromtheir real world environment.Only yesterday, here at MWC, HTC became the latest company to announce an immersive  in partnership with games company Valve.As with a device like theOculus Rift, the Vivesaim is to allowthe wearer to feel transported out of their real world environs  to somewhere else completely.Having played around with something even as simple as [Google]Cardboard, which shows how for less than $10 you can create that kind of immersive experience shows whats possible, notedPichai.While much of the current VR focus is on gaming, this is just the first wave of VR inPichais view  which makes sense given that Googles own AR specs (Glass) were not designed for gaming but rather to be embedded into everyday life. Thats evidently where Google, which after all makes its money from targeting advertising, sees the real value in VR and AR: as a layer that evenmore tightly connectsback-end computing and big data-mining to real-world human activity.Early on in these technologies the computing power you need tends to be the sort of use-cases which work well with gaming. Because gaming needs a lot of computing power, these devices need a lot of computing to make it work and so theres good synergy, said Pichai. I think gaming will drive the early adoption of this. Just like we saw with PCs or with smartphones Both for us and iOS, games have been a big part of it. But it starts there, then evolves into much broader use-cases. And well see the same in VRAnsweringa question about what he sees coming in the next year in the mobile space,Pichai suggestedwearables will be taking concrete steps and becomingmore often a part of yourlives.Im excited about newer categories like VR, he added.Pichaisuggested embedded cloud processing will be the driver for more people to adopt wearables  byallowing server-side clout to usefullyaugment peoples lives, and do so in a way that increasingly fades into the background (thanks to whatever sleight of hand the likes of Magic Leap has up its sleeve).For me the power of what you see is not just in devices, the focus of a place like this these are computing devices, connected to the cloud When I look at things like machine learning, AI, the kind of computing work we are doing to make these experiences much more powerful  thats what will delight usersin the next few years. I think we are working very hard to make these computing experiences much more seamless, and much more intelligent for users, saidPichai.Most of computing has been automating what people do in their day to day lives. But I think we are at this exciting stage where we can do more. We can be very intelligent and genuinely help people.", "title": "Googles Pichai Talks Up Magic Leaps AR But Says Itll Take Some"},

Apple posted details about its program on its website this week, revealing technical specifications related to how to build lugs that meet its standards, as well as providing info about how it will supply lugs itself for accessory makers to use.Apple never gave any indication it wouldnt open up Apple Watch straps to third-party gadget makers, but this confirms the basics of how the program will work. As with Apples other Made for programs, however, including Made for iPhone (MFI), it will be making sure that after-market add-ons not of its own making match certain standards. MFI certification can be tricky to get, especially now that Apple supplies all Lightning connector components complete with embedded chips for use in MFI devices.In this case, Apple is offering lug components to manufactures optionally, along with the option to build the parts themselves, using an extremely limited specific-use, non-transferable license. Its likely Apples standards will be high when it comes to lugs created by third-parties versus those its supplying itself, but its unclear what the relative cost advantages or hindrances might be with either option.The good news is that this will allow for accessory manufacturers to create a range of different types of bands, including those that incorporate the lugs into the strap itself, like the connector version found on the Apple Watch Sport Band and the Leather Link Band, or do something more traditional with the strap, as with the Classic Leather band.It will probably take a while for the Made for Apple Watch program to spin up, so dont expect to see officially sanctioned third-party bands hitting the market all that quickly. Many types of MFI-certified Lighting accessories rolled out slowly, but in that case there was likely more component complexity.", "title": "Apple Details Its Made For Apple Watch Third-Party BandProgram"},

Namely that its gearing up to compete in the gaming wearable space, announcing a partnership with games publishertobring avirtual reality headset tomarket, called the HTC Vive  to compete with the likes of the Oculus Rift.HTC said a consumer version of the Vive will be coming before the end of this year, with a dev edition landing this spring.In recent years we have seen the first forays into creating [virtual reality]experience. But no one has definedthe ideal experience. Today we are ready to take you into that world  fully immersed. We will bring you a virtual reality experience no one has seen before, with a ground breaking partner  Valve, said HTC CEO Peter Chou announcing the Vive on stage.We believe virtual reality will totally transform the way we interact with the world. It will become a mainstream experience for general consumers. The possibilities are limitless.The Vive will offer aroom-scale VR experience, delivered via over 70 sensorsto provide full 360 room-scale tracking. The refresh rate will be 90 Hertz  for what HTC said will be a new benchmark for performance and comfort. A.k.a. it wont make you feel nauseous.Wearers of the headset will be able to exploreobjects from all angles looking up and down, according to HTC  and wont just be able to look around but move around and interact much as you do in the real world, using it in conjunction with a series of wireless controllers. The headset itself is described as lightweight to aid comfort.Chou suggested the Vivewill enable multiple types of VR experiences  such asviewing scenery, attending real-time concerts, watching films, 3D chat and even shopping.Valve is a high-profile partnership win for HTC, given the brandscachet in the gaming space. The formerhad already been sniffing around VR, showing off a . Its also been working on making atouchpad controller for its Steam platform  albeit thats been long-delayed.Valvesoriginal announcement for the Steam controller wasin butin May last year itsaid the.

Its launched a website, , where it said it will be sharingmore details about the Vive.Does the world need another face computer? HTC and Valve reckon so, albeit one thats specifically targeted at gamersinstead of  as in the spectacularly unfocused (puns intended) case of Google Glass  attempting to persuade generalconsumers that apair of weird looking glasses with a camera on will bring benefits to their lives.Where Glass hybrid hardware just makesnormal people uneasy, the HTC-Valve love-in is taking inspiration fromthe (now Facebook-owned) playbook of virtual reality headset reboots. Microsoft also recently outedanaugmented reality headset its developing, calledalso intended for indoor and (mostly) gaming/entertainment-based usage.Bottom line: alienating your immediate family with a weird looking face computer is borderline acceptable, especially if youre doing it in your bedroom where your nearest and dearest are used to seeing you noodle around with gadgets.Sony also recently tipped its hand on a pair of smart spec its building.

(Sadly, TechCrunchs Lumia 929 remains unsupported, so if you spot a tech blogger crying in the corner, I just need a minute.)Microsofts released a chart detailinghow many users made it to build 10051 on a per-minute basis, with data covering about an hour.

Theres a grab-bag of apps for that. Need to build an app? There are code libraries and APIs to plug into. Building some hardware? Additive printing can extrude the pieces for you to put together. Slot in aRaspberry Pi and your gizmo getsa brain. Bish, bash, bosh!Picking up this modular baton and running with it is : a modular construction system consisting of discrete, standardized parts for making reusable metal skeletons to house your hardware project. Think of it as akin toLego but more durable, given these blocks are precision manufactured metal bars with metalconnectors called nodes that allow thepiecesto be screwedtogether.Dynamic modules are also included in the kit, so your metal constructions can includemoving parts and components. There are also some modules with full functions, such as a laser module capable of engraving and cutting. And a sub-system for integratingelectromechanicalcomponents, such as motors and actuators, into builds. Microprocessor components can also be integrated via a dedicated Brain-Box component  that containseither an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi.Founder Alex Pirseyedi, who has a background in mechanical and software engineering, saysUberBloxaims to slot in the gap between cheap plastic building blocks and more skilled building processes for fabrication that are used to create more rigid and elaborate structures.As great as building blocks are, they dont address the need to build more robust structures. Anyone interested in making things like machines that actually do things, accurately, is generally stuck with either having someone else build it for them, or take the years to develop skills needed to get good at design and fabrication, then spend long hours on building their designs, he tells TechCrunch.Pirseyedi says the most similar traditional metal building systems to UberBloxare products likeT-slot aluminum extrusions. But the difference with UberBlox isthe pieces aredesigned to be used without needing to modify them bydrilling or cutting and so on, so they can be reused again and again.He also argues that taking a more modular approach to construction can make it easier to design whatever it is youre trying to make in the first place  because the standardized pieces can help suggest the structure.Having used systems such as T-slot extrusions for years for designing machines, I often had to deal with a great deal of design choices. That may sound like a good thing at first glance. But it could also introduce analysis-paralysis, he says.The fact that you are not forced into using simple discrete parts that are given to you as exact individual tools you get used to use over and over again, makes you have to think and over-think your design, or even wonder where to begin. I also found that the large number of connection options of these other systems cause you to have to make slow design decisions and sometimes be stuck with settling on certain design details.Who is UberBlox for? The maker community is a clear target butPirseyedi also sees potentialin various other areas such as light manufacturing, architectural and structural design.Another focus is education. STEM and edTech are a great focus for us. Several university engineering departments have already shown interest in working with us to bring this system into their offering as a powerful tool to teach engineering skills, in mechanical and structural design as well as programming of automated machines, he adds. We believe strongly in this system can help people who are trying to learn and/or improve their machine building and programming skills.At this pointUberBlox remains an aspiration.Pirseyedi is currently raising funds on to get his metal kits to market later this year. Hes after $100,000 to do that and is only around a third of the way there with just over 20 days left of his campaign to run so a successful crowdfunding is still some way off.The cost of the construction kits might give some makers pause. A pick your own selection of parts kit option requires a $399 Kickstarter pledge, although less fulsome kits cost less.Pirseyedi says UberBlox are priced competitively with T-slot systems but againemphasizes the re-use point asan advantage over thosealternatives.You are getting an intricate high quality metal part that you can keep re-using for decades as part of a modular system that gives you efficiency, flexibility, re-usability, and ease of use, he says. The point is, you spend less in the long run both in tangible dollars and in the time it takes to put something together. Thats the value this system brings to you.", "title": "UberBlox Is Metal Building Block Kits ForMakers"},

The sessions allow customers to learn about their new device and be walked through its features, as well as have the opportunity to ask questions.Specialists will also be making app recommendations, the email says, and will help customers personalize their device.Whats interesting is that initially the virtual personal setup appointments were to only be offered to those buying either of the two higher-end smartwatches: the Apple Watch and the Apple Watch Edition. These customers were to be offered virtual try-on experiences ahead of purchase, which would then be followed by the setup sessions.However, today, Apple Sport Watch buyers are also receiving invitations to schedule their personal setup appointments online.Sessions are available in the morning, afternoon, and evening hours, and currently have availability through May 7th, though many of the early time slots are already filled. The online form also allows customers to indicate what specifically theyre looking to receive help with when their appointment time rolls around.The online appointment is basically a virtualized extension of the personal setup sessions already offered in Apples retail stores, butare indicative of the companysongoing shift with regard to its Apple Watch launch, and ultimately, its sales strategy as a whole.Apple now moves customers to the e-commerce channel for sales and support, rather than encouraging the usual out-the-door line-ups for Apple product launches.As Apple retail chiefAngela Ahrendts explained in an internal email to retail employees, the days of waiting in line and crossing fingers for a product are over for our customers, she said. Instead, Apple wants to customers to useits Apple Store app and its online store for their orders, which Ahrendts noted would requirea significant change in mindset.To make that transition more seamless for customers, Apple is offering customers the ability to engage face-to-face like theyre used to in Apple retail stores, but from the comfort of their own home. Not only does this help the often over-crowded retail store staff focus onaddressing more urgent customer needs likerepairs, or free them up to host moreclasses or spend more time with shoppers, it also means Apple can scale its customer support business to reach more customers, including those who dont live close toa retail store.Initially, the Apple Watch launch appeared to suffer from supply constraints as many customers who missed the pre-orderwindow on April 10 were given shipment dates in May or even June. But for many, this ended up as a case of Apple under-promising then over-delivering.

There was a ton of speculation about it and many people (including myself, I might add), wondered why anyone would need a tablet, when they had an iPhone in their pocket. We were all wrong of course, because what we couldnt predict was how this device would change computing forever.When you took away the keyboard from a device with a larger touch screen, something happened that nobody expected. For consumers, the bigger touch screen gave them new ways to interact with content. For business, you could work with customers by touching and swiping and as you talked, the device melted away in a way thats not possible with a laptop.It went so far as to change expectations of how software works and ushered in the Consumerization of IT. As :The elegance and ease of use of the device  and its amazing popularity, with more than 100 million sold in less than three years  has forced enterprise software architects to reevaluate how we interact with software.TechCrunchs Matthew Panzarino sees a similar dynamic happening once we strap the Apple Watch to our wrists. by keeping our phones mostly in our pockets. We will now subtly glance at our wrists instead of clumsily staring at our phones. That sounds a lot like the way the iPad changed the we work and the iPhone changed the way we think of phones., Samsung has dominated the nascent smart watch market with 78 percent revenue share. Pebble is a distant second with 18 percent. that translated into 800,000 units sold for Samsung and 300,000 for Pebble.As I wandered the halls of the Mobile World Congress last week, I saw lots of smart watches from phone makers and watch makers alike, but none has captured the imagination of the mass market to-date. Conventional wisdom says that if these devices havent made a big dent in the market, then why would Apple do better?TechRadar went so far as to call it .Thats one way to look at it I suppose, but whether it was the MP3 player, the smart phone or the tablet, history has shown when Apple turns its attention to a device, we should probably pay attention.Its impossible to predict if the Apple Watch will be a hit or a miss, but its probably worth giving the companythe benefit of the doubt. TechCrunchs John Biggs is brave enough to predict Heres my prediction: Consider that last quarter alone. If just 10 percent of those folks who bought iPhones last quarter buys the Apple Watch  and I dont think thats too bold an expectation  then Apple would sell 7.5M Watches this quarter.Consider that over the years we have witnessed crazy, irrational loyalty from the Apple user base, lining up on sidewalks (sometimes for days) for a chance to be the first to own the latest idevice. On curiosity alone, it makes sense that there are a percentage of those customers out there who will buy this device too, and given the size of the iPhone market that would translate into millions sold.Somewill scoff of course, and will say Apple has to fail sometime and maybe the Apple Watch is where it happens. But I say Apple has too much market momentum for that to happen and even a little will go a long way. Expect another win for Apple.", "title": "On Eve Of Apple Watch Launch, History On ApplesSide"},

The new watchincludes built-in GPS and alerts for parents as well as educational content and games for kids. Its initially available for $99, and will ship later this summer.Specifically, AmbyGears watch is aimed at children ages 3 to 11  when theyre too young to have a smartphone of their own, but at an age where they may either wander off, or still need to be in touch with their parents somehow.Today, there are a number of competitors building smartwatches for children, including devices likeFiLIP 2, , the , B-Ons , the, and many . But in somecases, companies in this space are focused on building watches that address parents needs to monitor and track their children, without offering things that the kids themselves might enjoy.With AmbyGear, however,the watch is a combination of a kid-tracker, parent-child communication device, anda source of mobile games for kids.Using the watchs built-in GPS, parents can locate their kids, as is typical with kids smartwatches, but in AmbyGears case,the reverse of that feature is also available  kids can use a Finder app to locate their parents in the event they become lost or just feel unsafe. Parents can also configure boundary alerts, which let them be notified if their childmoves outside a specific geo-fenced area.In addition, theres a unique kid-friendly texting function that lets parents send short messages to kids like which kids can respond to with just a tap in order to say .Parents are able to communicate and track their kids using the accompanying AmbyGear mobile app, which lets them configure the watch with new games and apps, as well as receive geo-fence alerts and tamper alerts which inform parents if the watch is being removed,and more.Another feature which will likely appeal to parents who have been struggling withthe decision as to whether or not to provide their older elementary or even middle school-aged child with a smartphone is the included calendar app. Instead of worrying if the child is remembering to make it their after-school activities, or getting frustrated because the child forgets to come insidein time for dinner, the watch instead can alert kidsto the days upcoming events. This feature also works with AmbyGears built-in reward system, so parents can use the watch to encourage good behavior.The reward system is a key feature of this watch, as it allows kids to collect points daily for their activities which can then be traded in for rewards set by parents, like extra allowance dollars, toys, trips or other small or large prizes.Kids can enjoy the watch too, by accessing a range of educational games which parents select based on the childs age. (The company notes it will open this up to third-party developers.) And the watch includes other educational content focused on teaching life lessons  like encouraging kindness, responsibility, physical activity, commitment, and more. For example, a Geo Caching (treasure hunt) app encourages kids to explore the outdoors while having fun finding hidden items.The watch itself offers a choice of brightly colored red, blue, green or white wristbands, a Sharp ultra low-power display,Bluetooth (up to 250 yards)and Wi-Fi connectivity (up to 500 yards), GPS with 33 tracking channels, a 3-axis accelerometer, a magnetometer, 4 colored LEDs, a Qi wireless charger and USB cord, and a 20dBm RF power amp. The display is easy to read in sunlight, and because of its low power consumption, allows the watch to have up to 7 days of battery life in between charges. The AmbyGear isalso waterproof and shock resistant, the company notes.Ambit Networks founder and CEO Patrick Muggler, a parent himself, experienced the problems of tracking down missing kids firsthand, having once lost his daughter in Home Depot for several long minutes. And a few years later, his wife lost their son while on a bike ride. Over 1,000 parents go through similar situations every day in the U.S., he says, noting that this is what the AmbyGear watch aims to solve.Prior to Ambit Networks, Muggler spent 15 years in the semiconductor and electronic business in roles ranging fromIC design to application support, business development, and product marketing at companies includingTexas Instruments, Maxim Integrated, Intersil and Power-One. During this time, he help companies includingNokia, Apple, Sony, Samsung, LG, HTC, and Sharp design their audio backend in their mobile phones, TVs and other consumer electronics.Ambit Networks co-founder and COO Arun Sharma, meanwhile, has 14 years experience in the semiconductor industry, also in IC design and product line management atcompanies such as Texas Instrument, Conexant and Audience.The $99 device will eventually retail for $129, butdoesnt require a monthly fee. The watches are expected to ship this summer.The Indiegogo campaign is hoping toraise another $50,000 to bring the watches to production, and comes on top of a small $110,000 round of friends and family funding.", "title": "AmbyGears New Smartwatch For Kids Combines GPS Tracking With EducationalGames"},

Butthe startup isnow taking thingsa stage further by crowdfunding (via ) a new version of the stool, called Zami Smart, which includes sensors that track how long youve been sitting. And a companion app designed to prompt you to move more.We actually saw a hack at theDisrupt NY hackathon just this weekend, called , that offered similar posture-tracking functionality but that was retrofitted to anexisting office chair. Zamis productsare a more expensive option starting at $299 for the basic model, or $379for the version with embedded sensors.So this is not acost-effective option for offices or individual consumers, but perhaps moreaesthetic  at least if you dig itsminimalist stool design. And dont work in an office with especially fancy chairs.Zamis founding team includesorthopedic surgeon Piete Van Loon and designerRuud-Jan Kokke.The new version of Zamisstool is designed to trackhow you sit via pressure sensors built into the legs, and it uses Bluetooth Low Energy to wirelessly offload data to acompanion app.The startup claims it can track posture, sitting periods and evenfine-grained detail about your behavior while seated  such as whether you fidget (should you feel the need to quantify that).The uses four active pressure sensors, one in each leg.Your legs, when placed on the ground, take some of the weight and provide two additional support points. The sensors and the algorithm in the application can detect all this, itexplains.Combined with an initial short setup to determine a persons weight and other vital metrics, the app uses the values of the sensors to detect all kinds of information.Among these is time spent sitting, quality of the sitting (your personal data and the weight distribution combined with original research data tells us in great detail about your posture, slouching, etc.), and behavior during sitting. (Lots of variation in the pressure sensors can indicate, for example, restless sitting or fidgeting, potential pressure point issues, etc).The app willalso keep track of how much you sit on other objects  or at least it will if you carry your phone with you in your pocket.On the motivational side, the Zami app will ping users who are slouching or who have been sitting for too long, encouraging you to get up and stretch your legs. It will also include suggestions for exercises to do with the Zami itself, such as this awesome yoga backbend:Zami says it plans to aggregate userssitting data in the cloud, allowingcomparisons with othersof similarweight, or perhaps age bracket.It says thisdata will be anonymized, but if you dont like the idea of a chair that informs how much of a couch potato you are, then this Internet-of-Things-device-in-the-making is not for you.The device is aprototype, with Zami targeting $30,000 in crowdfunding withtheir just launched campaign in order to get the seat to market  aiming for a December shipping schedule.", "title": "This Pressure-Sensing Stool Wants You To SitBetter"},

The earliest backers on Kickstarter can pick up the flashlight for $175 without a module or for $225 with a walkie-talkie. After the early-bird specials end, both of those prices go up by $25.After the walkie-talkie, Fogo plans on releasing caps for the flashlight that will include a satellite modem, laser rangefinder, or avalanche beacon. Fogo co-founder Tyler Gilbert told me last week that the satellite modem is top priority, and that the startup aims to release it early next year. Other modules will follow throughout 2016.Theres been a slight aesthetic change to the Fogos exterior design since we last saw it: the stainless steel bezelaround the screen has been replaced with hardened plastic in order to boost the GPSs reception. The company is also working on adapters for the flashlight for Garmin and GoPro mounts  if the campaign hits a stretch goal, Fogo plans to throw them in the box when they ship to consumers. If not, theyll sell them separately after the campaign ends.On the software side of things, Gilbert also explained a new feature called Active Battery Management.

The Crescent Bay model I played with at CES earlier this year didnt include features like noise cancellation, so theres still obvious areas to improve on that aspect of the integrated experience over time.On the tracking front, the Crescent Bay demo proved that Oculus can provide nigh-perfect camera-based tracking when you limit the space you can move around in to a four-foot by four-foot square. If you look outside the Oculus ecosystem to the , the technology is already out there to allow for a full-on Holodeck-style I can walk around in this space experience that gives you as much as a living rooms worth of space.The visuals issue is a little trickier. There are a few main ways Oculus can improve the graphics in the Oculus Rift headset as it exists today. The easiest method is to simply improve the hardware on the PC side of the equation: If you throw a better graphics card in the desktop powering your headset, you can get more dynamic shadows, more polygons and prettier textures in your games at the same screen resolution without a drop in performance.Thats basically what Oculus has been doing with each of its public demos. Every time Ive gone in for one, Ive been able to get the engineer running the session to brag about the GPU theyre using (at CES it was a ~$600 Geforce GTX 980). But in the long run Oculus is going to improve the optics and display in the headset itself.Even in the impressive Crescent Bay prototype, youve only got a 90-degree field of vision, while your eyes are normally capturing 280 degrees. To remove this binocular effect (and any visible pixels in your vision), youd need better lenses and a display with a resolution higher than even Apples new , which starts at $2,499. Its not hard to imagineOculus getting closer to that ideal spec over the next several years, but itll happen with gradual iteration and improvement (and will require early adopters to keep buying high-end rigs for development and gaming).The haptic side of things is perhaps the most difficult to address. Oculus has yet to demonstrate an official control mechanism for the Rift, instead letting each developer use the peripherals they find most suitable. During his keynote, however, Abrash noted that [he expects] hands to be as capable in VR as they are in the real world in just a few years. That could be a hint at something along the lines of , which embeds a camera at the front of your head-mounted display.However, the slide Abrash showed during the keynote specifically noted haptics, which means Oculus is thinking not only about tracking hands to interact with virtual worlds, but having the world interact back  letting you feel the things you reach out to touch. Its one thing to expect people to strap on a headset for any amount of time, but gloves and other hardware solutions to VR haptics require extra bulk and maybe even charging another set of peripherals. But if it works, haptics in your VR controllers could make experiences far more immersive than even the best projects weve seen to date.Its a big challenge thats easy to mess up, so itll be interesting to see whether Oculus can figure out something consumers will buy into later this year, or if its a longer-term issue to be addressed in future iterations.", "title": "The Biggest Challenges Left In Virtual Reality, According ToOculus"},

Crowd GPS is TrackRs solution for getting around the fact that its essentially impossible to cram a GPS into a device this size and get the months of battery you can squeeze out of Bluetooth LE.Instead of spending more power to deal with the rare occasion that you lose your Bravo after your phone dies, TrackR has made it so that other phones running its app can see devices from the Crowd GPS list and ping you with the latest location.Its a clever solution, but requires the company to pick up a lot more traction before you can feel confident that your device will be discovered.I personally found the TrackR most useful right inside my apartment, which is currently in a state of organized chaos. Everything looks like a mess, but its all in the right place. The problem with this mode of organization is that eventually you forget which bin holds that backup pair of headphones. With the TrackR stuck to them, I could simply swipe over to the headphone item, give it a tap, and hear the Bravo give out a sharp alert. In the case that you misplace your phone but not your keys, you can also press the Bravo to set off an alert from your iPhone.The range you can get on the TrackR Bravo is about what youd expect from a device relying on Bluetooth LE. Depending on what structures are between your phone and the radio, you can expect to maintain communication between devices from 25 to 40 feet away.The TrackR Bravo isnt alone in the Bluetooth tracker space, with options like offering similar functionality in the same general price range. If youre one for aesthetics, I give points to the Bravo for its clean aluminum look, though it can get beat up when attached to keys.Most tracker manufacturers give deep discounts when ordering several (and youre probably going to need to register several devices before thinking to check it is second-nature), so if the idea appeals to you its best to jump in by getting enough to track most of your smaller valuables.", "title": "The TrackR Bravo Keeps You From Misplacing YourValuables"},

The feature that should get some attention is speed and boundary alerts on your wrist. Looking back on my teen driver years (which were right before we were all super-connected with smartphones), my parents had no idea where the heck I was most afternoons or how responsible I was with the several-ton hunk of metal on wheels they so graciously provided for me.With the Car-Net app, you can set up alerts when a specific driver in the family exceeds a set speed cap or leaves a certain location boundary. Just having that on your phone is fantastic for a parent, but its easy to lose notifications in the deluge of things pinging you on your phone.The Apple Watch is a different story  the point is to prune incoming notifications down to just the updates that matter most. Assuming you actually put in that effort, the Car-Net messages will really stand out; if they get too annoying, its probably time to have a chat with the teen about safe driving or keeping you in the loop about their whereabouts.The other feature that I could see being regularly handy is remote unlocking from the Watch (for cars from the 2016 model year). Yes, we already have fobs for unlocking doors or popping the trunk as we walk up to our cars, but just as Apple Pay on the Watch keeps you from getting out your phone or wallet to pay in line while carrying bags or anantsy toddler, eliminating the need to dig into a coat pocket or bag to find your keys should eliminate a common frustration.", "title": "Volkswagens Apple Watch App Will Notify You When Your Teen DriverSpeeds"},

Thats a sign that wearable tech is coming of age in some ways, but this represents the awkward teen years, not the arrival of adulthood and maturity. The announcements at this event felt like when the music stops in a game of musical chairs, not like the culmination of a focused plan.Wearable tech is an extremely promising area for hardware and software alike, but also one where weve seen a fair number of false starts. The Dick Tracy watch vision has led to multiple wrist-phone creations, dating back to before even the advent of the iPhone. Dedicated activity trackers had their own moment in the sun, before hitting a wall just shy of wide adoption, owing in part to limited functionality, and also to design and taste compunctions among consumers.Its still not a mass-market technology by any means, however, and it needs a key success to become more prevalent in its own right, and to inspire a world in which wearable tech has more tangible benefits in terms of interaction with the world around us. The Apple Watch is the most promising wearable to date in terms of having a broad, positive impact on the state of the category, but the rush from others to try to capitalize on or re-route some of its success may have a net negative effect on wearable tech in general.This mornings announcements included a partnership between to put Android Wear inside watch bodies that, though price wasnt announced, are likely to range in from between$5,000 and $10,000 ( at Tags press site, by the way). Serial gadget failtrepreneur will.i.am has also announced a partnership with Gucci Timepieces to produce a wearable gadget thats also a fashion accessory, and the press release announcing the news actually contains the word fashionology used without irony.The point is that companies are frantic for partners that will offer some kind of legitimacy, which they must view as a shortcut to broader adoption. Wearables are worn, goes the theory, therefore well look to the leaders in product markets like fashion and high-end watches to solve the adoption problem, which will in turn solve the software problem, and then also the wider problem of integrating wearable tech intelligently into a connected world.Partners need convincing in order to build a network of services and device to talk to wearables, after all, and if wearables arent worn, its much harder to turn their head.The problem is that simple addition doesnt address the underlying problems facing wearables; you cant just add technology to fashion and expect fashionology to come out the other end, in other words. A hasty union stands to do more harm than good, since dissatisfied purchasers of these devices will end up trusting each element less, and will be twice as shy about adopting anything wearable in the future.Apples approach to smartwatches is really the only one with promise not just because it has the brand to sell hardware regardless of what is is, as some have suggested, but also because its focusing on the problem of wearables as a cohesive and complex one, not something that can be addressed by a rough-hewn partnership of two companies who understand in isolation individual aspects of the challenge.The potential for a wearables future is one of seamless integration, when the tech youre wearing interacts with everything around you in a way that significantly reduces friction and ultimately results in an environment that is tailored to you, and that anticipates your needs. To get there, however, we need consumers not to be wary of the category as a whole, and that means not producing half-realized devices birthed from unlikely unions.", "title": "The Rush To Find A Dance Partner Is Causing A WearablesMisstep"},

However its not their aim to become an educational content company per se.Rather, saysRoozeboom, theywant to provide astarting point and then hand that over to acommunity of educators to plug its capabilitiesinto curriculum requirements.We want to build high quality science content to get users started, but our goal is to be more like Little Bits, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi, where we enable open-ended exploration. Our core competencies are in the hardware, app, and cloud software development, he adds.We have done a lot of user testing in the AP physics classes at Leigh High School and have used PocketLab with two physics classes and two mechanical engineering classes at Stanford.

It deserves the same level of innovation that entrepreneurs apply to consumer electronics, he adds.Initialfunding for the project came from prize money from two business plan competitions: Yale School of Management Education Leadership Conference and Stanford BASES, says Roozeboom. The team has alsorecently raised asmall angel round of funding to cover some of their engineering costs.On Kickstarter they are looking to raise $25,000 but have already surpassed that goal, with almost $30,000 now pledged and another 29 days left of their campaign to run.The plan is to ship PocketLab to backers inJune.", "title": "PocketLab Is Simplified Wireless Sensing For ScienceClass"},

The screen has Retina resolution of 23041440, with a 16:10 aspect ratio, and the computer has just one port for power and data input/output (plus a 3.5mm stereo jack for headsets). It really is, top to bottom, a computer that pushes the edge of technical advancement forward, and Apples decision to call it simply the MacBook signals that this is the way of the future.In person, the computers technical achievements are even more stunning than they were on stage. The notebook weighs only around 2 lbs, which is amazingly only about half a pound heavier than the original iPad. Holding it in the hand tricks your mind into thinking its even lighter, though, thanks to that larger display and the fact that you remember its actually a notebook.The screen also looks unbelievable given what you might expect were the technical limitations that come along with making something so thin. The display looks printed on, with a resolution that renders text really well and looks a lot brighter, bolder, and more color-accurate than the original Retina MBP by quite a bit. Again, this is a screen built into something that is essentially not much thicker than a file folder.Apple has still included a full-size keyboard in this device, but it has used a new key process to create a keyboard with less travel, wider keys and less space between keys. Typing on the new MacBook feels good, though, with a satisfying click still present despite the shorter travel distance. Apple says this is because the keys click downward evenly across the key with the new mechanism, and limited hands-on testing seems to back that up.The touch pad may be one of the more amazing feats in this machine, however, because despite only ever moving a total of 7 nanometers, it feels like its a clicky, button-like trackpad with real travel. Thats because it has customizable force feedback, which lets users say just how much the taptic engine beneath will respond to clicks. This proves amazing when youre doing something like force pressing (applying more pressure) to quickly skim through video  you can actually feel the keypad providing you with subtle but distinct cues that its working.Further testing will answer the question of whether Apples right that you dont need additional ports to get your work and personal computing tasks done anymore, but I can say that the MacBook definitely lives up to its initial promise of being an amazingly thin and light device with very cool features that reimagine basics like keyboard illumination and trackpad input.", "title": "Hands On With The All-New Ultra Thin MacBook With RetinaDisplay"},

Not only can you play piano, violin, guitar or loop beats as a DJ, you can also mix up the way you play those instruments. You can play the guitar with the sounds of piano keys or play the piano with the sounds of abanjo, for instance.Artiphon is also creating a companion app so that you can literally program the device to become any instrument you want it to be.Any number of combinations can be used, said founder Mike Butera.The idea for the Artiphon INSTRUMENT 1 came about one day while Butera was on the road with his band.I was carrying a viola, cello, guitar, an electric guitar, all these instruments and it was hard to lug all that around. I got to thinking about GarageBand. It can sound like anything because its software. I wanted something like that to exist as an instrument, hesaid.It just so happens that Butera also holds a PhD in sound studies and was a product developer for stereo systems at the time  technical skills that enabled him to dream up what this sort of instrument would look like.It took four years and many iterations before the product came to be what we see today. An earlier version debuted .AOL founder Steve Case liked the idea and gave Butera some investment money for research and development. Dave McClure, Eric Reis and a some musical angels from Nashville were on board as well. Butera took in a total of $700,000, hired a team of engineers, brought in his co-founder and CMO Jacob Gordon and started testing the product out on various musicians.Bands such as The Weeks, Wild Cub, Moon Taxi, Mikki Ekko (who produced Rihannas Stay} and even Moby have given the product a spin.Most Kickstarter campaigns dont start out with this much support. We were told by Kickstarter that we were 99 percent ahead of most campaigns, actually, Butera said.So why a Kickstarter campaign for something with so much backing already? Part of it is about getting the idea out there for marketing purposes. Kickstarter provides that platform for Butera and his team to reach the potentially interested masses. But it can also provide that extra bit needed to get the product into production.Hardware is pretty intense, Butera said. The angel funding helps with the R&D process but we needed working capital to manufacture it.The Artiphon campaignis reminiscent of in some ways. For those unfamiliar, the is an interactive digital guitar that helps beginners learn to play using an app on their iPhone. The GTar went $250,000 . The difference is Artiphon can simplify for beginners, but can also become virtually any musical instrument it is programmed to be. Its also in a later funding stage than where GTar was when that campaign ended.Wecould also see this instrument on the shelves at our local Apple Stores in the next year. Butera confirmed his company is in discussions with Apples retail arm and that he plans to add the INSTRUMENT 1 to other retail outlets by late 2016.The Artiphon crew will be traveling to the film, interactive and music festival this next week to share the instrument with festival attendees. Well probably have some great spontaneous performances there, too, said Butera.", "title": "The Artiphon INSTRUMENT 1 Is A Symphony, Rock Band And DJ In The Palm Of YourHand"},

It didnt need the headaches or being called the NSA of gadgets.It decided to go off quietly into the sunset. Google shut down , that exclusive group, where for$1500 you could play and experiment with Glass  be a sociallab rat. Glass didnt like that role and it decided enough was enough.Of course, it didnt hurt that Glasss boss had had enough too. The whole consumer thing wasnt happening for Glass. Google knew it. The experiment seemed toburn out after theinitial burst of excitement. The thrill was gone. It was time to move on.Googles Chief Financial Officer during the companys January earnings call.Pichette was fairly pragmatic describing the projects failings when asked about Glass during the January call.When teams arent able to [leap] hurdles, but we think theres still a lot of promise, we might ask them to take a pause and take the time to reset their strategy, as we recently did in the case of Glass, Pichette said.But then he said something else, perhaps it was off the cuff, a bit of insight into how Google decides what to keep and what to discard. But it raised some eyebrowsjust by saying it.[A]nd in those situations where projects dont have the impact we hope for, we do take the tough calls, we make the decision to cancel them, and youve seen us do this time and time again, Pichette said on the earnings call.That sounded more like a subtle threat, a warning that Glass needed to find its footing sooner than later  and Google was only going to give the project so much leeway.Thats when Glass decided it was time to pivot. Surely, it had been working quietly with a bunch of companies even before the decision to axe the consumer program, people who saw commercial potentialwhere others saw pervs with cameras on their faces.Glass is alive and well. Despite the CFOs comments [in January], the Glass team is growing, Kyle Samani, who is CEO at , a company devoted to commercializing Google Glass wrote in an email.Samani surmised that perhaps Pichette was referring to the idea of a consumer product, but he sawGoogle steadfastly supporting Glass as a business tool.Google is working more closely with us than ever before and is committed to the success of Glass in the enterprise. They are supporting our aggressive growth plans actively, he wrote.Jay Kim, Chief Technology Office at APX Labs, a company that has developed an agnostic software development platform for wearablesincluding Glass, told TechCrunch Google was still selling Glass in bulk to its partners.Maybe thats why Glass decided to go where its appreciated, and thats business where users can walk around using Glass to do their jobs and nobody will beat them up or make fun of them.People might actually get called out for not wearing it because it could help themdo theirjob better.Maybe even Pichette would see its value in a business setting. Perhaps under the leadership of Nests Tony Fadell, Glass would get the kind of attention it deserved. Maybe it would even flourish.Nobody likes to be underappreciated, least of all Glass, so its moved to business.And its doing just fine.

A few hours, right? revealed a solution onstage today at TechCrunch Disrupt NY that can charge a phone in minutes. With this technology, the company aims to allow a Tesla can be fully recharged in the amount of time it takes to pump a tank of gas.The company says its suite of battery technologies, called Intelligent Energy System, can change the way energy is stored and transferred while also extending the life of the battery, and is ready to be applied to batteries in the next generation of devices.The promise is radical yet the companys founders have a long history in this field. Ian Hunter founded Nucleus Scientific in 2007 and is the Hatsopoulos Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT and head of the Bioinstrumentation Laboratory.The rest of the team is a mix of PhDs in chemistry, physics and engineering, and many are from MIT. Disrupt NY is the firms first public demonstration after operating under the radar for the last eight years; itrevealed an engineering prototype power bank to demonstrate itsadvancements.The company wants to license the patented technology and isalready in talks with several established companies about incorporating their hardware and software solution into existing and future product lines.This power bank is similar to others on the market but features radically different capabilities. Its incredible, really. The 10,000 mAh engineering prototype can fully charge in 15 minutes instead of the hours usually required. That means the power bank is pulling and storing enough energy from a standard wall outlet at a rate that would recharge a smartphone in three minutes.The company also produced a working system for an electric scooter battery. Traditionally, to charge a battery required for a 12km ride would take 280 minutes; its only 10 minutes with Nucleus Scientifics solution.Nucleus Scientifics Intelligent Energy System marries hardware breakthroughs with custom software to achieve their results. The complete system of custom batteries, sensors, feedback control systems and algorithms not only allows for unheard of charge times, but also extends the life of the battery.The company constructed a large battery testing facility to build-out this technology. In the lab, the company recharged 14,000 mAh batteries (equal to ninesmartphones) in 100 seconds. But if the charge time is increased to three minutes, the company was able to double the life of the battery.Today, the most commonly used method to charge batteries is called Constant-Current Constant-Voltage (CCCV). Its recharging scheme is hard on batteries, ultimately limiting its life. Instead of applying a constant current to the batteries like in CCCV, real-time monitoring of the battery is used to regulate the voltage charging the battery, extending the life of the battery. The efficiency of the system even allows for the design of radically smaller power chargers, reducing the size of a standard 100W power converter by a factor of six times.Nucleus Scientific says the technology is ready to be applied to various configurations of lithium-ion and lithium polymer batteries. The concept isnt limited to small batteries, either  the firm says they plan to scale the technology from smartphone batteries to electric vehicles.Batteries are often the limiting factor of portable devices and Nucleus Scientific seemingly has a solution that will unlock the full potential of everything from smartphones to lanterns to medical equipment.", "title": "Nucleus Scientific Launches To RevolutionizeBatteries"},

(.) It also offers a home-base that tracksthe Iota over a distance of up to four miles.The products are strictly for right now. The company estimated that they will begin shipping to customers from May 2015.We got the idea from looking at Craigslist, where there were postings for at least 50 lost pets just in the Bay Area alone, Iotera CEOBen Wild told TechCrunch in an interview.Ioterastarted out four years ago, compelledby the poor battery life of GPS trackers at the time  which typically ran for a couple of days between charges  and the service charges for using them  which, Wild said, including the cost of the device, can run to$500 over a few years.Its devices are more ambitious than merely tracking, and are not just for pets, according to Wild. The Iota can last for months without charge because it runs on wireless protocols that the team designed from scratch (rather than using battery-draining, smartphone-designed cellular connections).Its companion smartphone app offersa range of notifications that are customized for different uses  such as tracking pets, detecting new mail in a post box, tracking the opening of door, and more. Things get more interesting, however, when you look at the community-based network of Iota devices.The home-baseslink up with one another. Planting a few in close proximity creates a coverage area for tracking devices beyond a customers specific home-base. That means that, for example, I can track my kids whereabouts beyond my immediate neighborhood without having to pay $10/$20 in monthly service charges.We can cover entire cities with a handful of home-bases, Wild explained. Less than 20 would beenough for San Francisco, for example.Data from the company suggests that, once the devices ship, there are already wideIotera coverage networks in San Francisco.While the networks share coverage, the data in each Iota is encrypted, even when it passes through a home-base. Thats important because it means thatthird partiescant hackinto the system via a customers home-base, Wild said.The company is scaling up right now, Wild said that its four-person team will increase to seven with the funding under its belt. Iotera isnt looking to monetize beyond the sale of trackers and home-bases at this point, but Wild admittedthere could beseveralrevenue-generation opportunities in the future.Location-based ads, served via the Iotera network, could be one option. While the network could be opened up to selected third parties, too, he said. Wild cautioned that ads should add value to users, so hopefully that means the company will be selective with what it serves howeverthere are no immediate plans to pursue suchstrategies at this point.Its very easy to get distracted [with an internet-of-things project]because there are literally so many things you can do, he said, pointing out that the company is currently focused on developing the customer experience.One area that being considered is international expansion. Wild wouldlike to see thedevices sold in Europe in early 2016 and he said that there are early discussions with potential partners in China and Japan. These international efforts would probably require an additional funding round, however. Wild estimated that this round should give Iotera around 12 months of runway before it needs to raise again.", "title": "Iotera Raises $1 Million For Its Super Simple GPS TrackingDevice"},

LVMH Watch Group head is not a man to ignore pop culture and all that is modern even though he made his money running companies that sell traditional, mechanical watches. Today, sitting as the CEO of Swiss watchmaker , he stands with representatives from Intel and Google announcing the first ever Android Wear-powered Swiss smartwatch. As recently as 2014 Jean-Claude Biver was an outspoken critic of smartwatches and what he felt was a slim value proposition to consumers of traditional watches whose marketing strategy often falls on offering a product that consumers can wear for many years. Biver and some of his colleagues have been extremely quick to point out that in their opinion the major failing of smartwatches is that consumers are asked to buy something potentially expensive that they will feel inclined to shelve as soon as something better comes out. Jean-Claude Biver is regularly referred to as one of the smartest and most dynamic people in todays luxury watch industry and he has been able to open the entire industry up to new ideas. Much of Mr. Bivers success has credited to adopting new ideas and taking risks. His branding touched on the previously untapped worlds of luxury watch marketing and he spearheaded an effort to sell to the the hip hop music industry as well as the worlds of basketball and football. Now, this outspoken critic of the Apple Watch is behind a fresh collaboration that seeks to embed the smartwatch as a permanent part of the Swiss watch industry landscape.Over the last few months, Jean-Claude Bivers tone regarding the acceptability of smartwatches began to change. For Mr. Biver it now seems as though smartwatches are not the anathema of the mechanical watch industry, but instead a diversification path that the Swiss watch industry would be foolish to ignore. Tech companies who have released smartwatches have been widely criticized for (among other things) creating products that do not feel or look like the timepieces anyone actually wants to wear. Ive personally suggested in the past that one successful formula for making the smartwatch relevant (and even exciting) is to combine the mutual talents of the Swiss watch industry and Silicon Valley. This seems to be precisely what TAG Heuer has done in partnership with Intel and Googles Android Wear operating system.Arguably one of Wears most serious challenges the dearth of actually attractive and useful smartwatch devices. Tech companies may try to emulate the look and feel of a traditional watch but none other than Apple have come even close to matching the quality, design, and detailing of a Swiss timepiece. Is there a market for a finely designed, premium smartwatch product that can compete on the same playing field as what is currently being made by the top timepiece brands from Europe?TAG Heuer seems to think so, and may be a less than surprising partner for companies such as Intel who has dabbled in the wearables world but has yet to make a real splash. Back in 2008 when TAG Heuer was perhaps at the height of diversifying its brand, in addition to making timepieces TAG Heuer was actually producing other products like eyewear and luxury smartphones. Thats right: for a moment they tried to sell the Meridiist, a ritzy phone meant to compete with the lifestyle mobile phones made by Vertu. TAG Heuer even went so far as to produce a smartwatch already  if you want to call it that. In 2013 the brand worked with Oracle Team USA during the Americas Cup to produce a small run of connected electronic watches known as the Aquaracer 72. These digital watches helped sailors see immediate and real time data about their ship while competing.Bringing a smartwatch to market for a mainstream set of consumers is a different challenge than working for a well-funded team of a few people you are sponsoring the efforts (Larry Ellisons Americas Cup sailing team) or producing a fancier version of an establish product like the cellphone. For instance, no one ever claimed that luxury smartphones were better than average phone, in many situations they are much worse. That was simply a different type of market than todays still new smatwatch industry. Whether or not the new TAG Heuer smartwatch will be a good smartwatch is actually less important than how quickly consumers overall adopt smartwatches. Once these new, connected wearable devices hit the mainstream there will quickly be a separation between those for most people, and those produced for the luxury buying demographic  and various companies have their own perspective on that. Recently, Swiss company Frederique Constant partnered with Fullpowers Motion X technology to produce the MMT Horological Smartwatch platform that seeks to turn a traditional looking analog-dial timepiece into an activity tracker. Without a clear preference by consumers a successful smartwatch platform is something that is companies are looking to find. TAG Heuer takes the more typical approach to the smartwatch solution by going directly with a digital screen combined with their own high-end case construction and sense of modern, edgy styling. Heres hoping they pull it off.", "title": "TAG Heuers Android Move Means Switzerland Is Embracing TheSmartwatch"},

It can see what youre working on for eight feet to the left and to the right, giving you plenty of space to work in knowing itll all be saved for later.Writing with the Smartmarker feels like working with any other erasable marker because thats exactly what youre doing  instead of including a proprietary ink cartridge you have to swap out every few weeks, the Equil lets you drop in any marker youd pick up in a 12-pack for a few bucks at Staples.Instead of packing a bunch of smart guts into the marker itself, most of the work is handled by the base station. Its got storage for somewhere around 1,000 whiteboards worth of notes, and connects to your phone, tablet, or laptop over Bluetooth.With that said, there are some nifty functions on the marker itself. Towards the non-writing end of each marker case, theres a small ring of blue, red or black. This is actually an interchangeable piece of plastic that determines the color ink used for the digital notes, so if you want notes by different people to show up more distinctly, you can have them use different color rings.For those who frequently misspell or have trouble drawing straight lines, theres also a smart eraser cap for the marker that wipes your work away from both the physical surface and the file in the app. There will also be a separate eraser puck to do the same thing if you need to wipe bigger swaths of notes away quickly.Speaking of the app, a new Note Stream featurecould be what makes the Smartmarker a must-have for some teams. While youre writing on the whiteboard, you can now have the app send recordings of notes to other Equil users in near real-time.This allows for conference calls with whiteboarding for drawing out concepts without requiring everyone touse a teleconferencing app that looks like it was made by a mediocre Java engineer with a long checklist of features to include and no real grasp on UX.

The Pebble Time is also compatible with the 6,500+ apps the community made for the original Pebble, though those wont take advantage of the new timeline interface.Rather than give users the option to use any standard wristband (as Pebble and most Android OEMS have done), Apple is offering its own bands, with fancier Milanese and link bands serving as up-sell options in the place of storage or processing power. Thats probably more convenient for someone looking to jump right into having something that looks nice, though prior watch fanatics might miss the ability to use their own bands.While some Android OEMs have started to push materials like stainless steel to provide a more premium heft and feel, Apple is still the only smartwatch maker with a genuine gold option for those looking for a luxury timepiece. If youre willing to drop $10,000, the Apple Watch Edition might be for you  that, or you could buy every other smartwatch that comes outover the next few years.Right now, its pretty easy to tell most people which smartwatch you should get. Hardcore iPhone user? Get an Apple Watch. Love the customization features in Android? Pick an Android Wear device on the Google Play Store.Dont think you spend too much time on your phone? You probably dont need either.Notably, Pebbles watches are your best option if you see yourself switching between mobile operating systems, since youll be able to make the switch without buying new gear for your wrist.", "title": "The Apple Watch Compared To TheCompetition"},

Its only available in China right now but the company tells TechCrunch its looking at European markets to consider whether to bringthe N1 here too.Announced last November, the slender, almost 8-inchisa brand licensing collaboration between Nokia and Chinese electronics manufacturing firmFoxconn. Its not clear how the revenue share breaks down  and Nokia wouldnt specify when we asked  but its definitely doing less of the heavy lifting, with Foxconn making the hardware and also handling distribution, sales and marketing. Nokia contributes design work, itsbrand name andAndroid launcher, also revealedlast year.Nokias Tuukka Jrvenp, lead product manager of brand licensing, said theworked with Foxconn on the tablets design. The N9 was a refreshingly different, round-edged smartphonereleased to admiring looks back in 2011.The same design was subsequently pushed onto Nokias early Windows Phone devices. Nokia is now recycling some of that design language for a second timewith the N1.In the flesh the aluminum-clad N1 tablet has a premium look and feel. Indeed, the minimalist styling could pass for Apple hardware. This is perhaps not surprising, given that Apple also uses Foxconn as a manufacturing partner. Nokias Jrvenp says Nokiasaim isto createanon-intrusive design,which boils down tominimalhardware clutter. The tablets focal point is a bright and clear2,048 x 1,536 display.The same pared back principle extends to NokiasZ launcher software which sitson top of Android 5.0 (Lollipop). Jrvenp saysNokia has kept this feature-light to ensure users arent waiting too long for future Android updates.The two main Z launcherfeatures are an adaptive apps view thatchanges whichapp icons appear on your homescreen, based on your app usage; and a shortcut search thatlets you scribble out the first letter of whatever youre looking for on the homescreen and have results pulled in from across the tablet rather than having to wrangle with a full Qwerty keyboard or go hunting in the app drawer. In there, the apps are arranged alphabetically, adding to the softwares neat and tidy aura.Both device and UI feel intentionally lightweight  and refreshingly uncluttered. And theres no ugly looking widgets, or evidence of UI lag (during a brief hands on), as has been the case with Android tablets in years past.On the specs front, Nokia says the N1 offers a performance bump over the iOS small slate equivalent, the iPad Mini, with a quad-core chip, 2GB of RAM and 32GB of on board storage. The pricing is also aggressive, at around $250. But all that good stuff canstill only entice Chinese buyers at this point.It remains to be seen whether Nokias N1tablet ends up being a China-only experiment. The version on show here in Barcelona has Google Play pre-loaded but the actual product sold in Asia comes with a Chinese app store, as is common in the market.At this stage the N1 isevidently an experiment for Nokia as it refocuses its business after selling off its devices and services division to Microsoft last year. As part of the sale, Nokia agreed not to put its brand name on phones until 2016. But that hasnt stopped it christening tablet hardware.And with the ban on Nokia-branded phones set to lift in a year, Nokia may well be using the N1as a stepping stone to prepare the ground for launching a line of Android based smartphonesnext year, in collaboration with Foxconn.If it is planning to bring Nokia-brandedsmartphones back to the market in 2016, the well-crafted, quality feel of thisDesigned In Finland, made in China tabletcertainly augurs well.

So youre out of luck if you throw it in the deep end. Next, salt water is not advised and the phone should only occasionally be in chlorinated water, and it needs to be rinsed off afterward. And of course, before the phone is recharged, the USB port needs to be dry.The M4 Aqua will have a starting price of 299 EUR and will be available in 80 countries, but not the U.S. Sony tells us that the company is focusing on its flagship offering in the States.The M4 Aqua is only waterproof to a point.

Features like remote control of climate settings, checking if you left your windows open or where you parked, and fuel/battery monitoring are all available from iOS and Android apps (which, if were being honest, have design elements from both platforms that make it look really odd), and as soon as the new update rolls out theyll be on your wrist, too.All of those features are nifty, but not what I would call must-haves. The feature that should get some attention is speed and boundary alerts on your wrist. Looking back on my teen driver years (which were right before we were all super-connected with smartphones), my parents had no idea where the heck I was most afternoons or how responsible I was with the several-ton hunk of metal on wheels they so graciously provided for me.With the Car-Net app, you can set up alerts when a specific driver in the family exceeds a set speed cap or leaves a certain location boundary. Just having that on your phone is fantastic for a parent, but its easy to lose notifications in the deluge of things pinging you on your phone.The Apple Watch is a different story  the point is to prune incoming notifications down to just the updates that matter most. Assuming you actually put in that effort, the Car-Net messages will really stand out; if they get too annoying, its probably time to have a chat with the teen about safe driving or keeping you in the loop about their whereabouts.The other feature that I could see being regularly handy is remote unlocking from the Watch (for cars from the 2016 model year). Yes, we already have fobs for unlocking doors or popping the trunk as we walk up to our cars, but just as Apple Pay on the Watch keeps you from getting out your phone or wallet to pay in line while carrying bags or anantsy toddler, eliminating the need to dig into a coat pocket or bag to find your keys should eliminate a common frustration.", "title": "Volkswagens Apple Watch App Will Notify You When Your Teen DriverSpeeds"},

He spoke to about the companys first smart wearableandtalked about what will motivate a purchase decision for the Apple Watch now, and why itll only get more attractive as time goes on.Cook told the that he suspects an initial driver for sales will be that consumers want the Apple Watch as a fashion statement, and the company has clearly been hard at work setting up the accessory in that light. The watch is also incredibly accurate, Cook reminds us, able to keep time within 50 milliseconds of variation. But the apps are the real story, and in the end the Apple Watch is still a convenience accessory  with the opportunity to become even more powerful in that regard once its present in the real world in a sizeable population, which will drive integrations with more of the other devices that we use on a daily basis.In the Telegraph interview, Cook offers the example of the Apple Watch replacing your cars physical keys or dedicated fob. Its a powerful use case to propose because its immediately apparent that if one already has an Apple Watch for the benefits of notifications and communication it offers, migrating the functions of other dedicated gadgets with similar radio and sensor loadouts to the wearable makes a ton of sense.Smartwatches are already pretty abundant, but the difference an Apple Watch can offer isnt limited to just Apples ability to take existing concepts and refine the hardware and software experience into something people are actually going to enjoy and find indispensable. It also has the power to effect complementary changes in adjacent industries, thanks to its ability to sell devices at great scale. A car maker might not currently see why they should offer Android Wear compatibility, for instance, but once there are even 5million Apple Watches in circulation in the U.S., as a blind example, such functionality becomes a value-added selling feature for potential owners.A car key fob is low-hanging fruit, in that it would probably require very little work to make a reality, at least in terms of technical changes required. But you can easily see how appliance makers, smart home platform operators, public transit corporations, airlines, hotels and more might start to see the benefits of setting up communication with a device worn by a fair portion of their clients and consumers  and a group thats generally more free with their spending than other demographics, on top of that.The Apple Watch has enough hype, style and substance to be a success out of the gate, but the longer-term story that will be told once sales volume moves adjacent markets is the most interesting in terms of broader impact for our everyday lives.", "title": "Tim Cook Says Apple Watch Could Replace Your Car Keys, And Thats Just TheStart"},

Multiple sources close to the matter confirm the round, which was oversubscribed and values the company at north of nine figures.The funding was led by the Silicon Valley billionaires club that operates a cross between a family office and venture capital firm.While Iconiq may not be a household name, revealed peoplelike Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz and Sheryl Sandberg, Twitters Jack Dorsey, LinkedIns Reid Hoffman and other big names were on its roster.In addition to Iconiq, Li Ka-shings and Pritzker Group VCalso participated along withseveralprivate individuals. This new round follows the companys $10 million Series A from Horizons, bringing thetotal funding to date to $22.5 million.Viv Labs declined to comment on the investment.We understand that Viv Labswas not in need of new capital, but wasrather attracted to the possibilities that working with Iconiq Capital provided. It was a round that was more opportunistic in nature, and was executed to accelerate the vision for the Viv product, which is meant to not only continue Siris original vision, but to actually surpass it in a number of areas.Vivs co-founders,Dag Kittlaus,Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham, had previously envisioned Siri as an AI interface that would become the gateway to the entire Internet, parsing and understanding peoples queries which were spoken using natural language.When Siri first launched its product, it supported 45services, but ultimately the team wanted to expand it with the help of third parties to access the tens of thousands of APIs available on the Internet today.That didnt come to pass, because for $200 million back in 2010. The AI revolution the team once sought was left unfinished,and Siri became a device-centric product  one that largely connects users to Apples services and other iOS features. Sirican only do what its been programmed to do, and when it doesnt know an answer, it kicks youout to the web.Of course, Apple should be credited for seeing the opportunity to bring an AI system like Siri to the masses, by packaging it up and marketing it so people could understand its value. Siri investorGary Morgenthaler, a partner atMorgenthaler Ventures, who also invested personally in Viv Labs new round, agrees.Now 500 million people globally have access to Siri, he says. More than 200 million people use it monthly, and more than 100 million people use it every day. By my count, thats the fastest uptake of any technology in history  faster than DVD, faster than smartphones  its just amazing, Morgenthaler adds.But Siri today is limited. While shes able to perform simpler tasks, like checking your calendar or, she struggles to piece information together. She cant answer questions that she hasnt already been programmed to understand.Viv is different. It can parse natural language and complex queries, linking different third-party sources of information together in order to answer the query at hand. And it does so quickly, and in a way that will make it an ideal user interface for the coming Internet of Things  that is, the networked, everyday objects that well interact with using voice commands.Aabout Viv and its creators described the system as one thatwill be taught by the world, know more than it was taught and it will learn something new everyday.Morgenthaler, who says hes seen Viv in action, calls it impressive.It does what it claims to do, he says. The part that still needs to be put into action, however, is the most crucial: Viv needs to be programmed by the world in order to really come to life.While to some extent, Viv is the next iteration of Siri in terms of this vision of connecting people to aworld of knowledge thats accessed via voice commands, in many ways its very different. Its potentially much more powerful than other intelligent assistants accessed by voice,including not only Sir, but also Google Now, Microsofts Cortana or .Unlike Siri, the system is not static. Viv will have memory.It will understand its users in the aggregate, with respect to their language, their behavior, and their intent, explainsMorgenthaler. But it will also understand you and your own behavior and preferences, he says. It willadjust its weighting and probabilities so it gets things right more often. So it will learn from its experiences in that regard, he says.In Viv was described as being valuable to the service economy, ordering an Uber for you because you told the system Im drunk, for example, or making all the arrangements for your Match.com date including the car, the reservations and even flowers.Another option could be booking flights for business travelers, who speak multi-partqueries like I want a short flight to San Francisco with a return three days later via Dallas. Viv would show you your options and youd tell it to book the ticket  which it would proceed to do for you, already knowing things like your seat and meal preferences as well as yourfrequent flyer number.Also unlike Siri today, Viv will be open to third-party developers. And it will be significantly easier for developers to add new functionality to Viv, as compared toSiri in the past. This openness will allow Viv to add new domains of knowledge to its global brain more quickly.Having learned from their experiences with Apple, the Viv Labsteam is not looking to sell its AI to a single company but instead is pursuing a business model where Viv will be made available to anyone with the goal of becoming a ubiquitous technology.In the future, if the team succeeds, a Viv icon may be found on Internet-connected devices, informing you of the devices AI capabilities.For that reason, the investment by Iconiq makes sense, givenits clients run some of the largest Internet companies today.We understand that Viv will launch a beta of its software sometime this year, which will be the firststep towards having it programmed by the world.Morgenthaler says theres no question that the team can deliver  after all, they took Siri from the whiteboard to a world-changing technology in just 28 months, he notes. The questions instead for Viv Labs are around scalability and its ability to bring in developers. It needs to deliver on all these bigpromises to users, and generate sufficient interest from the wider developer community. It also needs to find a distribution path and partners who will help bring it to market  again, things that Iconiq can help with.But Viv Labs is not alone in pursing itsgoal. Google , has since gone on to and, , has alsohired AI legendsGeoffrey Hinton and Ray Kurzweil to .Viv may not deliver on its full vision right out of the gate, but itscore engine has been built at this point and it works. Plus,the timing for AIs next step feelsright.The idea of embedding a microphone and Internet access is plummeting in price, says Morgenthaler. If access to global intelligence and the ability to recognize you, recognize your speech, understand what you said, and provide you services in an authenticated way  if that is available, thats really transformative.", "title": "Viv, Built By Siris Creators, Scores $12.5 Million For An AI Technology That Can Teach"},

The docking design serves both form and function, giving you a better looking option without a complicated and cumbersome case removal process for the backup battery itself.The version I reviewed featured the matte black finish, which is a good standard look for people with more conservative tastes in accessories. The cutouts provide access to the camera, power and volume buttons and speakers/headphone/Lightning jack, and when you plug the slim case into the battery there are speaker redirect ports so that you dont lose sound. When the cases are combined, the Boostcase feels very solid, as if it was one piece, but it also loses most of its design originality  at a glance, most would probably just assume you had a Mophie or something generic.Still, the battery portion is mostly functional, so thats not really a hit against it. The bottom of the device features a physical switch for turning the flow of power on and off, and theres also an LED battery indicator to tell you how much charge is left. Unlike on competing devices, such as the Mophie series, this light is a continuous strip that actually wraps around the bottom edge of the device. While some may appreciate the unique design, I found myself missing the series of discrete LEDs used by others, since it provides a much easier way to accurately assess how much charge you have left in the tank at a glance.Overall, though, the modularity of the Boostcase design makes up for the LED quibble, leaving this as one of the best options out there in terms of looks for those who dont want to sacrifice fashion for the sake of power.The Boostcase for iPhone 6 does indeed extend the life of your device considerably, and in my testing has more than doubled my usual usage time before requiring a charge. Ive repeatedly managed to get more than two days of iPhone time without having to plug in, and I find that using it switched on even when the iPhones fully charged to continually provide a top-off adds maximizes your practical use time.Boostcases modular snap-in design is sometimes a bit too good at keeping the iPhone 6 with the slim case in place  it requires a good bit of elbow grease to get it to slide out. This is mostly to the credit of the design, however, since it means theres no wiggle at all between the two components, and no danger that the top portion will separate accidentally.The iPhone 6 Plus best feature might be its extensive battery life, but with the Boostcase, you get very similar performance, with the accessory possibly helping the iPhone 6 edge out its larger sibling. Im not a case fan in general, but in situations where extra power is needed, I appreciate having the option to pare down to something much sleeker in a pinch.The Boostcase for iPhone 6 is a smart take on the standard battery backup accessory design, with a unique feature thats actually practical and well-executed. If youre looking for spare juice, there are definitely cheaper options out there, including standalone external battery packs, but the Boostcase has MFI certification from Apple, and modularity that doesnt altogether sacrifice the benefits of a slim iPhone design for spare power.", "title": "Boostcase For iPhone 6 Review: Modular Power Helps SaveFace"},

Originally shown off by frequent Android leaker account , the videos below show the M9 in detail, including its design, as well as software features contained in the next version of HTCs Sense UI.The first video reveals a thorough overview of the M9, curiously presented in profile view. The phone looks a lot like its predecessor, but has a two-tone metal body. Theres a personalization option that lets you use a source image for theme, and a contextual home screen widget that changes apps based on your location. A new front camera uses UltraPixel tech for optimal low-light shooting, and a rear-facing 20 megapixel delivers more detail and resolution.The second video shows off a better look at how the HTC One M9s software features might fit into a users actual day, including a photo capture and theming example with a picture from a store window. HTC clearly wants to highlight personalization options, as well as the new meal recommendations built into BlinkFeed.Finally, a more in-depth look at the camera reveals some of the improved capture abilities, in a variety of lighting conditions, as well as new effects and options build into the camera app for after-capture processing and edits. The videos above might get taken down, but we have a gallery of captures from each that should provide a look everything regardless of whether the YouTube clips stay active.", "title": "Heres The HTC One M9, As Revealed In New LeakedVideos"},

The move makes sense in light of Mac OS Xs public beta program, which debuted last year and offered a select group of users (Apple said it had room for one million participants in the program) access to Yosemite ahead of its public launch.TechCrunch has heard previously that Apple might consider such a move if the OS X program proved successful, so it makes sense that they would pursue a similar course of action on the mobile software side. Apples decision to make a public beta channel of releases available for OS X (which differ from its Developer Preview builds, which are more prone to include bugs) stemmed from a desire to have more pre-launch feedback, both in terms of sheer sample size, and in terms of getting it in the hands of people who would more closely resemble the bulk of the population using the final consumer release in terms of habits, practices and needs.The thinking was that more eyes on the pre-launch software, trying more things that ordinary people would be doing with their Macs on a daily basis would lead to greater stability in the final shipping software. And OS X provided a great test bed  while the Mac user population is strong, its nowhere near as massive as the iOS user base, and the scrutiny on future software among both competitors and the media is far less intense. OS X presented a relatively safe space to try out a public beta test, and if the benefits outweigh the negatives, it makes all the sense in the world to try to bring that to iOS, too.iOS has drawn criticism from some for bugginess in recent releases, and a larger pre-launch test pool could definitely help address that. Apple also looks poised to add plenty to its mobile OS in upcoming releases, including , a rumored new streaming music service based on Beats tech and ample stability and reliability fixes coming in iOS 9, so this would seem like a logical time to get more help in pre-launch testing.9to5Mac says that the iOS beta program will be launched to a limited group of only 100,000 non-developer testers, which would be a far smaller segment than is allowed into the OS X beta program. Again, the stakes are higher here, which could account for the need for a more tightly controlled group, but any pre-launch access will inevitably change the way Apples upcoming software is covered and discussed, so itll be interesting to see how Apples media strategy shifts if this proves true.", "title": "Apple Said To Be Planning OS X-Like Public Beta Seed Program For iOS,Too"},
